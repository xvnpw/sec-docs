*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious Markdown input containing JavaScript code or HTML elements that execute JavaScript. When Parsedown processes this input, it generates HTML that includes the malicious script. This script then executes in the victim's browser when they view the content, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or deface the website.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the user's session and account, redirection to malicious websites, theft of sensitive information, defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected Parsedown Component:** Core parsing logic and HTML generation. Specifically, the parts of the code responsible for handling inline HTML, image tags, and potentially other Markdown features that can be abused to inject scripts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust output encoding/escaping of the HTML generated by Parsedown, appropriate for the output context (e.g., HTML escaping for display in HTML).
        *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   Regularly update Parsedown to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Consider using a stricter Markdown parsing configuration or a more secure alternative if the application doesn't require the full flexibility of Parsedown.

*   **Threat:** HTML Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary HTML code through Markdown that Parsedown renders without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to manipulate the structure and content of the webpage, potentially leading to phishing attacks or misleading users. The injected HTML might not necessarily execute JavaScript but can still alter the intended presentation.
    *   **Impact:**  Phishing attacks by displaying fake login forms or other deceptive content, defacement of the website, misleading users with altered information.
    *   **Affected Parsedown Component:** Core parsing logic and HTML generation. Specifically, the parts of the code that handle inline HTML and the translation of Markdown syntax to HTML elements.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust output encoding/escaping of the HTML generated by Parsedown.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any HTML tags or attributes that Parsedown allows.
        *   Consider using a stricter Markdown parsing configuration or a more secure alternative if the application doesn't require the full flexibility of Parsedown.
        *   Implement input validation to restrict the types of HTML tags and attributes allowed in user-provided Markdown.

*   **Threat:** Bypass of Content Security Policy (CSP) through Unsafe HTML Generation
    *   **Description:** Parsedown might generate HTML that, while not directly containing `<script>` tags, uses attributes or elements that can be exploited to execute JavaScript, effectively bypassing the application's Content Security Policy. This could involve attributes like `onerror`, `onload`, or `onmouseover` within allowed HTML tags.
    *   **Impact:**  Weakening or complete bypass of the application's CSP, allowing for XSS attacks even with a CSP in place.
    *   **Affected Parsedown Component:** HTML generation. Specifically, the parts of the code that handle attributes of HTML elements generated from Markdown.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a strict CSP that restricts inline scripts and event handlers.
        *   Carefully review the HTML generated by Parsedown to ensure it doesn't contain attributes that can be used for script execution.
        *   Consider using a Markdown parser with stricter control over the generated HTML attributes.
        *   Implement output encoding/escaping even when a CSP is in place as a defense-in-depth measure.
