## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Unfiltered HTML Tags (Parsedown)

**Introduction:**

As a cybersecurity expert collaborating with the development team, I've conducted a deep analysis of the "Inject Unfiltered HTML Tags" attack path within the context of an application using the Parsedown library (https://github.com/erusev/parsedown). This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the attack mechanism, its potential impact, and actionable recommendations for mitigation.

**Understanding the Vulnerability Context: Parsedown and Raw HTML**

Parsedown is a popular PHP library for converting Markdown into HTML. A key characteristic of Parsedown is its deliberate allowance of certain raw HTML tags within the Markdown input. This design choice provides flexibility for users who need to incorporate specific HTML elements not easily representable in standard Markdown.

However, this feature becomes a significant security vulnerability if the application doesn't implement proper sanitization of the resulting HTML before rendering it to the user's browser. The "Inject Unfiltered HTML Tags" attack path directly exploits this potential lack of adequate sanitization.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

**1. Attack Vector: Leveraging Parsedown's Raw HTML Feature:**

* **Mechanism:** Attackers can embed malicious HTML tags directly within the Markdown content they control. This can occur through various input points within the application, including:
    * **User-Generated Content:** Comments, forum posts, blog entries, profile descriptions, etc.
    * **Configuration Files:** If the application uses Markdown for configuration and doesn't sanitize it.
    * **Database Entries:** If Markdown content is stored in the database and subsequently rendered without sanitization.
    * **API Inputs:** If the application accepts Markdown through an API endpoint.

* **Key Vulnerability:** The application fails to adequately sanitize the HTML output generated by Parsedown before presenting it to the user's browser. This allows the browser to interpret and execute the malicious HTML code.

**2. Exploitable HTML Tags and their Potential Impact:**

The following HTML tags are particularly dangerous when injected without proper sanitization:

* **`<script>`:** This is the most common vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Attackers can inject JavaScript code that can:
    * Steal session cookies and hijack user accounts.
    * Redirect users to malicious websites.
    * Modify the content of the page.
    * Execute actions on behalf of the user.
    * Inject keyloggers or other malware.

* **`<iframe>`:** Allows embedding external content. Attackers can use this to:
    * Display fake login forms to steal credentials (phishing).
    * Embed content from malicious websites.
    * Perform clickjacking attacks.
    * Track user activity across domains.

* **`<object>`, `<embed>`, `<applet>`:** These tags can embed various types of external resources, including Flash content, Java applets, and other plugins. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in these plugins or use them to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.

* **`<a>` with `javascript:` URI:** While Parsedown might sanitize basic `<a>` tags, attackers could potentially craft payloads that bypass sanitization or exploit edge cases to execute JavaScript through the `href` attribute.

* **Event Handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`):** These attributes can be attached to various HTML tags and trigger JavaScript execution upon specific events. Even seemingly innocuous tags can become dangerous when combined with these handlers.

**3. Attack Scenarios and Examples:**

* **Scenario 1: Comment Section XSS:** A user submits a comment containing the following Markdown:
   ```markdown
   This is a great article! <script>alert('You have been hacked!');</script>
   ```
   If the application doesn't sanitize the output, other users viewing this comment will have the JavaScript `alert()` function executed in their browsers.

* **Scenario 2: Profile Defacement via `<iframe>`:** A user modifies their profile description to include the following Markdown:
   ```markdown
   Check out my awesome website! <iframe src="https://malicious.example.com"></iframe>
   ```
   When other users view this profile, their browser will load and display the content from `malicious.example.com` within the iframe.

* **Scenario 3: Data Exfiltration through `<object>`:** An attacker injects an `<object>` tag that attempts to load a resource from their server, potentially leaking sensitive information through HTTP Referer headers or other side-channel attacks.

**4. Impact Assessment:**

The successful injection of unfiltered HTML tags can have severe consequences:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the most likely and significant impact. XSS can lead to account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, and website defacement.
* **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing pages or websites hosting malware.
* **Clickjacking:** Attackers can overlay invisible elements on the page, tricking users into performing unintended actions.
* **Session Hijacking:** By stealing session cookies, attackers can impersonate legitimate users.
* **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can access and transmit sensitive data from the user's browser.
* **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the appearance and content of the website.
* **Malware Distribution:** Through iframes or other embedded content, attackers can distribute malware to unsuspecting users.

**5. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations for the Development Team:**

To effectively mitigate the "Inject Unfiltered HTML Tags" vulnerability, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Robust Sanitization:** This is the **most critical step**. The application **must** sanitize the HTML output generated by Parsedown before rendering it to the user's browser. Several approaches can be used:
    * **Allowlisting:** Define a strict set of allowed HTML tags and attributes. Discard or escape anything not on the whitelist. Libraries like **HTML Purifier** (for PHP) are specifically designed for this purpose and are highly recommended.
    * **Contextual Output Encoding:** Escape HTML entities based on the context where the data is being displayed. For example, use `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP for displaying content within HTML tags. However, this alone is often insufficient for complex HTML structures and is best used in conjunction with allowlisting.
    * **Consider Parsedown's Configuration (with caution):** While Parsedown allows raw HTML by default, there might be configuration options to disable or restrict certain tag types. However, relying solely on Parsedown's configuration for security is generally not recommended as it might not cover all potential attack vectors.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts and restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

* **Input Validation:** While not a direct solution to the raw HTML issue, validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths. This can help prevent attackers from injecting excessively long or malformed payloads.

* **Regular Updates:** Keep Parsedown and all other dependencies updated to the latest versions. Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in these libraries.

* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including those related to Markdown processing and HTML sanitization.

* **Educate Users (Where Applicable):** If users are allowed to input Markdown, educate them about the risks of including raw HTML and provide guidelines on safe usage. However, relying on user behavior for security is not a primary defense.

* **Consider Alternative Markdown Libraries (If Raw HTML is Rarely Needed):** If the need for raw HTML is minimal, consider using a more restrictive Markdown library that doesn't allow raw HTML by default.

**Code Examples (Illustrative - PHP):**

**Vulnerable Code (Without Sanitization):**

```php
<?php
require_once 'Parsedown.php';
$parsedown = new Parsedown();
$markdown_input = $_POST['user_content']; // User-provided Markdown
$html_output = $parsedown->text($markdown_input);
echo $html_output; // Directly outputting the unsanitized HTML - DANGEROUS
?>
```

**Secure Code (Using HTML Purifier for Sanitization):**

```php
<?php
require_once 'Parsedown.php';
require_once 'HTMLPurifier/HTMLPurifier.auto.php';

$parsedown = new Parsedown();
$markdown_input = $_POST['user_content'];

// Convert Markdown to HTML
$html_output = $parsedown->text($markdown_input);

// Configure HTML Purifier
$config = HTMLPurifier_Config::createDefault();
// Customize allowed elements and attributes as needed
$config->set('HTML.Allowed', 'p, strong, em, a[href], br'); // Example whitelist

$purifier = new HTMLPurifier($config);
$sanitized_html = $purifier->purify($html_output);

echo $sanitized_html; // Outputting the sanitized HTML
?>
```

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Unfiltered HTML Tags" attack path, inherent in Parsedown's design to allow raw HTML, presents a significant security risk if not properly addressed. The potential for XSS and other malicious activities is high. It is crucial that the development team prioritizes **robust sanitization** of the HTML output generated by Parsedown. Implementing allowlisting with a dedicated library like HTML Purifier, combined with other security measures such as CSP, regular updates, and security audits, is essential to protect the application and its users from this critical vulnerability. Failing to do so could lead to serious security breaches and compromise the integrity and trustworthiness of the application.
