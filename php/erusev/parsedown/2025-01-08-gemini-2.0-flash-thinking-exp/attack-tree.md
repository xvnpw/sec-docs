## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Markdown](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities_-_inject_malicious_htmljavascript_via_markdo_f9818f5c.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage Parsedown's functionality to process Markdown and convert it into HTML. By crafting specific Markdown input, they aim to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the final output. This path is high-risk because successful injection can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other serious vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Bypass Sanitization/Encoding Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_bypass_sanitizationencoding_mechanisms.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Applications often implement sanitization or encoding on the output of Parsedown to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. This critical node represents the attacker's attempt to circumvent these security measures. Successful bypass allows the injected malicious HTML/JavaScript to be rendered and executed by the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Unfiltered HTML Tags](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_unfiltered_html_tags.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Parsedown allows some raw HTML tags to be included in Markdown. If the application's sanitization is insufficient or improperly configured, attackers can inject dangerous HTML tags like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, or `<object>` directly into the Markdown, leading to the execution of arbitrary scripts or embedding of malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Attributes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_attributes.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Even if direct `<script>` tags are blocked, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript through HTML attributes that support event handlers (e.g., `onerror`, `onload`, `onmouseover`). By crafting Markdown that results in HTML tags with these malicious attributes, they can trigger JavaScript execution when the event occurs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious URLs](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_urls.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers can inject malicious URLs, particularly those using the `javascript:` or `data:` URI schemes, into Markdown links or image sources. When the browser encounters these URLs, it can execute the embedded JavaScript code or load malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Markdown -> Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities_-_inject_malicious_htmljavascript_via_markdo_4d534e35.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path represents the culmination of successful injection. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs when the attacker's injected malicious script is executed in the context of the user's browser when they view the page containing the Parsedown output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_achieve_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Successful XSS allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can have severe consequences, including:
    * **Stealing Session Cookies/Tokens:** Attackers can steal session cookies or authentication tokens, allowing them to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their account.
    * **Performing Actions on Behalf of User:** Attackers can perform actions on the application as if they were the logged-in user, such as modifying data, making purchases, or sending messages.
    * **Redirecting User to Malicious Site:** Attackers can redirect the user to a phishing website or a site hosting malware, potentially leading to credential theft or system compromise.
