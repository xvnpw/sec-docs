# Attack Surface Analysis for erusev/parsedown

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Inline HTML](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_inline_html.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTML, including `<script>` tags, directly into Markdown content.
    *   **How Parsedown Contributes:** By default, Parsedown parses and renders inline HTML tags present in the Markdown input.
    *   **Example:**  Markdown input: `This is some text <script>alert('XSS!')</script>`
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Inline HTML:** Configure Parsedown to disallow or strip inline HTML tags. Parsedown offers options to control this.
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape the HTML output generated by Parsedown before rendering it in the browser. This prevents the browser from interpreting injected HTML as executable code.
        *   **Use a Dedicated HTML Sanitizer:**  Process the Parsedown output with a dedicated HTML sanitization library (like HTMLPurifier) to remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML elements and attributes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and other browser behaviors, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `javascript:` URLs in Links and Images](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via__javascript__urls_in_links_and_images.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft Markdown links or images with `javascript:` URLs, causing JavaScript execution when a user interacts with them.
    *   **How Parsedown Contributes:** Parsedown parses and renders these URLs within the `<a>` or `<img>` tags.
    *   **Example:** Markdown input: `[Click me](javascript:alert('XSS!'))` or `![Image](javascript:alert('XSS!'))`
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, similar to inline HTML XSS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **URL Sanitization:**  Sanitize URLs in the Parsedown output to remove or neutralize `javascript:` schemes.
        *   **Disable or Filter Unsafe Protocols:** Configure Parsedown or use a post-processing step to disallow or filter out potentially dangerous URL protocols.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  While less direct, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact if other defenses fail.

## Attack Surface: [Relying Solely on Parsedown for Security Sanitization](./attack_surfaces/relying_solely_on_parsedown_for_security_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:** Developers incorrectly assume that Parsedown inherently provides sufficient security sanitization against malicious input.
    *   **How Parsedown Contributes:** Parsedown is primarily a *parser*, not a dedicated *sanitizer*. While it escapes some characters, it's not designed to be a comprehensive security tool.
    *   **Example:**  Directly rendering Parsedown output without any further encoding or sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Vulnerability to various injection attacks, primarily XSS and HTML injection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Understand Parsedown's Limitations:** Recognize that Parsedown's primary function is parsing, not security.
        *   **Implement Additional Security Measures:** Always employ output encoding/escaping and consider using a dedicated HTML sanitizer on the Parsedown output.
        *   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit the application's use of Parsedown to ensure proper security practices are in place.

## Attack Surface: [Using an Outdated or Vulnerable Version of Parsedown](./attack_surfaces/using_an_outdated_or_vulnerable_version_of_parsedown.md)

*   **Description:** Employing a version of the Parsedown library with known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Parsedown Contributes:** Older versions might contain bugs or security flaws that attackers can exploit.
    *   **Example:**  Using a version with a publicly disclosed XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure to known exploits, potentially leading to various security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Parsedown library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (like Composer for PHP) to easily manage and update your dependencies.
        *   **Security Scanning:** Utilize security scanning tools that can identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
