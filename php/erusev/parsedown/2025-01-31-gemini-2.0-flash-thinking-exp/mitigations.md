# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for erusev/parsedown

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Allowed Markdown Features](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_allowed_markdown_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Necessary Features:** Analyze your application's requirements and determine the essential Markdown features users need *specifically processed by Parsedown*.
    2.  **Consult Parsedown Documentation:** Review Parsedown's documentation to understand available configuration options for disabling or limiting features *within Parsedown*. Focus on options like HTML tag handling and potentially risky elements that Parsedown processes.
    3.  **Configuration Implementation:** In your application's backend code where Parsedown is initialized, configure Parsedown *directly* to disable or restrict unnecessary features using Parsedown's API. For example, use Parsedown's options to strip or escape HTML tags if raw HTML input is not required to be parsed by Parsedown.
    4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the application after Parsedown configuration changes to ensure that essential Markdown functionality *processed by Parsedown* remains while risky features *handled by Parsedown* are effectively limited.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Severity. By limiting HTML tag parsing *within Parsedown*, you reduce the attack surface for injecting malicious scripts through Markdown input *that Parsedown processes as HTML*.
    *   **HTML Injection:** Medium Severity. Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary HTML elements *that Parsedown would parse and output* which could be used for phishing or defacement.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** High Impact. Significantly reduces the risk of XSS if HTML parsing is disabled or strictly controlled *within Parsedown's processing*.
    *   **HTML Injection:** Medium Impact. Reduces the risk of unwanted HTML content injection *through Parsedown's output*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in the backend Markdown processing service. HTML tag parsing is currently enabled in Parsedown to support image embedding and basic formatting.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular control over HTML attributes *within Parsedown configuration* is missing. Currently, all HTML attributes are allowed if HTML parsing is enabled in Parsedown. Need to implement a stricter attribute whitelist or sanitization for HTML tags *within Parsedown's options* if HTML parsing is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable HTML Tag Parsing (If Possible)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_html_tag_parsing__if_possible_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess HTML Requirement (for Parsedown):** Re-evaluate if your application truly requires users to input raw HTML *that needs to be parsed by Parsedown* within Markdown. If not, disabling HTML parsing in Parsedown is the most secure option *specifically for Parsedown's processing*.
    2.  **Parsedown Configuration:** Utilize Parsedown's configuration options *directly* to disable HTML tag parsing. This typically involves setting a configuration flag or using a specific API method provided by Parsedown.
    3.  **Testing:** Test all Markdown rendering functionalities after disabling HTML parsing in Parsedown to ensure no essential features *relying on Parsedown's HTML parsing* are broken and that HTML tags are indeed being stripped or escaped *by Parsedown* as configured.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Severity. Disabling HTML parsing *in Parsedown* completely eliminates the primary attack vector for XSS through Markdown input *when using Parsedown's HTML parsing capabilities*.
    *   **HTML Injection:** High Severity. Prevents any form of arbitrary HTML injection *through Parsedown's output of HTML tags*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** High Impact.  Provides the strongest possible mitigation against XSS related to *Parsedown's HTML parsing capabilities*.
    *   **HTML Injection:** High Impact. Completely eliminates HTML injection risk *originating from Parsedown's HTML parsing*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HTML tag parsing is currently enabled in Parsedown.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to implement Parsedown configuration to disable HTML tag parsing in the backend Markdown processing service. This is a high priority mitigation to implement *specifically for Parsedown*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Consider Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_consider_extensions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Extension Review (Parsedown Extensions):** Before using any Parsedown extension, thoroughly review its source code, author reputation, and update history. Focus specifically on extensions designed for Parsedown.
    2.  **Security Audit (If Possible - Parsedown Extensions):** If using third-party Parsedown extensions, ideally conduct a security audit of the extension code to identify potential vulnerabilities *introduced by the extension itself*.
    3.  **Minimal Usage (Parsedown Extensions):** Only use Parsedown extensions that are absolutely necessary for your application's functionality. Avoid using unnecessary or poorly maintained Parsedown extensions.
    4.  **Regular Updates (Parsedown Extensions):** If using Parsedown extensions, ensure they are regularly updated to patch any discovered vulnerabilities *within the extensions*. Monitor extension repositories for security advisories and updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Parsedown Extensions:** Medium to High Severity.  Malicious or poorly written Parsedown extensions can introduce new vulnerabilities, including XSS, code injection, or other security flaws, into your application *through the extension's code interacting with Parsedown*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Parsedown Extensions:** Medium Impact.  Reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through Parsedown extensions by careful selection and review. Impact depends on the severity of vulnerabilities present in extensions if used carelessly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No Parsedown extensions are currently used in the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If considering using Parsedown extensions in the future, a formal process for reviewing and vetting Parsedown extensions needs to be established before integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Encoding and Contextual Escaping (Post-Parsedown Output)](./mitigation_strategies/output_encoding_and_contextual_escaping__post-parsedown_output_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Output Contexts (of Parsedown):** Determine all contexts where Parsedown output (the HTML generated by Parsedown) is displayed in your application.
    2.  **Choose Appropriate Encoding:** Select the correct output encoding method for each context *where Parsedown's output is used*.
        *   **HTML Context:** Use HTML entity encoding for Parsedown output.
        *   **JavaScript Context:** Use JavaScript escaping for Parsedown output if embedded in JavaScript.
        *   **URL Context:** Use URL encoding for Parsedown output if used in URLs.
    3.  **Implement Contextual Escaping:** Integrate context-aware output encoding into your application's templating system or output rendering logic *specifically for Parsedown's output*. Ensure that Parsedown output is always escaped appropriately before being displayed in any context.
    4.  **Code Review:** Conduct code reviews to verify that output encoding is consistently applied to *all Parsedown output* in all relevant parts of the application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Severity. Contextual escaping of Parsedown output is a crucial defense against XSS. It ensures that even if malicious content is present in Parsedown output, it will be rendered as plain text in the browser, preventing script execution *from Parsedown's generated HTML*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** High Impact.  Provides a strong defense against XSS by neutralizing malicious scripts in *Parsedown's output*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic HTML entity encoding is used in the templating engine for general output, including Parsedown output.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Contextual escaping is not consistently applied across all output contexts *specifically for Parsedown output*. Need to review and enhance templating logic to ensure context-aware escaping, especially for Parsedown output that might be placed in JavaScript or URL contexts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Parsedown Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_parsedown_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitoring Updates (Parsedown):** Subscribe to Parsedown project's release notes, security advisories, or commit activity (e.g., GitHub notifications) to stay informed about Parsedown updates.
    2.  **Update Process (Parsedown):** Establish a process for regularly checking for Parsedown updates and applying them to your application's dependencies.
    3.  **Testing After Updates (Parsedown):** After updating Parsedown, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility with the new Parsedown version and that no regressions or new issues are introduced *due to the Parsedown update*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Parsedown Vulnerabilities:** High Severity. Outdated versions of Parsedown may contain known security vulnerabilities *within Parsedown itself* that are publicly disclosed and can be exploited by attackers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Parsedown Vulnerabilities:** High Impact.  Regular Parsedown updates ensure that known vulnerabilities *in Parsedown* are patched promptly, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation *of Parsedown vulnerabilities*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Parsedown version is managed using a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, composer).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated process for checking for Parsedown updates and notifying developers. Need to implement a system for regularly checking for Parsedown updates and triggering update process *specifically for Parsedown dependency*.
