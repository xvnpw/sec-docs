# BUSINESS POSTURE

Parsedown is a Markdown parser library written in PHP. The primary business goal for a project utilizing Parsedown is to efficiently and accurately convert Markdown formatted text into HTML for display or further processing within web applications or other systems.

Business priorities for projects using Parsedown typically include:
- Ease of integration: Parsedown should be simple to incorporate into existing PHP projects.
- Performance: The parsing process should be fast and efficient to minimize server load and ensure a responsive user experience.
- Accuracy: Parsedown should correctly interpret the Markdown specification to render content as intended.
- Security: The parsing process must be secure and not introduce vulnerabilities into applications using it, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Key business risks associated with using Parsedown include:
- Security vulnerabilities: If Parsedown has vulnerabilities, applications using it could be exposed to security risks, especially if processing user-supplied Markdown.
- Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient parsing could lead to slow page load times or server overload, negatively impacting user experience and potentially availability.
- Incompatibility or bugs: Incorrect parsing or incompatibility with certain Markdown features could lead to content being displayed incorrectly, affecting user trust and potentially business operations if content accuracy is critical.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Input validation inherent in Markdown parsing logic to handle various Markdown syntax elements. (Implemented within Parsedown PHP code)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on the application integrating Parsedown to handle output sanitization if necessary to prevent XSS based on the context where the parsed HTML is used.
- accepted risk: Assumption that the PHP environment and server infrastructure where Parsedown is deployed are secured according to general best practices.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security testing, including static analysis security testing (SAST) and potentially fuzzing, to identify potential vulnerabilities in Parsedown code.
- security control: Integrate Parsedown into a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) that includes security reviews and code analysis.
- security control: Consider output sanitization of the HTML generated by Parsedown within the integrating application, especially when handling user-provided Markdown, to mitigate potential XSS risks.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Parsedown as a library. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using Parsedown.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to Parsedown as a library. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using Parsedown to control access to content and functionality.
- Input validation: Parsedown must perform robust input validation to correctly parse Markdown syntax and handle potentially malicious or unexpected input without causing errors or security issues. This is critical to prevent injection attacks.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to Parsedown as a Markdown parsing library. Cryptographic functions might be used by applications that utilize Parsedown, but are not a core requirement for Parsedown itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process: Secure and accurate rendering of Markdown content within web applications to ensure correct information display and prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS.

Data we are trying to protect:
- Markdown content: User-provided or application-managed Markdown text. Sensitivity depends on the application context. If it includes sensitive information, confidentiality and integrity are important.
- Parsed HTML output: The HTML generated by Parsedown. Integrity is important to ensure it accurately represents the original Markdown and does not introduce malicious code.

Data sensitivity: Sensitivity of Markdown content and parsed HTML output is context-dependent. In many web applications, user-generated content can be considered moderately sensitive, requiring protection against unauthorized modification and malicious injection. In applications dealing with highly confidential data, the sensitivity would be higher.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific applications that will be using Parsedown? (e.g., blog platform, documentation system, forum)
- What is the expected volume of Markdown content processing? (e.g., requests per second, data size)
- Are there specific performance requirements for Markdown parsing? (e.g., latency, throughput)
- What is the level of security risk tolerance for applications using Parsedown? (e.g., startup vs. Fortune 500)
- Are there any specific compliance requirements that the applications using Parsedown must adhere to? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to enable efficient and secure Markdown rendering in web applications. Performance and security are key priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Applications using Parsedown are responsible for output sanitization and overall application security. Parsedown itself focuses on secure and accurate Markdown parsing. Regular security testing and secure development practices are recommended.
- DESIGN: Parsedown is used as a library within PHP-based web applications. Deployment is typically in a cloud-based web hosting environment. A CI/CD pipeline is used for building and testing Parsedown.
