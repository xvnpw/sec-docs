# Threat Model Analysis for erusev/parsedown

## Threat: [HTML Injection via Markdown Features (XSS)](./threats/html_injection_via_markdown_features__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   An attacker crafts malicious Markdown input that, when parsed by Parsedown, generates HTML containing embedded JavaScript or other harmful HTML elements.
    *   This malicious HTML is then rendered by the application in a user's browser without proper output encoding.
    *   The attacker leverages Markdown features like links, images, or raw HTML (if enabled or bypassed sanitization) to inject the malicious code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
    *   Session hijacking, cookie theft, account takeover.
    *   Defacement of the webpage.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
*   **Parsedown Component Affected:**
    *   Core Parsing Engine (Handles Markdown syntax conversion to HTML).
    *   Specifically, the parsing logic for links, images, and potentially inline/block HTML elements if not handled with sufficient security considerations in the application's context.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Encode HTML entities in the output generated by Parsedown before rendering it in the browser. Use appropriate encoding functions for the output context (HTML body, attributes, etc.).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources of scripts and other resources, reducing the impact of XSS.
    *   **HTML Sanitization (Output):** Sanitize the HTML output from Parsedown using a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., HTMLPurifier) to remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes *after* Parsedown processing.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Include XSS testing in security assessments.
