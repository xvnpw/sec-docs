## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Unauthorized Access to Admin Panel [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_unauthorized_access_to_admin_panel__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the attacker's goal of bypassing authentication and gaining administrative privileges. Success here grants full control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Admin Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__to_steal_admin_credentials__critical_node_.md)

This critical node describes the attack vector where an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Typecho page that is subsequently viewed by an administrator.
    *   **Inject malicious script into a Typecho page viewed by admin:** This involves finding input fields or areas within Typecho where user-supplied content is rendered without proper sanitization, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
        *   **Stored XSS in comments, posts, or theme options:** The malicious script is permanently stored in the database and executed whenever an administrator views the affected content.
        *   **Reflected XSS via vulnerable Typecho URL parameters:** The malicious script is embedded in a URL parameter, and when the administrator clicks on the crafted link, the script is executed in their browser.
    *   Successful execution of the malicious script in the administrator's browser can lead to the theft of their session cookies or login credentials, granting the attacker unauthorized admin access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Typecho Database Queries [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_typecho_database_queries__critical_node_.md)

This critical node focuses on the exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities, where attackers manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through user-supplied input.
    *   **Inject SQL through vulnerable comment submission:**  Attackers insert malicious SQL code within the comment submission form fields. If Typecho doesn't properly sanitize this input before using it in a database query, the injected SQL can be executed.
    *   **Inject SQL through vulnerable post creation/editing:** Similar to comment submission, attackers inject malicious SQL code within the fields used for creating or editing posts.
    *   **Inject SQL through vulnerable plugin/theme settings:** If plugins or themes have poorly written database queries that don't sanitize input from their settings, attackers can inject SQL code through these settings.
    *   **Inject SQL through vulnerable search functionality:**  If the search functionality doesn't properly sanitize the search terms before using them in a database query, attackers can inject SQL code via the search input.
    *   Successful SQL Injection can allow attackers to read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even execute operating system commands in some scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the most severe type of vulnerability, where an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Typecho application.
    *   **Exploit insecure file upload functionality in Typecho:** If Typecho allows users to upload files without proper validation, attackers can upload malicious PHP scripts.
        *   **Upload a malicious PHP script disguised as an image or other file:** Attackers attempt to bypass file type restrictions by disguising malicious PHP code as seemingly harmless files. Once uploaded, they can access this script directly via a web request, executing the code on the server.
    *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries used by Typecho:** Typecho might use third-party libraries for image manipulation. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, attackers can upload specially crafted images that trigger these vulnerabilities, leading to code execution.
    *   **Exploit deserialization vulnerabilities within Typecho code:** If Typecho uses PHP's `unserialize` function on untrusted data, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects. When `unserialize` is called on this data, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in third-party plugins/themes integrated with Typecho:** Plugins and themes often introduce vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit known flaws in these extensions to execute code on the server.
    *   Successful RCE gives the attacker complete control over the server and the application.
