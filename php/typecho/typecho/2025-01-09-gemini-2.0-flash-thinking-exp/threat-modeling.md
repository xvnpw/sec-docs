# Threat Model Analysis for typecho/typecho

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious SQL queries and inject them through vulnerable input fields within Typecho's core functionality (e.g., comment forms, search parameters) to interact with the database in unintended ways. This could involve bypassing authentication, extracting sensitive data, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (exposure of user data, posts, configuration), data manipulation (altering or deleting content), account takeover (by manipulating user credentials), potential remote code execution if database privileges are high enough.
*   **Affected Component:** Database interaction layer, specifically within functions handling user input and database queries within Typecho's core codebase (e.g., functions in `Var.php`, `Db.php`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions within Typecho's core to prevent direct SQL injection.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied data within Typecho's core before using it in database queries.
    *   Ensure the principle of least privilege is followed for database user accounts used by Typecho.
    *   Regularly update Typecho to benefit from security patches addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into website content managed by Typecho (e.g., comments, post content if unfiltered by Typecho's core) that will be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the affected page. This allows the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, account takeover, redirection to phishing or malware sites, website defacement, information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** Templating engine (`Widget` class and core template files), comment handling functionality (`Comments.php`) within Typecho's core.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust output encoding and escaping of user-generated content within Typecho's core before displaying it on the page.
    *   Utilize context-aware encoding based on where the data is being output (HTML, JavaScript, URL) within Typecho's core.
    *   Configure and enforce a Content Security Policy (CSP) at the server level to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources for the Typecho application.
    *   Regularly update Typecho to patch known XSS vulnerabilities within its core.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via File Upload Vulnerability](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_file_upload_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a flaw in Typecho's core file upload functionality (e.g., within the media library) to upload malicious executable files (e.g., PHP scripts). If these uploaded files are accessible and executable by the web server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breaches, malware installation, website defacement, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** File upload handling mechanisms in core Typecho (e.g., within the `Widget_Upload` or related classes).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation on uploads within Typecho's core, allowing only necessary and safe file types.
    *   Store uploaded files outside of the webroot or in a location where script execution is disabled (e.g., using `.htaccess` or server configuration) for files uploaded through Typecho's core functionality.
    *   Rename uploaded files handled by Typecho's core to prevent direct access and execution.
    *   Regularly scan uploaded files managed by Typecho's core for malware.
    *   Ensure proper authentication and authorization for file uploads within Typecho's core.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit weaknesses in Typecho's core authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to administrative or user accounts without providing valid credentials. This could be due to flaws in password hashing, session management, or logic errors in the core authentication process.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data manipulation, website defacement, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** User authentication system (`Users.php`, `Auth.php`), session management functions within Typecho's core.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong and well-vetted password hashing algorithms within Typecho's core.
    *   Implement secure session management practices (e.g., using HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies, session regeneration) within Typecho's core.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for users of the Typecho application.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication for administrator accounts if supported or through a plugin.
    *   Regularly audit the core authentication logic for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal](./threats/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths in requests to Typecho's core functionality to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot on the server. This could allow them to read sensitive configuration files, source code, or other system files.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (configuration details, database credentials), potential for further exploitation if sensitive files are accessed.
*   **Affected Component:** File handling functions within Typecho's core, specifically those dealing with file paths (e.g., in theme loading, file serving).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (While potentially critical depending on the files accessed, direct RCE via core path traversal is less common than other vulnerabilities). *Note: While initially rated medium, the potential impact can escalate to critical if sensitive files are exposed. Considering the request for only high/critical, and the potential for critical impact, we'll keep this.*
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly using user-supplied input in file paths within Typecho's core.
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of file paths within Typecho's core.
    *   Use absolute paths or whitelists for allowed file access within Typecho's core.
    *   Ensure the web server is configured to prevent access to sensitive directories.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** If Typecho's core uses PHP's `unserialize()` function on untrusted data without proper validation, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects that, when unserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, leading to full server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially within core Typecho's data handling or caching mechanisms if `unserialize()` is used insecurely.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `unserialize()` on untrusted data within Typecho's core.
    *   If deserialization is absolutely necessary within Typecho's core, use safer alternatives like JSON or implement strict validation and sanitization of the serialized data.
    *   Keep Typecho updated to patch any known deserialization vulnerabilities within its core.
