- Unauthorized access to blog administration and content.
- Service disruption due to security vulnerabilities or performance issues.
- Negative reputation due to security breaches or platform instability.
- Difficulty in attracting and retaining users compared to more feature-rich or commercially supported blogging platforms.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls observed or inferred from common web application practices:
- security control Input validation on web forms (inferred, needs verification in code).
- security control Password hashing for user accounts (inferred, needs verification in code).
- security control Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) is expected to be implemented by developers (inferred, needs verification and testing).
- accepted risk Reliance on user-managed hosting environments for security configuration and patching of underlying infrastructure (web server, operating system, database).
- accepted risk Security vulnerabilities in community-contributed plugins and themes.
- accepted risk Potential for security misconfigurations by users during installation and setup.

Recommended security controls to implement as high priority:
- security control Automated security vulnerability scanning (SAST/DAST) integrated into development and release process.
- security control Regular security audits and penetration testing.
- security control Security awareness training for developers and contributors.
- security control Secure coding guidelines and code review process focusing on security.
- security control Centralized security logging and monitoring.
- security control Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
- security control Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce secure connections.
- security control Regular dependency updates and vulnerability patching of third-party libraries.

Security requirements for the project:

- Authentication:
  - Only authenticated administrators should be able to access the administrative interface.
  - Strong password policies should be enforced for administrator accounts.
  - Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts.
  - Session management should be secure to prevent session hijacking.

- Authorization:
  - Role-based access control should be implemented to manage permissions for different administrative tasks.
  - Users should only be able to access and modify content they are authorized to manage.
  - Public access to blog content should be controlled and configurable.

- Input Validation:
  - All user inputs, including form data, URL parameters, and headers, must be validated to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
  - Input validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side.
  - Sanitize user-generated content before displaying it to prevent XSS attacks.

- Cryptography:
  - Sensitive data, such as user passwords, must be securely hashed using strong cryptographic algorithms.
  - Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest in the database.
  - Secure communication channels (HTTPS) must be enforced for all sensitive operations, especially login and administration.
  - Securely store and manage cryptographic keys if encryption is implemented.

## BUILD

Build Process Diagram (Simplified Example):

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[/"Developer"/] --> CodeChanges["Code Changes"]
    CodeChanges --> VCS[/"Version Control System (GitHub)"/]
    VCS --> BuildServer[/"Build Server"/]
    BuildServer --> BuildArtifacts[/"Build Artifacts (ZIP, etc.)"/]
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write and modify the Typecho source code.
2. Code Changes: Developers commit their code changes.
3. Version Control System (GitHub): Code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository. This is the central repository for the project's source code.
4. Build Server: A build server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or a local build environment) is used to automate the build process.  For a project like Typecho, the build process is likely simple and might involve:
    - Checking out the code from the VCS.
    - Running linters and static analysis security testing (SAST) tools (if configured).
    - Packaging the application files into a distributable archive (e.g., ZIP file).
5. Build Artifacts (ZIP, etc.): The build server produces build artifacts, such as ZIP archives containing the application code, ready for distribution or deployment.

Security Controls in Build Process:

- Supply Chain Security:
  - Use of a reputable version control system (GitHub).
  - Dependency management (if applicable, for PHP dependencies) to track and manage third-party libraries.
  - Verification of the integrity and authenticity of third-party dependencies.

- Build Automation:
  - Automated build process reduces manual errors and ensures consistency.
  - Use of a dedicated build server environment, separate from developer workstations.

- Security Checks During Build:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanners can be integrated into the build process to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
  - Code linters can enforce coding standards and identify potential code quality issues that might have security implications.
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning can identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

- Access Control:
  - Access to the build server and build artifacts should be restricted to authorized personnel.
  - Secure storage and transmission of build artifacts.
