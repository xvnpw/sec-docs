*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Typecho Input Points:**  Locate all points where user input is accepted by the *Typecho* application (e.g., comment forms, post creation forms in the *Typecho* admin panel, search bars, custom forms built within *Typecho* themes).
    2.  **Input Validation on the Server-Side (Typecho):** Implement server-side validation for all user inputs within *Typecho*. Utilize *Typecho's* framework or PHP for validation. This includes:
        *   **Data Type Validation (Typecho Context):** Ensure input data conforms to the expected data type within *Typecho's data model* (e.g., post IDs as integers, usernames as strings, email formats for comments).
        *   **Length Validation (Typecho Fields):** Limit the length of input fields to prevent buffer overflows and other issues, considering *Typecho's database schema and field lengths*.
        *   **Format Validation (Typecho Specific Formats):** Validate input formats using regular expressions or other methods, considering formats relevant to *Typecho* (e.g., email format for comment submissions, URL format for website fields).
        *   **Whitelist Validation (Typecho Allowed Values):** Where possible, use whitelists to only allow specific characters or patterns, especially for fields with predefined allowed values in *Typecho*.
    3.  **Sanitize User Inputs (Typecho Sanitization):** Sanitize user inputs to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or code before processing or storing them in *Typecho*. Use *Typecho's* built-in sanitization functions or established security libraries *compatible with Typecho*. Focus on sanitizing for the specific context where the data will be used within *Typecho*.
    4.  **Context-Aware Output Encoding (Typecho Templating):** Encode output data before displaying it on *Typecho* web pages. Use context-aware encoding based on where the data is being displayed within *Typecho's templating system*:
        *   **HTML Encoding (Typecho Content):** For displaying data within HTML content in *Typecho* templates (e.g., post content, comments, theme elements).
        *   **JavaScript Encoding (Typecho JavaScript):** For displaying data within JavaScript code used in *Typecho* themes or plugins.
        *   **URL Encoding (Typecho URLs):** For displaying data in URLs generated by *Typecho*.
    5.  **Secure Markdown Parsing (Typecho Markdown):** If using Markdown for user content in *Typecho* (posts, comments), ensure the Markdown parser is securely configured to prevent XSS or other vulnerabilities *within the Typecho environment*. Review any custom Markdown extensions used in *Typecho* for security implications.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Input validation and output encoding are primary defenses against XSS attacks in *Typecho*, preventing malicious scripts from being injected and executed in users' browsers when interacting with the *Typecho* site.
