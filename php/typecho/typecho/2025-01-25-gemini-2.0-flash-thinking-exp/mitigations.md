## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of `config.inc.php` (Typecho Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of__config_inc_php___typecho_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Restrict Access to `config.inc.php` via Web Server Configuration:** Ensure that the `config.inc.php` file, which contains sensitive database credentials for your Typecho installation, is not publicly accessible via the web. Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to deny direct access to this file. This is typically done using `.htaccess` files (for Apache) or server block configurations (for Nginx).
2.  **Move `config.inc.php` Outside Web Root (If Possible):** For enhanced security, consider moving the `config.inc.php` file to a location *outside* of your website's web root directory. This makes it even harder for attackers to access it directly through web requests. You will need to adjust the Typecho bootstrap code to point to the new location of the configuration file.
3.  **Secure File Permissions for `config.inc.php`:** Set restrictive file permissions for `config.inc.php` to ensure that only the web server user (and potentially the system administrator) has read access to this file. Prevent public read access.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breaches via `config.inc.php` Exposure (Critical Severity):** If `config.inc.php` is publicly accessible or improperly secured, attackers can potentially download it, obtain database credentials, and gain unauthorized access to the Typecho database, leading to data breaches and website compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breaches via `config.inc.php` Exposure:** **Critical Risk Reduction.** Properly securing `config.inc.php` is essential to prevent unauthorized access to database credentials and mitigate the risk of data breaches.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Potentially Missing:** Default Typecho installations might not automatically configure web server access restrictions for `config.inc.php`. Users need to manually configure this. Moving `config.inc.php` outside the web root is a more advanced security measure that is likely not implemented by default.
    *   **Location:** Configuration is done via web server configuration files (e.g., `.htaccess`, Nginx config) and server-level file permissions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Security Check for `config.inc.php` Accessibility:**  Potentially a security check within the Typecho admin panel to detect if `config.inc.php` is publicly accessible and provide guidance on how to secure it.
    *   **Clearer Documentation on Securing `config.inc.php`:**  Improving documentation to clearly explain the importance of securing `config.inc.php` and provide step-by-step instructions for different web server environments (Apache, Nginx, etc.).
