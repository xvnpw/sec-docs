# Attack Surface Analysis for typecho/typecho

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_brute-forcecredential_stuffing.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the `/admin/` panel by guessing usernames and passwords or using stolen credentials.
    *   **Typecho Contribution:** Typecho provides the built-in login form and authentication mechanism, which is the target of these attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a list of common passwords and usernames to try to log in to the Typecho admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Complete site compromise, data theft, defacement, malware injection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all admin accounts.
        *   **Users:** Enable a two-factor authentication (2FA) plugin.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Implement and monitor robust login attempt rate limiting (beyond Typecho's defaults if necessary).
        *   **Developers/Users:** Consider IP address whitelisting for the `/admin/` directory (if feasible).
        *   **Developers/Users:** Regularly review and update security plugins that enhance login security.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party plugins introduce security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, file inclusion, etc.) due to coding errors or lack of security best practices.
    *   **Typecho Contribution:** Typecho's plugin architecture allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP code within the context of the application, making plugin vulnerabilities directly exploitable.
    *   **Example:** A poorly coded plugin uses unsanitized user input in a database query, leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Site compromise, data theft, defacement, malware injection, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (Typecho official repository, reputable developers).
        *   **Users:** Keep *all* plugins updated to their latest versions.
        *   **Users:** Minimize the number of installed plugins. Use only essential plugins.
        *   **Developers:** Perform code reviews of plugins before installation, especially for critical functionality.
        *   **Developers:** Monitor security advisories for known plugin vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** Remove or disable any unused or abandoned plugins.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (within Admin Panel)](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities__within_admin_panel_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in file upload functionality (e.g., in the media manager) to upload malicious files (web shells, etc.).
    *   **Typecho Contribution:** Typecho provides built-in file upload functionality within the admin panel, which is a potential target.
    *   **Example:** An attacker bypasses file type validation and uploads a PHP shell disguised as an image.
    *   **Impact:** Complete site compromise, code execution, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement *very* strict file type validation, using both MIME type checking *and* content inspection (not just file extensions).
        *   **Developers:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible, or configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts within the upload directory.
        *   **Developers:** Restrict upload permissions to trusted users only.
        *   **Developers:** Sanitize filenames to prevent directory traversal attacks.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Use security plugins that enhance file upload security.

## Attack Surface: [Core Typecho Vulnerabilities (Zero-Days)](./attack_surfaces/core_typecho_vulnerabilities__zero-days_.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered vulnerabilities in the core Typecho codebase itself could be exploited.
    *   **Typecho Contribution:** This is inherent to using *any* software; Typecho's core code is the foundation of the application.
    *   **Example:** A researcher discovers a previously unknown SQL injection vulnerability in Typecho's core comment handling logic.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability; could range from information disclosure to complete site compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Unknown (potentially Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users:** Keep Typecho updated to the *absolute latest* version.  This is the most important mitigation.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Monitor Typecho security advisories and mailing lists for announcements of new vulnerabilities and patches.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help mitigate zero-day attacks.
        *   **Developers:** If modifying core Typecho code, follow secure coding practices rigorously.

## Attack Surface: [Database Operations in Admin Panel](./attack_surfaces/database_operations_in_admin_panel.md)

*   **Description:** Direct database operations, if available through the admin panel, could be misused.
    *   **Typecho Contribution:** Typecho may offer some database management features within the admin panel.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with admin access uses a database query tool within the admin panel to extract sensitive data or modify database tables.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, site disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid providing direct database manipulation tools within the admin panel.
        *   **Developers/Users:** If such tools are absolutely necessary, restrict access to them to highly trusted users only.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Implement strong database user permissions to limit the potential damage from compromised accounts.
