# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typecho/typecho

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Core Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_core_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Schedule:** Set a recurring calendar reminder (e.g., every two weeks) to check for Typecho updates.
    2.  **Check Official Sources:** Visit the official Typecho website ([https://typecho.org/](https://typecho.org/)) or the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/typecho/typecho](https://github.com/typecho/typecho)). Look for announcements of new releases.
    3.  **Review Release Notes:** Carefully read the release notes for any new version. Pay attention to security fixes, bug fixes, and new features.
    4.  **Backup:** Before *any* update, create a full backup of both the Typecho files (using `tar`, `zip`, or a hosting control panel backup tool) and the database (using `mysqldump` or a similar tool). Store these backups securely.
    5.  **Staging Environment:** Clone the production site to a staging environment (a separate directory or subdomain). This should have the same server configuration as the live site.
    6.  **Update Staging:** Apply the Typecho update to the staging environment first.
    7.  **Thorough Testing:** Test all aspects of the staging site: front-end display, admin panel functionality, plugin compatibility, and any custom features.
    8.  **Update Production (if Staging is Successful):** If the staging environment tests are successful, apply the update to the production site.
    9.  **Monitor Production:** After updating the production site, monitor it closely for any issues. Check server logs and error logs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):** Outdated versions may contain vulnerabilities in the Typecho core that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** Updates often patch XSS vulnerabilities within Typecho's core code.
    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi) (High):** Updates may fix SQL injection flaws in Typecho's database interaction layer.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Older versions might leak sensitive information due to bugs in the core.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):** Some updates address vulnerabilities in the core that could be exploited to cause a denial of service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (assuming timely updates).
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **SQLi:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented (Assumption):** Partially implemented. Typecho has a built-in update notification system in the admin dashboard. However, reliance solely on this is insufficient. Manual checks and a staging environment are likely not consistently used.

*   **Missing Implementation (Assumption):**
    *   Formalized update schedule and documented procedure.
    *   Consistent use of a staging environment for testing updates.
    *   Automated update *notification* (not automatic updates).
    *   Regular review of release notes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration (`config.inc.php`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration___config_inc_php__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Database Credentials:** Use a strong, unique password for the MySQL/MariaDB database user that Typecho uses. This password should *not* be used for any other service.  This is set within `config.inc.php`.
    2.  **Generate a Strong Secret Key:** The `__TYPECHO_SECURE_KEY__` in `config.inc.php` should be a long, random string. You can generate one using a password manager or a command-line tool like `openssl rand -base64 32`.  This key is crucial for Typecho's security.
    3.  **Disable Debug Mode:** Set `__TYPECHO_DEBUG__` to `false` in `config.inc.php` for production environments.  Debug mode can expose sensitive information that Typecho would normally keep hidden.
    4.  **Review Other Settings:** Carefully examine all other settings in `config.inc.php` and ensure they are appropriate for your security needs. Typecho's documentation should be consulted for best practices.
    5. **Restrict File Permissions:** Set the permissions of `config.inc.php` to 600 or 400 (read/write only for the owner, or read-only for the owner). This prevents other users on the server from reading the file. Use `chmod 600 config.inc.php` (or `chmod 400 config.inc.php`) via SSH. *This is a server-level action, but it directly protects Typecho's configuration.*

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Database Compromise (Critical):** Weak database credentials (set in `config.inc.php`) can lead to complete database takeover.
    *   **Session Hijacking (High):** A weak secret key (set in `config.inc.php`) can allow attackers to forge session cookies, bypassing Typecho's authentication.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Debug mode (controlled by `config.inc.php`) can reveal sensitive information about the Typecho installation and server.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access (Medium):** Incorrect file permissions can allow unauthorized users to read or modify the configuration file.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Database Compromise:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Unauthorized File Access:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented (Assumption):** Partially implemented.  Most installations likely have a secret key set, but it might not be sufficiently strong. Debug mode might be accidentally left enabled. File permissions are often overlooked.

*   **Missing Implementation (Assumption):**
    *   Verification of secret key strength.
    *   Consistent disabling of debug mode in production.
    *   Correct file permissions for `config.inc.php`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Admin Panel Path Change](./mitigation_strategies/admin_panel_path_change.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rename `admin` Directory:** Change the name of the `admin` directory to something less predictable (e.g., `my-secret-admin`, `backend2024`, etc.).  This is a direct modification of the Typecho file structure.
    2.  **Update `config.inc.php`:**  Modify the `config.inc.php` file to reflect the new admin directory path.  Specifically, change the `__TYPECHO_ADMIN_DIR__` definition:
        ```php
        define('__TYPECHO_ADMIN_DIR__', '/my-secret-admin/'); // Replace 'my-secret-admin'
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High):** Changing the default admin path makes it harder for attackers to find the Typecho login page, reducing the effectiveness of automated attacks targeting the default path.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium):** While not a complete solution, obscuring the admin path adds a layer of difficulty to brute-force attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low/Medium.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low/Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented (Assumption):** Likely not implemented. Most Typecho installations use the default `/admin/` path.

*   **Missing Implementation (Assumption):**
    *   Renaming the `admin` directory.
    *   Updating the `__TYPECHO_ADMIN_DIR__` constant in `config.inc.php`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comment Moderation (Built-in)](./mitigation_strategies/comment_moderation__built-in_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Typecho Settings:** Log in to the Typecho admin panel.
    2.  **Navigate to Settings > Discussion:** Find the discussion settings section.
    3.  **Enable Comment Moderation:**  Check the box to enable comment moderation.  This setting is a core part of Typecho.  You can choose to moderate all comments or only comments from users who are not logged in.
    4. **Configure Options:** Adjust other comment settings as needed, such as requiring email addresses or enabling anti-spam features (if available through plugins).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium):** Moderation allows manual review of comments, preventing malicious JavaScript from being published.  This supplements Typecho's built-in sanitization.
    *   **Comment Spam (Low):** Moderation helps prevent automated spam bots from posting unwanted content.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Comment Spam:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented (Assumption):** Potentially implemented, but may not be consistently used on all Typecho sites.

*   **Missing Implementation (Assumption):**
    *   Consistent use of comment moderation, especially for sites with high comment volume or those that are frequent targets of spam.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Typecho's CSRF Protection (Built-in)](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_typecho's_csrf_protection__built-in_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1. **Understand Typecho's Mechanism:** Typecho uses hidden tokens in forms to protect against CSRF attacks. These tokens are automatically generated and validated by Typecho's core functions when forms are created using Typecho's helper methods.
    2. **Rely on Core Functions:** When developing custom functionality *within Typecho's core* (which is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary), always use Typecho's built-in form helper functions to ensure CSRF tokens are included and validated.  Avoid manually creating forms without incorporating Typecho's protection.
    3. **No Direct Action (Usually):** For standard Typecho usage, there's usually no direct action required, as the protection is built-in. The key is to *not bypass* it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High):** This is the primary threat mitigated. Typecho's built-in protection, when used correctly, prevents attackers from tricking users into performing unintended actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:** Risk reduced from High to Low (when Typecho's built-in mechanisms are used correctly).

*   **Currently Implemented (Assumption):** Implemented in Typecho's core. The risk comes from bypassing it, not from its absence.

*   **Missing Implementation (Assumption):**
    *   Potential issues could arise if core files are modified directly without using Typecho's API, bypassing the built-in CSRF protection. This is *not* a common scenario for typical Typecho users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [XML-RPC Control via Typecho Plugins or Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/xml-rpc_control_via_typecho_plugins_or_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess XML-RPC Usage:** Determine if your Typecho installation *requires* XML-RPC functionality. If you don't use remote publishing tools (like older blog clients), you likely don't need it.
    2.  **Plugin-Based Disabling (Preferred):** Search for a Typecho plugin specifically designed to disable XML-RPC.  This is the safest and most recommended approach, as it integrates with Typecho's plugin system.
    3.  **`.htaccess` Modification (Alternative):** If a suitable plugin isn't available, you can disable XML-RPC by adding the following to your `.htaccess` file (Apache):
        ```apache
        <Files xmlrpc.php>
            Order Deny,Allow
            Deny from all
        </Files>
        ```
        This is a server-level configuration, but it directly affects Typecho's `xmlrpc.php` file.
    4. **Restrict Access (If Necessary):** If you *must* keep XML-RPC enabled, use `.htaccess` rules (or equivalent in other web servers) to restrict access to specific IP addresses, as shown in previous examples.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium):** XML-RPC can be used for brute-force password guessing against Typecho.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):** XML-RPC can be abused to cause a denial of service on the Typecho site.
    *   **Pingback/Trackback Spam (Low):** XML-RPC is sometimes used for comment spam on Typecho blogs.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):** Although less common, vulnerabilities in XML-RPC implementations can sometimes lead to RCE. Disabling or restricting access mitigates this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Pingback/Trackback Spam:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
    *   **RCE:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (if XML-RPC is disabled or properly secured).

*   **Currently Implemented (Assumption):** Likely not implemented. XML-RPC is often enabled by default in Typecho.

*   **Missing Implementation (Assumption):**
    *   Disabling XML-RPC via a plugin or `.htaccess` if it's not used.
    *   Restricting access to XML-RPC if it is used.
