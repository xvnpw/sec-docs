## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Bypass Authentication via SQLi [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_bypass_authentication_via_sqli__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query that, when executed by the application, bypasses the normal authentication process. This could involve manipulating the `WHERE` clause of a login query to always return a valid user, or injecting a subquery that retrieves administrator credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming Typecho's core authentication is well-written)
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete administrative access)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires understanding of the database schema and SQL injection techniques)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (sophisticated SQLi can be difficult to detect)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2.1 Exploiting `unserialize()` with crafted input [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_1_exploiting__unserialize____with_crafted_input__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** If Typecho or a plugin uses PHP's `unserialize()` function on user-supplied data without proper validation, an attacker can inject a crafted serialized object. This object can contain malicious code that is executed when the object is unserialized, leading to RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low (in core; higher if plugins misuse `unserialize()`)
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete server compromise)
*   **Effort:** High (requires deep understanding of PHP object serialization and vulnerability research)
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (requires static code analysis and dynamic testing)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.3 Vulnerable Plugins/Themes with RCE flaws [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_3_vulnerable_pluginsthemes_with_rce_flaws__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** A third-party plugin or theme contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could be due to insecure file uploads, unsafe use of `eval()`, or other code injection flaws.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the quality and security of installed plugins/themes)
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete server compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (finding and exploiting the vulnerability may require some effort)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (some vulnerabilities may be detected by security scanners, but others require manual code review)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.2.1 Session Hijacking [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_2_1_session_hijacking__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker steals a valid user's session ID and uses it to impersonate that user. This can be achieved through XSS attacks, network sniffing (if HTTPS is not used), or by predicting weak session IDs.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if Typecho uses HTTPS and secure session management)
*   **Impact:** Very High (access to the hijacked user's account, potentially admin)
*   **Effort:** Medium (depends on the attack vector; XSS is easier than network sniffing)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires monitoring session activity and detecting anomalies)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 SQL Injection (SQLi) in Plugins/Themes [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_sql_injection__sqli__in_pluginsthemes__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.1, but the vulnerability exists within a third-party plugin or theme.  The attacker exploits an input field that is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the quality of installed plugins/themes)
*   **Impact:** Very High (database compromise, potentially leading to admin access)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Plugins/Themes [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_pluginsthemes__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** A plugin or theme contains an XSS vulnerability, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the website. This code can then be executed in the browsers of other users, including administrators.  Stored XSS (where the malicious script is saved on the server) is particularly dangerous.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions)
*   **Effort:** Low (XSS vulnerabilities are often easy to find and exploit)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Plugins/Themes [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_remote_code_execution__rce__in_pluginsthemes__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  (Same as 1.3.3 - repeated for emphasis) A third-party plugin or theme contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.4 Authentication Bypass in Plugins/Themes [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_4_authentication_bypass_in_pluginsthemes__critical_.md)

*  **Description:** A plugin introduces its own authentication mechanism that is flawed, allowing an attacker to bypass it and gain unauthorized access, potentially with elevated privileges.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Default Admin Credentials (if not changed during installation) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_default_admin_credentials__if_not_changed_during_installation___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses the default administrator username and password, which were not changed during the initial Typecho installation.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low (assuming users follow basic security practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (immediate administrative access)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (trivial to attempt)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (failed login attempts with default credentials)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Open Installation Directory (`/install.php` accessible after installation) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_open_installation_directory___install_php__accessible_after_installation___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker accesses the `/install.php` file, which should have been removed or disabled after installation.  This file might allow the attacker to reconfigure the application, potentially creating a new administrator account or changing existing settings.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming administrators follow best practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (potential for complete control over the application)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (simply accessing a URL)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (access logs will show requests to `/install.php`)
