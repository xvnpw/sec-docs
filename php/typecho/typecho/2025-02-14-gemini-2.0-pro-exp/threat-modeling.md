# Threat Model Analysis for typecho/typecho

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
*   **Description:** An administrator is tricked into installing a malicious plugin.  This could be through social engineering, a compromised plugin repository, or a disguised plugin. The attacker's plugin contains code to take over the site, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete site takeover.
    *   Database compromise and data exfiltration.
    *   File system access and modification.
    *   Installation of malware or further backdoors.
    *   Use of the server for malicious purposes.
*   **Typecho Component Affected:** Plugin system (`/usr/plugins/` directory, plugin activation/deactivation mechanisms, plugin API hooks).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Plugin Source Control:** *Only* install plugins from the official Typecho plugin repository or highly trusted developers.
    *   **Manual Code Review (Ideal):** Thoroughly review plugin source code before installation (requires PHP expertise).
    *   **Plugin Reputation Check:** Research the plugin and developer extensively.
    *   **Staging Environment:** Test new plugins in an isolated staging environment.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Use a FIM to detect unauthorized changes to plugin files.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Can help block *some* exploits, but is not a primary defense.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (known or zero-day) in a legitimately installed plugin.  This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code or perform other unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** (Same as Malicious Plugin Installation - Complete site takeover, data theft, etc.)
*   **Typecho Component Affected:** The specific vulnerable plugin and potentially any Typecho core functions it interacts with.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High (for other significant compromises).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** *Always* keep all plugins updated to their latest versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security mailing lists and forums.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Conceptual):** Plugin developers should minimize required privileges.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Can help mitigate *some* known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review and remove unnecessary or unmaintained plugins.

## Threat: [Malicious Theme Installation](./threats/malicious_theme_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Theme Installation
*   **Description:** An administrator installs a malicious theme containing harmful code (JavaScript, potentially PHP). This could be used for client-side attacks or defacement.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Client-side attacks (e.g., injecting malicious scripts).
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Potentially, limited server-side compromise.
*   **Typecho Component Affected:** Theme system (`/usr/themes/` directory, theme rendering engine).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Theme Sources:** Only use themes from the official repository or reputable developers.
    *   **Theme Code Review:** Review theme code (especially JavaScript) for suspicious patterns.
    *   **Theme Updates:** Keep themes updated.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict sources from which the theme can load resources.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Theme Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_theme_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Theme Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a legitimately installed theme, most likely a client-side vulnerability (e.g., XSS).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Client-side attacks (e.g., session hijacking, phishing).
    *   Defacement.
*   **Typecho Component Affected:** The specific vulnerable theme and potentially interacting Typecho core functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Themes Updated:** Always keep themes updated.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor for theme-related security advisories.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Mitigates client-side attacks.

## Threat: [Typecho Core Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/typecho_core_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Typecho Core Vulnerability Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Typecho core code (zero-day or unpatched). This gives the attacker full control.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete site takeover.
    *   Database compromise.
    *   File system access.
    *   Full server control.
*   **Typecho Component Affected:** Various core components, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Typecho Updates:** Apply core updates *immediately* upon release.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor official Typecho channels for vulnerability announcements.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Can provide *some* protection against known exploits.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Can help detect malicious activity.
    *   **Regular Backups:** Maintain frequent, off-site backups for recovery.
