# Threat Model Analysis for typecho/typecho

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Post Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_post_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious blog post containing JavaScript or HTML code. When a user views this post, the malicious script executes in their browser due to insufficient sanitization by Typecho.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the blog.

**Affected Component:** Post Editor, Post Rendering Engine

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side input sanitization for post content before storing it in the database.
*   **Developers:** Utilize context-aware output encoding when displaying post content in templates.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Comment Input](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_comment_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into a comment. When other users view the comment section, the script executes in their browsers due to insufficient sanitization by Typecho.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, potentially compromising logged-in users.

**Affected Component:** Comment Submission Module, Comment Rendering Engine

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strict server-side input sanitization for comment content.
*   **Developers:** Utilize context-aware output encoding when displaying comments.

## Threat: [Weak Password Hashing](./threats/weak_password_hashing.md)

**Description:** If Typecho uses a weak or outdated password hashing algorithm, attackers who gain access to the database could more easily crack user passwords.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, including administrative accounts.

**Affected Component:** User Authentication Module

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Ensure the use of strong and modern password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt) with appropriate salting.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management](./threats/insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Typecho manages user sessions (e.g., predictable session IDs, lack of proper session invalidation) could allow attackers to hijack user sessions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts without needing credentials.

**Affected Component:** Session Management Module

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Generate cryptographically secure, unpredictable session IDs.
*   **Developers:** Implement proper session invalidation upon logout or after a period of inactivity.
*   **Developers:** Consider using HTTP-only and Secure flags for session cookies.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Update Process](./threats/insecure_plugin_update_process.md)

**Description:** If the process for updating plugins is not secure within Typecho's core (e.g., lack of integrity checks, insecure transport), an attacker could potentially inject malicious code into a plugin update.

**Impact:** Installation of backdoored or compromised plugins, leading to various security risks.

**Affected Component:** Plugin Update Mechanism

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers (Typecho Core):** Implement secure update mechanisms with integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) and secure transport (HTTPS).

## Threat: [Directory Traversal via File Handling](./threats/directory_traversal_via_file_handling.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Typecho's core handles file paths could allow an attacker to access or manipulate files outside of the intended directories.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive configuration files, potential for reading or modifying arbitrary files on the server.

**Affected Component:** File Handling Functions (within Typecho core)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Avoid directly using user-provided input in file paths within core functionalities.
*   **Developers:** Implement proper path sanitization and validation in core file handling functions.
*   **Developers:** Use absolute paths or restrict file access to specific directories within the core.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** If Typecho's core configuration file handling does not prevent direct access via the webserver, configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials) could be retrieved by attackers.

**Impact:** Database compromise, potential for further exploitation.

**Affected Component:** Configuration File Handling

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Users:** Ensure that configuration files are not accessible via the webserver (e.g., by placing them outside the webroot or using appropriate webserver configurations).
*   **Developers (Typecho Core):**  Ensure that the core framework prevents direct access to configuration files via web requests.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/unrestricted_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** If Typecho's core allows administrators or other privileged users to upload files without proper validation, an attacker could upload a malicious script (e.g., a PHP shell).

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server.

**Affected Component:** File Upload Functionality (within Typecho core)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strict validation of uploaded file types and content within the core file upload functionality.
*   **Developers:** Store uploaded files outside of the webroot or in a location where server-side scripts cannot be executed by default within the core.
*   **Developers:** Rename uploaded files to prevent direct execution within the core.
