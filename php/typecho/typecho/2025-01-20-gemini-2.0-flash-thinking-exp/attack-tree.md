## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (Critical Node & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker manipulates input fields to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database queries.
* **Impact:**
    * Extraction of sensitive data (user credentials, application data).
    * Modification or deletion of data.
    * Potential for arbitrary command execution on the database server (if database user has sufficient privileges).
* **Why High-Risk:** Common web application vulnerability, can have severe consequences, tools and techniques are readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Critical Node & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss___critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the application, which is then executed in the browser of other users (especially administrators).
* **Impact:**
    * Session hijacking (stealing admin session cookies).
    * Performing actions on behalf of the administrator.
    * Redirection to malicious websites (phishing).
    * Defacement of the website.
* **Why High-Risk:** Relatively easy to exploit, especially if input is not properly sanitized, can lead to account takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Deserialization (Critical Node & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_deserialization__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the application handles serialized data, allowing them to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Impact:**
    * Complete control over the web server.
    * Data breaches.
    * Installation of malware.
    * Service disruption.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Directly leads to system compromise, although identifying and exploiting these vulnerabilities can require advanced skills.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass (Critical Node & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker exploits flaws in the login mechanism to gain access without providing valid credentials.
* **Impact:**
    * Immediate unauthorized access to the application, potentially with administrative privileges.
    * Full control over the application and its data.
* **Why High-Risk:** Grants immediate and significant access, bypassing security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unrestricted File Upload (Critical Node & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/unrestricted_file_upload__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., PHP shells) to the server due to insufficient validation.
* **Impact:**
    * Execution of arbitrary code on the server.
    * Web shell access, allowing further exploitation.
    * Data breaches.
* **Why High-Risk:** A common and easily exploitable vulnerability if upload functionality is not properly secured, leading to direct system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Theme/Plugin Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_themeplugin_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker targets vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, RCE, LFI, etc.) present in third-party themes or plugins installed on the Typecho application.
* **Impact:**
    * Similar impacts to core vulnerabilities (data breaches, RCE, account takeover).
    * Compromise of the application through vulnerable extensions.
* **Why High-Risk:** Themes and plugins are often less scrutinized than core code, making them a common attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Credentials (Critical Node & Part of High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_credentials__critical_node_&_part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attacker attempts to log in using default administrative credentials that were not changed during installation.
* **Impact:**
    * Immediate administrative access to the application.
    * Full control over the application and its data.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Trivial to exploit if default credentials are not changed, representing a significant security oversight.
