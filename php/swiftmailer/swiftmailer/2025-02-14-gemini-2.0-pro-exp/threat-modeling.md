# Threat Model Analysis for swiftmailer/swiftmailer

## Threat: [Email Header Injection](./threats/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Email Header Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious email headers (e.g., `Bcc`, `Cc`, `Reply-To`, custom headers) by inserting newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) followed by the malicious header string. This leverages Swiftmailer's handling of headers *if* the application passes unsanitized data to the relevant methods. The vulnerability lies in how Swiftmailer processes strings passed to its header-setting functions; it doesn't inherently prevent injection if the *application* provides malicious input.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information sent to unauthorized recipients via `Bcc` or `Cc`.
        *   **Spam/Phishing:**  Use of the application to send spam or phishing emails.
        *   **Reputation Damage:**  The application's sending IP address or domain could be blacklisted.
        *   **Bypass Security Controls:**  Manipulating `Reply-To` could redirect responses to the attacker.
    *   **Swiftmailer Component Affected:**  `Swift_Message::setHeaders()`, `Swift_Message::add*Header()` methods (e.g., `addCc()`, `addBcc()`, `addReplyTo()`). These methods are vulnerable *if* the application doesn't properly sanitize the input passed to them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Use User Input for Headers Directly:**  Do *not* allow user input to directly populate any email header. This is crucial.
        *   **Use Dedicated Methods:**  Use Swiftmailer's dedicated methods (e.g., `setTo()`, `setCc()`, `setBcc()`, `setReplyTo()`) to set headers.
        *   **Input Validation (Application-Level, but Essential):**  Rigorously validate any data used as input to these methods.  *Reject* any input containing newline characters (`\r`, `\n`). This is the primary defense, and it's an *application* responsibility, but it directly impacts the security of Swiftmailer's functions.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Headers:** If custom headers are necessary, maintain a whitelist of allowed header names and values.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (within Swiftmailer itself)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__within_swiftmailer_itself_.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities (within Swiftmailer itself)

    *   **Description:** Swiftmailer itself, or the libraries it directly depends on *internally*, may contain vulnerabilities. These are not vulnerabilities in *how* the application uses Swiftmailer, but flaws within the Swiftmailer codebase itself.
    *   **Impact:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution *within the context of the application using Swiftmailer*.
    *   **Swiftmailer Component Affected:** The entire Swiftmailer library and any of its *internal* dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical, depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Swiftmailer Updated:** Regularly update Swiftmailer to the latest stable version. This is the *primary* mitigation for this threat.
        *   **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow security news related to Swiftmailer.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (e.g., Composer) to track and update Swiftmailer itself. Composer will handle updating Swiftmailer's *internal* dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools that can identify known vulnerabilities in libraries like Swiftmailer.
