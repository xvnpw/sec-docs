# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftmailer/swiftmailer

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious email headers due to unsanitized user input passed to Swiftmailer's header-setting functions.
    *   **Swiftmailer Contribution:** Swiftmailer's core functionality of setting email headers is the direct mechanism of the attack if misused.
    *   **Example:** A contact form uses user input for the "Subject" field without sanitization. An attacker enters `My Subject\r\nBcc: attacker@evil.com`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Email spoofing (forging the sender).
        *   BCC/CC manipulation (secretly adding recipients).
        *   Reply-To redirection.
        *   Spam distribution.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* user-supplied data used in *any* email header. Use whitelisting whenever possible.
        *   **Use Swiftmailer's API:** *Always* use Swiftmailer's built-in methods (e.g., `setTo()`, `setFrom()`, `setSubject()`, `addPart()`) to set header values.  These methods are designed to handle encoding and sanitization. *Never* manually construct header strings.
        *   **Sanitization:** If direct user input in a header is unavoidable (strongly discouraged), sanitize it thoroughly, removing newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) and other dangerous characters.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (via Attachments)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__via_attachments_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths used for attachments, leveraging Swiftmailer's attachment handling to access arbitrary files.
    *   **Swiftmailer Contribution:** Swiftmailer's `attach()` or `attachFromPath()` methods are directly involved, but the vulnerability stems from the application insecurely constructing the file path passed to these methods.
    *   **Example:** The application constructs the attachment path like this: `$mailer->attachFromPath('/uploads/' . $_POST['filename']);`. An attacker submits `filename=../../etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Reading sensitive files from the server (configuration files, passwords).
        *   Potential for code execution (if a readable file can be executed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Use User Input Directly in File Paths:** *Never* construct file paths directly from user input.
        *   **Sanitize File Names:** Thoroughly sanitize file names to remove directory traversal sequences (`../`, `..\`, etc.). Use functions like `basename()` to extract only the file name.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Paths:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed directories for attachments.
        *   **Secure File Storage:** Store attachments outside the web root with restricted permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Transport-Level Attacks (SMTP - Lack of TLS)](./attack_surfaces/transport-level_attacks__smtp_-_lack_of_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of unencrypted SMTP connections, allowing interception and modification of email traffic.
    *   **Swiftmailer Contribution:** Swiftmailer's SMTP transport is directly involved. The vulnerability is the *lack* of TLS encryption in the configuration.
    *   **Example:** The application configures Swiftmailer to use SMTP without enabling TLS (either SMTPS or STARTTLS).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
        *   Interception of email content (including sensitive data).
        *   Credential theft (if SMTP authentication is used without TLS).
        *   Email modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always Use TLS:** *Mandatory* to use SMTP with TLS encryption (SMTPS or STARTTLS). This is a fundamental security requirement for email.
        *   **Verify Server Certificates:** Configure Swiftmailer to verify the SMTP server's TLS certificate to prevent MitM attacks with forged certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Sendmail Command Injection (Less Common, but Critical)](./attack_surfaces/sendmail_command_injection__less_common__but_critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of arbitrary commands into the Sendmail command used by Swiftmailer (if the Sendmail transport is used and *very* poorly configured).
    *   **Swiftmailer Contribution:** Swiftmailer's Sendmail transport is the direct attack vector. The vulnerability arises from the application unsafely constructing the Sendmail command string.
    *   **Example:** The application constructs the Sendmail command with user input: `$mailer->setCommand('/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i ' . $_POST['options']);`. An attacker submits `options=; cat /etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary command execution on the server.
        *   Complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Sendmail Transport if Possible:** Strongly prefer SMTP with TLS.
        *   **If Sendmail is Absolutely Necessary, Sanitize Extremely Carefully:** If Sendmail *must* be used, *never* include user input directly in the command string. Use Swiftmailer's API to configure Sendmail options. If user data *must* be incorporated, sanitize it with extreme prejudice, using whitelisting and escaping. This is a very high-risk scenario.
