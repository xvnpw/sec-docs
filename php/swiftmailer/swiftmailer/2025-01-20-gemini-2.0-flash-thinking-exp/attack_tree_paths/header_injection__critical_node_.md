### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Header Injection

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability

Header Injection vulnerabilities arise when an application allows user-controlled data to be directly incorporated into email headers without proper sanitization or validation. Email headers are structured using a specific format: `Header-Name: Header-Value\r\n`. The crucial elements here are the Carriage Return (`\r`) and Line Feed (`\n`) characters, which denote the end of a header.

Attackers exploit this by injecting these control characters into input fields that are used to construct email headers. By inserting `\r\n`, they can effectively terminate the current header and start a new one. This allows them to inject arbitrary headers, potentially overriding existing ones or adding entirely new ones.

#### 4.2 SwiftMailer Context

SwiftMailer provides various methods for setting email headers, including:

* **Standard recipient headers:** `setTo()`, `setCc()`, `setBcc()`
* **Sender information:** `setFrom()`, `setReplyTo()`
* **Subject:** `setSubject()`
* **Custom headers:** `getHeaders()->addTextHeader()`, `getHeaders()->addIdHeader()`, etc.

The vulnerability arises when the application using SwiftMailer takes user input and directly passes it to these methods without proper validation. For example, if a website has a "Send to a Friend" feature and takes the recipient's email address from a form, an attacker could inject malicious headers within this input.

#### 4.3 Attack Vectors

Here are some common attack vectors for Header Injection in the context of SwiftMailer:

* **Manipulating Recipient Fields:**
    * An attacker could inject `\r\nBcc: attacker@example.com` into the `To`, `Cc`, or `Bcc` fields. This would silently add the attacker as a recipient, allowing them to intercept emails.
* **Injecting `From` or `Reply-To` Headers:**
    * By injecting `\r\nFrom: malicious@example.com`, an attacker can spoof the sender's address, making the email appear to originate from a trusted source for phishing attacks.
    * Similarly, injecting `\r\nReply-To: malicious@example.com` can redirect replies to the attacker.
* **Adding Arbitrary Headers:**
    * Attackers can inject various malicious headers, such as:
        * `\r\nContent-Type: text/html`:  Forcing the email client to render the body as HTML, potentially bypassing spam filters or enabling malicious scripts.
        * `\r\nX-Custom-Header: Malicious Value`: While less directly impactful, this could be used for reconnaissance or to exploit vulnerabilities in email processing systems.
        * `\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64`:  Potentially used to obfuscate malicious content within the email body.
* **Exploiting Custom Header Functionality:**
    * If the application uses `addCustomHeader()` with unsanitized user input, attackers can inject any arbitrary header.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a contact form where the user provides their email address. The application uses this input to set the `Reply-To` header in the confirmation email sent from the system.

```php
$mailer = new Swift_Mailer($transport);
$message = (new Swift_Message('Confirmation Email'))
  ->setFrom(['noreply@example.com' => 'Example System'])
  ->setTo([$_POST['user_email'] => 'User Name']) // Assuming user_email is sanitized
  ->setBody('Thank you for contacting us!');

// Vulnerable code: Directly using user input for Reply-To
$message->setReplyTo($_POST['user_email']);

$mailer->send($message);
```

An attacker could input the following in the `user_email` field:

```
victim@example.com\r\nBcc: attacker@example.com
```

This would result in the following headers being generated:

```
From: noreply@example.com
To: victim@example.com
Reply-To: victim@example.com
Bcc: attacker@example.com
Subject: Confirmation Email
...
```

The attacker would receive a copy of the confirmation email.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

A successful Header Injection attack can have significant consequences:

* **Email Routing Control:** Attackers can redirect emails to unintended recipients (e.g., themselves) by injecting `Bcc` or manipulating other routing headers.
* **Bypassing Security Measures:**
    * **SPF/DKIM/DMARC Bypass:** By forging the `From` address, attackers can send emails that appear to originate from legitimate domains, potentially bypassing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks.
    * **Spam Filter Evasion:** Injecting specific headers or manipulating content types can sometimes help bypass spam filters.
* **Phishing Attacks:**  Spoofing the `From` address and crafting convincing email content allows attackers to conduct more effective phishing campaigns.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Intercepting emails intended for other recipients can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
* **Reputation Damage:**  If an application is used to send malicious emails, it can damage the sender's reputation and lead to blacklisting of their email servers.
* **Code Injection (Less Common):** In some edge cases, if the injected headers are processed by vulnerable email clients or servers, it might be possible to inject code.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate Header Injection vulnerabilities in applications using SwiftMailer, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Sanitization:**  **This is the most crucial step.**  All user-provided input that is used to construct email headers must be rigorously sanitized. This involves:
    * **Removing or Encoding CRLF Characters:**  Strip out or encode carriage return (`\r`) and line feed (`\n`) characters before using the input in header values. PHP's `str_replace()` or regular expressions can be used for this.
    * **Whitelisting Allowed Characters:**  If possible, restrict input to a specific set of allowed characters.
* **Header Validation:**  Implement validation checks on user-provided input before using it in headers. This can include:
    * **Regular Expression Matching:**  Validate email addresses and other header values against expected patterns.
    * **Length Restrictions:**  Limit the length of header values to prevent excessively long or malformed headers.
* **Leverage SwiftMailer's Built-in Security Features (if any):**  Consult SwiftMailer's documentation for any built-in functions or configurations that help prevent header injection. While SwiftMailer itself doesn't inherently prevent this (as it relies on the application to provide safe input), understanding its header handling mechanisms is important.
* **Use Secure Header Setting Methods:**  Prefer using SwiftMailer's dedicated methods for setting standard headers (`setTo`, `setFrom`, etc.) rather than directly manipulating the headers object with unsanitized input.
* **Implement Security Headers:**  While not directly preventing header injection, implementing security-related email headers like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC can help mitigate the impact of spoofed emails.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on email sending to prevent attackers from sending a large number of malicious emails quickly.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep SwiftMailer and the underlying PHP installation up-to-date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including header injection.

#### 4.6 Code Example (Illustrative - Mitigation):

```php
$mailer = new Swift_Mailer($transport);
$message = (new Swift_Message('Confirmation Email'))
  ->setFrom(['noreply@example.com' => 'Example System'])
  ->setTo([$_POST['user_email'] => 'User Name']) // Assuming user_email is sanitized
  ->setBody('Thank you for contacting us!');

// Mitigated code: Sanitizing user input for Reply-To
$replyToEmail = str_replace(array("\r", "\n"), '', $_POST['user_email']);
$message->setReplyTo($replyToEmail);

$mailer->send($message);
```

In this example, `str_replace()` is used to remove carriage return and line feed characters from the user-provided email address before setting the `Reply-To` header.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Header Injection" vulnerability is a critical security concern in applications using SwiftMailer. By carefully crafting input, attackers can manipulate email headers to achieve various malicious goals, including intercepting emails, conducting phishing attacks, and bypassing security measures.

Effective mitigation relies heavily on robust input sanitization and validation of all user-provided data that is used to construct email headers. Developers must be vigilant in preventing the injection of control characters like `\r` and `\n`. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies will significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability being exploited. Regular security assessments and staying updated with the latest security best practices are crucial for maintaining the security of applications that handle email.
