# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftmailer/swiftmailer

## Attack Surface: [Exposed SMTP Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposed_smtp_credentials.md)

- **Description:** Sensitive SMTP server credentials (username, password) are accessible to unauthorized individuals.
- **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer requires SMTP credentials to send emails. If these are stored insecurely, the library becomes a vector for their exposure.
- **Example:** Hardcoding SMTP credentials directly in the application's PHP code or storing them in a plain text configuration file accessible via a web vulnerability.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the SMTP server, allowing attackers to send emails on behalf of the application, potentially for spamming, phishing, or other malicious activities.
- **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the code.
    - Utilize environment variables to store sensitive configuration.
    - Employ secure configuration management tools or vaults.
    - Encrypt configuration files containing credentials.
    - Implement proper access controls to configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Email Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/email_header_injection.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary email headers by manipulating user-provided input that is used to construct email headers.
- **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer uses provided data (e.g., `To`, `Cc`, `Bcc`, `Subject`, `From`) to build email headers. If this input is not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious headers.
- **Example:** A contact form where the user-provided email address is directly used in the `From` header without validation, allowing an attacker to inject additional headers like `Bcc: attacker@example.com` to receive copies of all emails.
- **Impact:** Spoofing sender addresses, adding unintended recipients, manipulating email routing, bypassing spam filters, and potentially executing code on the recipient's email client (in rare cases).
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Sanitize and validate all user-provided input used in email headers.
    - Use SwiftMailer's built-in methods for setting headers, which often provide some level of protection.
    - Avoid directly concatenating user input into header strings.
    - Implement strict input validation rules for email addresses and other header fields.

## Attack Surface: [Email Body Injection (HTML/Plain Text)](./attack_surfaces/email_body_injection__htmlplain_text_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious content into the email body by manipulating user-provided input.
- **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer renders the email body based on the provided content. If this content is not sanitized, attackers can inject malicious HTML or plain text.
- **Example:** A forum notification system where user-generated content is included in the email body without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that could execute in the recipient's email client (if HTML emails are enabled).
- **Impact:** Phishing attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) within email clients, distribution of malware links, and social engineering attacks.
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Sanitize and escape all user-provided input used in the email body.
    - Use appropriate escaping functions based on the email format (HTML or plain text).
    - Consider using a templating engine with auto-escaping features.
    - Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for HTML emails (if applicable and supported by email clients).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure SMTP Configuration (No TLS/SSL)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_smtp_configuration__no_tlsssl_.md)

- **Description:** The connection between the application and the SMTP server is not encrypted.
- **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer allows configuring the transport protocol for sending emails. If TLS/SSL is not enforced, communication is vulnerable.
- **Example:** Configuring SwiftMailer to use `smtp` without specifying `tls` or `ssl` options, sending email data in plain text over the network.
- **Impact:** Interception of email content and SMTP credentials in transit, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information or the SMTP server itself.
- **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Always enforce TLS/SSL encryption for SMTP connections.
    - Configure SwiftMailer to use `smtps` or explicitly set the `encryption` option to `tls` or `ssl`.
    - Verify the SMTP server's certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Attachment Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_attachment_uploads.md)

- **Description:** The application allows users to upload arbitrary files as email attachments without proper validation.
- **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer facilitates the inclusion of attachments in emails. If the application doesn't validate attachments before passing them to SwiftMailer, malicious files can be sent.
- **Example:** A file sharing feature where users can attach any file type to an email, allowing an attacker to upload and send malware-laden attachments.
- **Impact:** Distribution of malware, phishing attacks using malicious attachments, and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in the recipient's system when opening the attachment.
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict validation of uploaded files, including file type, size, and content.
    - Use allow-lists for permitted file types instead of deny-lists.
    - Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software.
    - Rename uploaded files to prevent execution vulnerabilities based on filename extensions.

## Attack Surface: [SMTP Relay Abuse (Misconfigured Server)](./attack_surfaces/smtp_relay_abuse__misconfigured_server_.md)

- **Description:** The application's SMTP configuration allows it to be used as an open relay to send emails to arbitrary recipients.
- **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** If the SMTP server configured in SwiftMailer is not properly secured, attackers can leverage the application to send spam or phishing emails.
- **Example:** Configuring SwiftMailer to connect to an SMTP server that does not require authentication or has weak authentication, allowing anyone with access to the application to send emails through it.
- **Impact:** The application's IP address could be blacklisted, leading to deliverability issues for legitimate emails. The application could be used for malicious purposes, damaging its reputation.
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure the configured SMTP server requires strong authentication.
    - Restrict the ability to send emails to authorized users or specific recipients.
    - Monitor email sending activity for suspicious patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SwiftMailer Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_swiftmailer_library_itself.md)

- **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the SwiftMailer library code.
- **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** The application directly uses the SwiftMailer library, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in its code.
- **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of SwiftMailer that allows for remote code execution if a specially crafted email is processed.
- **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
- **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if RCE), **High** (for other significant vulnerabilities)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep the SwiftMailer library updated to the latest stable version.
    - Subscribe to security advisories and patch promptly when vulnerabilities are announced.
    - Regularly review the project's changelog and security announcements.
