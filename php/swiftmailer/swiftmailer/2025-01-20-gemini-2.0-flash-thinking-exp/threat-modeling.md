# Threat Model Analysis for swiftmailer/swiftmailer

## Threat: [Email Header Injection](./threats/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input that is directly used to construct email headers by SwiftMailer. They might inject additional headers to send emails to unintended recipients, spoof the sender address, or inject malicious content. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization within SwiftMailer's header handling.
    *   **Impact:** Sending emails to unauthorized recipients, sender spoofing leading to phishing or reputational damage, bypassing spam filters, potential for delivering malicious content.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Swift_Mime_SimpleHeaderSet`, specifically when adding headers using methods that don't properly sanitize input or when directly manipulating the header string. Also affects `Swift_Message` when setting headers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly use user input in raw email headers.**
        *   Utilize SwiftMailer's provided methods for setting headers (e.g., `setTo()`, `setCc()`, `setSubject()`) which handle some basic sanitization.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data *before* passing it to SwiftMailer's header methods.
        *   Consider using a dedicated email templating engine that helps separate data from the email structure.

## Threat: [Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities](./threats/attachment_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how SwiftMailer handles file attachments. This could involve issues with filename sanitization, content-type detection, or other aspects of attachment processing that could lead to security issues on the recipient's end.
    *   **Impact:** Distribution of malware, potential compromise of recipient systems, data breaches if malicious attachments are designed to exfiltrate data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Swift_Message::attach()`, `Swift_Attachment`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation on the server-side based on file content (magic numbers), not just the file extension, *before* attaching files using SwiftMailer.
        *   Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software before sending them as attachments with SwiftMailer.
        *   Limit the size and number of attachments allowed.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SwiftMailer Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_swiftmailer_library.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability within the SwiftMailer library itself. This could be a bug in the code that allows for remote code execution, information disclosure, or other malicious activities directly through the SwiftMailer library.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to complete compromise of the application server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability within the SwiftMailer codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SwiftMailer updated to the latest stable version.**
        *   Monitor security advisories and patch releases for SwiftMailer.
        *   Subscribe to security mailing lists or use tools that track known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SwiftMailer's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_swiftmailer's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability in one of the libraries that SwiftMailer directly depends on. This vulnerability within a dependency can be leveraged through SwiftMailer's usage of that dependency.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. Could lead to various security issues exploitable through SwiftMailer.
    *   **Affected Component:** The vulnerable dependency as used by SwiftMailer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SwiftMailer and its dependencies updated.**
        *   Use dependency management tools (e.g., Composer) that can identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Regularly audit the application's dependencies.
