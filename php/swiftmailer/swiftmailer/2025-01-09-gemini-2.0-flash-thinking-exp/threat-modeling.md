# Threat Model Analysis for swiftmailer/swiftmailer

## Threat: [Email Header Injection](./threats/email_header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary email headers by including newline characters (`\r\n`) within user-supplied input that is used to construct email headers (e.g., `To`, `Cc`, `Bcc`, `From`, `Reply-To`). This allows the attacker to add their own headers, potentially adding recipients, spoofing the sender, or injecting malicious content.

**Impact:**
*   Sending emails to unintended recipients (including spammers or malicious actors).
*   Spoofing the sender address, making the email appear to come from a trusted source for phishing or social engineering attacks.
*   Injecting `Bcc` headers to secretly send copies of emails to the attacker.
*   Circumventing email security measures like SPF or DKIM.

**Affected Component:** `Swift_Mime_SimpleHeaderSet`, `Swift_Mime_SimpleMessage` (specifically how headers are built from input).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided data that is used in email headers.
*   Use SwiftMailer's built-in methods for setting headers, which often provide encoding and validation (e.g., `$message->setTo()`, `$message->setFrom()`, etc.).
*   Avoid directly concatenating user input into header strings.

## Threat: [Attachment Manipulation/Injection](./threats/attachment_manipulationinjection.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify filenames or content for attachments, an attacker might be able to manipulate these to send malicious files or files with misleading names.

**Impact:**
*   Distributing malware disguised as legitimate files.
*   Exfiltrating data by attaching sensitive files with deceptive names.
*   Overwriting intended attachments with malicious ones.

**Affected Component:** `Swift_Message::attach()`, `Swift_Attachment`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   If accepting file uploads for attachments, implement robust file upload security measures (antivirus scanning, content type validation, etc.) *before* passing them to SwiftMailer.
*   Validate and sanitize filenames provided by users.
*   Store attachments securely on the server and only reference them by a secure identifier. Avoid directly using user-provided paths.

## Threat: [Insecure SMTP Transport](./threats/insecure_smtp_transport.md)

**Description:** Configuring SwiftMailer to use plain SMTP (without TLS/SSL) transmits email content and SMTP credentials in plain text over the network. An attacker eavesdropping on the network can capture this sensitive information.

**Impact:**
*   Disclosure of email content, potentially including sensitive personal or business information.
*   Exposure of SMTP credentials, allowing the attacker to send emails through the configured SMTP server, potentially for spam or phishing.

**Affected Component:** `Swift_SmtpTransport`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always configure SwiftMailer to use secure transport protocols like STARTTLS or explicit SSL/TLS (e.g., using the `ssl` or `tls` options in the transport configuration).
*   Ensure the SMTP server itself is properly configured to support and enforce secure connections.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** SwiftMailer relies on other PHP libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited if not kept up-to-date.

**Impact:**
*   Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from remote code execution to information disclosure.

**Affected Component:**  Dependencies managed by Composer (e.g., `symfony/mime`).

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update SwiftMailer and its dependencies using a dependency management tool like Composer.
*   Monitor security advisories for SwiftMailer and its dependencies.
*   Use tools like `composer audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Threat: [Template Injection (if using templating with SwiftMailer)](./threats/template_injection__if_using_templating_with_swiftmailer_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses a templating engine (like Twig or similar) to generate email content and user input is directly embedded within the template without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker might inject malicious template code.

**Impact:**
*   Arbitrary code execution on the server (depending on the templating engine's capabilities and configuration).
*   Information disclosure by accessing server-side variables or configurations.

**Affected Component:**  Integration between the application's templating engine and how it's used to generate email content for SwiftMailer.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat user input as untrusted when used in email templates.
*   Use secure templating practices, such as escaping output by default and avoiding the direct inclusion of raw user input in template logic.
*   Consider using a templating engine with auto-escaping enabled.
