## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Email Content Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_email_content_manipulation__high_risk_path_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Email Content Manipulation -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Email Body**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages insufficient input sanitization in the application when composing HTML emails. User-supplied data, if not properly escaped or sanitized, can be used to inject malicious JavaScript code into the email body.
*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious JavaScript in HTML Email Body:**  The successful injection of malicious JavaScript is the critical point. When the recipient opens the email in a vulnerable email client, this JavaScript can execute.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to various attacks, including:
    *   **Credential Theft:** The injected JavaScript can steal the recipient's email credentials or other sensitive information if they interact with the malicious content within their email client.
    *   **Further Attacks:**  The attacker can potentially use the compromised email account to send further phishing emails or gain access to other connected services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Attachments [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_attachments__high_risk_path_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Malicious Attachments -> Attach Executable Files**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application allows users to attach files to emails without proper restrictions on file types. An attacker can attach an executable file (e.g., a `.exe` or `.bat` file) disguised as a legitimate document or file.
*   **Critical Node: Leverage Application's Lack of Attachment Type Restrictions:** The absence of proper file type validation is the critical vulnerability that enables this attack.
*   **Impact:** If the recipient is tricked into downloading and executing the malicious attachment, it can lead to:
    *   **Malware Infection:** The executable file can install malware on the recipient's system, potentially giving the attacker remote access or control.
    *   **System Compromise:** If the recipient is an administrator, their system compromise could lead to the compromise of the application server itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attach Executable Files [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/attach_executable_files__high_risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing via Crafted Email Content [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_via_crafted_email_content__high_risk_path_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Phishing via Crafted Email Content -> Spoof Legitimate Sender Addresses**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the application's ability to set or manipulate the sender address in emails. If the application doesn't properly validate or restrict the sender address, an attacker can set it to appear as if the email is coming from a legitimate source (e.g., a company employee or a trusted organization).
*   **Critical Node: Leverage Insecure Application Configuration Allowing Sender Header Manipulation:** The critical point is the application's insecure configuration or lack of proper sanitization for the sender address, allowing manipulation.
*   **Impact:**  Spoofing sender addresses is a key technique in phishing attacks. This can lead to:
    *   **Credential Theft:** Recipients are more likely to trust emails from seemingly legitimate sources and may be tricked into clicking malicious links or providing sensitive information.
    *   **Financial Loss:**  Phishing emails can be used to trick recipients into making fraudulent payments or transferring funds.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Email Header Manipulation -> Header Injection Attacks**

*   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input that is used to construct email headers. An attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the email by including special characters (like newline characters `%0a` or `%0d`) in the input.
*   **Critical Node: Header Injection Attacks:** The ability to inject arbitrary headers is the critical vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** This allows attackers to:
    *   **Inject Additional Headers (e.g., BCC, CC):**  Silently add recipients to emails, potentially leaking sensitive information.
    *   **Modify Existing Headers (e.g., From, Reply-To):** Spoof the sender address for phishing attacks or control where replies are sent.
    *   **Inject Malicious Headers (e.g., Content-Type):**  Potentially bypass spam filters or trigger vulnerabilities in email clients.
