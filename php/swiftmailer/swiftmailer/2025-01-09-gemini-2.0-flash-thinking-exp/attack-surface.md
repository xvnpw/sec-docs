# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftmailer/swiftmailer

## Attack Surface: [Email Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary email headers by manipulating user-provided input that is directly used to set email headers.
    *   **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer provides functions to set email headers. If the application doesn't sanitize or validate user input before passing it to these functions (e.g., `->addHeader()`, `->setFrom()`, `->setTo()`), it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A contact form where the user-provided email address is directly used in the `From` header without validation. An attacker could input `attacker@example.com\nBcc: victim@example.com` to send a hidden copy of the email to themselves.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Email Spoofing
        *   Information Disclosure
        *   Email Redirection
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate user input before using it to set email headers.
        *   Utilize SwiftMailer's built-in methods like `setFrom()`, `setTo()`, etc., with properly validated and trusted data.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/attachment_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate user-provided input related to attachment file paths to access or attach arbitrary files from the server's file system.
    *   **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer's `attach()` method can take a file path as input. If the application constructs this path using unvalidated user input, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to "attach a document" by specifying a filename. An attacker could input `../../../../etc/passwd` as the filename, potentially attaching the server's password file to the email.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure
        *   Data Breach
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid user-provided file paths for attachments.
        *   Use file identifiers and secure storage.
        *   Validate and sanitize input if absolutely necessary for file selection.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed SMTP Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposed_smtp_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** SMTP server credentials (username, password) are stored insecurely, making them accessible to attackers.
    *   **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer requires SMTP credentials to connect to the mail server. If these credentials are hardcoded in the application code or stored in plain text configuration files, attackers gaining access to the codebase can easily obtain them.
    *   **Example:** SMTP credentials are directly written in a PHP file: `$transport = (new Swift_SmtpTransport('smtp.example.com', 587, 'tls'))->setUsername('user')->setPassword('password');`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Email Sending
        *   Reputation Damage
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store SMTP credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management.
        *   Use dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions.
        *   Regularly rotate credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Transport Configuration (Lack of TLS/SSL)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_transport_configuration__lack_of_tlsssl_.md)

*   **Description:** The application is configured to communicate with the SMTP server without encryption (TLS/SSL) or with outdated/vulnerable TLS versions.
    *   **How SwiftMailer Contributes:** SwiftMailer allows configuring the transport protocol (e.g., `tls`, `ssl`). If not configured correctly or if outdated protocols are used, the communication is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**  Using `Swift_SmtpTransport` without specifying `tls` or `ssl`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
        *   Data Breach
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always configure SwiftMailer to use secure transport protocols (`tls` or `ssl`).
        *   Specify a minimum TLS version.
        *   Ensure certificate verification is enabled.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of the SwiftMailer library that contains known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How SwiftMailer Contributes:**  Using an outdated version of SwiftMailer exposes the application to known security flaws within the library's code.
    *   **Example:** Using a version of SwiftMailer vulnerable to a known header injection flaw.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, potentially Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SwiftMailer updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Composer) to manage updates.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans.
