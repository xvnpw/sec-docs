# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, SwiftMailer, is a PHP library designed to provide a simple and feature-rich way to send emails from PHP applications. It aims to abstract the complexities of email protocols and server interactions, allowing developers to easily integrate email functionality into their projects.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a reliable and easy-to-use PHP library for sending emails.
  - Support various email sending methods and protocols (SMTP, Sendmail, etc.).
  - Ensure compatibility with different PHP versions and environments.
  - Maintain a stable and well-documented library for the PHP community.
  - Facilitate efficient and secure email delivery for applications.

- Business Risks:
  - Email Delivery Failure: If SwiftMailer fails to send emails reliably, critical business processes that depend on email communication (e.g., password resets, order confirmations, notifications) could be disrupted.
  - Security Vulnerabilities: Security flaws in SwiftMailer could be exploited to send unauthorized emails, inject malicious content into emails, or gain access to sensitive information if email sending is mishandled.
  - Reputation Damage: If SwiftMailer is used to send spam or phishing emails due to vulnerabilities or misconfiguration, it could damage the reputation of the applications using it and potentially SwiftMailer itself.
  - Data Breaches: If email content or SMTP credentials are exposed due to vulnerabilities, sensitive data could be compromised.
  - Dependency Risk: As a library, SwiftMailer introduces a dependency. Vulnerabilities in SwiftMailer or its dependencies could impact applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation is likely implemented within SwiftMailer to sanitize email addresses, headers, and body content to prevent injection attacks. (Implementation details are within the SwiftMailer codebase).
  - security control: Support for TLS/SSL encryption for SMTP connections to ensure secure communication with mail servers. (Configurable within SwiftMailer when setting up SMTP transport).
  - security control: Open source nature allows for community review and scrutiny of the code, potentially leading to faster identification and resolution of security vulnerabilities. (GitHub repository: https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying PHP runtime environment. Vulnerabilities in PHP itself could indirectly affect SwiftMailer.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies if SwiftMailer relies on any external libraries (needs to be verified by inspecting project dependencies).
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration by developers using SwiftMailer. Incorrectly configured SMTP settings or insecure coding practices in applications using SwiftMailer can introduce vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in the development pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in SwiftMailer code.
  - security control: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning to detect and manage vulnerabilities in any third-party libraries used by SwiftMailer.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews by security experts to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.
  - security control: Provide clear and comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for developers using SwiftMailer, focusing on secure configuration and usage.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support for various SMTP authentication mechanisms (e.g., PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, NTLM) to securely authenticate with SMTP servers.
    - Requirement: Secure handling and storage of SMTP credentials. SwiftMailer should not store credentials in plaintext in logs or configuration files if possible. Applications using SwiftMailer are responsible for secure credential management.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: While SwiftMailer itself doesn't handle authorization, applications using it must implement proper authorization controls to ensure only authorized users or processes can send emails.
    - Requirement: Applications should restrict the ability to configure email sending parameters (sender address, recipient addresses, etc.) to authorized users or roles.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Robust input validation for all email components, including recipient addresses, sender addresses, subject, headers, and body, to prevent injection attacks (e.g., header injection, email body injection).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied on both the client-side (application using SwiftMailer) and within the SwiftMailer library itself.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Mandatory support for TLS/SSL encryption for SMTP connections to protect the confidentiality and integrity of email communication during transit.
    - Requirement: Consider support for email signing technologies like DKIM and S/MIME to enhance email authenticity and integrity (depending on project goals and user demand).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For SwiftMailer library itself: Ensuring the library is available, functional, and secure for developers to use in their applications. Maintaining the reputation and trust in the library within the PHP community.
  - For applications using SwiftMailer: Email communication is often critical for various business processes such as:
    - Transactional emails (order confirmations, password resets, account verification).
    - Notifications and alerts.
    - Marketing and communication campaigns.
    - Customer support and communication.
    Disruption or compromise of email sending can directly impact these processes.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - SwiftMailer library code itself: Source code is publicly available, but protecting against unauthorized modifications to the repository is important for maintaining integrity.
  - Email Content: Emails sent using SwiftMailer can contain sensitive data, including:
    - Personal Identifiable Information (PII) of users (names, email addresses, etc.).
    - Transactional data (order details, financial information).
    - Confidential business communications.
    Sensitivity of email data varies depending on the application and the content of the emails. Some emails may contain highly sensitive personal or business information that requires strong protection.
  - SMTP Credentials: SMTP server usernames and passwords used to configure SwiftMailer. These are highly sensitive and must be protected to prevent unauthorized email sending and potential abuse.
