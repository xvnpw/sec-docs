## Attack Tree Path: [Email Header Injection [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/email_header_injection__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attackers identify input fields in the application that are used to construct email headers when sending emails via SwiftMailer.
    *   If these input fields are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious headers by including newline characters (%0A, %0D) followed by the headers they want to inject.
    *   Injected headers can manipulate email behavior, leading to various attacks.

*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **1.1. Email Header Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:** The vulnerability itself.
    *   **1.1.1. Identify Input Vulnerable to Header Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker's first step to find vulnerable input points.
    *   **1.1.2. Inject Malicious Headers [CRITICAL NODE]:** The exploitation step where malicious headers are crafted and injected.

*   **High-Risk Secondary Attack:**
    *   **1.1.3.1. Spam/Phishing Distribution [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   By injecting headers like `BCC` or manipulating `To`, `From`, and `Subject`, attackers can use the application to send spam or phishing emails.
        *   This can damage the application's reputation, lead to blacklisting, and have legal repercussions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting SwiftMailer's Configuration and Transports [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_swiftmailer's_configuration_and_transports__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attackers target vulnerabilities related to how SwiftMailer is configured, particularly the SMTP settings.
    *   Insecure configurations, such as exposed configuration files or weak SMTP credentials, can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the SMTP server.

*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **1.3. Exploiting SwiftMailer's Configuration and Transports [CRITICAL NODE]:** The broad category of configuration-related attacks.
    *   **1.3.1. Insecure SMTP Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:** The root cause of vulnerabilities in this path.
    *   **1.3.1.1. Identify SMTP Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**  The attacker's goal to obtain SMTP credentials.
        *   **1.3.1.1.1. Configuration File Exposure [CRITICAL NODE]:** A common method where credentials are leaked through publicly accessible configuration files.
        *   **1.3.1.1.3. Weak Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Using easily guessable or default passwords for the SMTP account.
    *   **1.3.1.2. Abuse SMTP Access [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Exploiting gained SMTP access for malicious purposes.

*   **High-Risk Abuse:**
    *   **1.3.1.2.1. Unauthorized Email Sending [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   With compromised SMTP credentials, attackers can use the application's SMTP configuration to send emails without authorization.
        *   This is often used for large-scale spam or phishing campaigns, causing significant damage to the application's reputation and potentially the SMTP server itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Email Bombing [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_email_bombing__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attackers identify application features that trigger email sending, such as contact forms, registration, or password reset.
    *   They then abuse these features by sending a large volume of email requests, aiming to overwhelm the application, the mail server, or recipient inboxes.

*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Email Bombing [CRITICAL NODE]:** The overall DoS attack vector.
    *   **2.1. Identify Email Sending Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker's initial step to find email sending features.
    *   **2.2. Abuse Email Sending Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]:** The exploitation step to flood the system with email requests.
        *   **2.2.1. Send Excessive Emails [HIGH RISK PATH]:** The specific method of sending a large number of emails to cause DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **2.3. Cause Application or Service Disruption:**
        *   Successful email bombing can lead to application slowdown or unavailability, mail server overload, and recipient inboxes being flooded.
        *   Legitimate emails may be missed, and the application's services can be severely disrupted.
