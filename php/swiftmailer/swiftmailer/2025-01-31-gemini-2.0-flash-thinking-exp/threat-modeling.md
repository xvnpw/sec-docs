# Threat Model Analysis for swiftmailer/swiftmailer

## Threat: [Email Header Injection](./threats/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Email Header Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-supplied input that is used to construct email headers. By injecting special characters, they can add arbitrary headers to the email. This is done by exploiting insufficient input validation in the application *before* passing data to Swiftmailer, leading to Swiftmailer sending emails with attacker-controlled headers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Spam and Phishing campaigns by injecting `Bcc:` headers.
    *   Bypassing spam filters and security gateways.
    *   Email Spoofing by manipulating `From:` and `Reply-To:` headers.
*   **Affected Swiftmailer Component:**  `Swift_Message` class, header setting functions (e.g., `setTo()`, `setFrom()`, `setSubject()`, `getHeaders()`, `addPart()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Application):**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs intended for email headers *before* using Swiftmailer functions.
    *   **Use Swiftmailer API Correctly (Application):** Utilize Swiftmailer's API functions for setting headers instead of direct string manipulation.
    *   **Templating (Application):** Employ email templates with predefined headers to minimize dynamic header generation.

## Threat: [Email Body Injection (HTML/Content Spoofing)](./threats/email_body_injection__htmlcontent_spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Email Body Injection (HTML/Content Spoofing)
*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into the email body if the application dynamically constructs the email body using unsanitized user input and passes it to Swiftmailer. For HTML emails, this can lead to HTML injection and potentially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the email client renders the HTML and JavaScript sent by Swiftmailer.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Content Spoofing: Injecting misleading or false information.
    *   HTML Injection/XSS (in HTML emails): Injecting malicious HTML and JavaScript, potentially leading to session hijacking or information theft.
*   **Affected Swiftmailer Component:** `Swift_Message` class, specifically `setBody()` and `addPart()` functions used to set the email body content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Escaping (Application):** Sanitize and escape user input used in the email body *before* setting it in Swiftmailer, especially for HTML emails.
    *   **Templating Engines (Application):** Utilize templating engines to ensure automatic escaping of dynamic content within email bodies.
    *   **Plain Text Emails (Application):** Prefer sending plain text emails to reduce HTML injection risks.

## Threat: [SMTP Credentials Exposure](./threats/smtp_credentials_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** SMTP Credentials Exposure
*   **Description:**  SMTP credentials (username, password) required by Swiftmailer are stored insecurely or become exposed. Attackers can gain access to these credentials and use them with Swiftmailer or directly with the SMTP server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Email Sending: Attackers can send emails as the application, potentially for spam, phishing, etc.
    *   Reputation Damage: Abuse of the SMTP server can lead to blacklisting and damage the application's email sending reputation.
    *   Potential Access to Internal Systems: Compromised credentials might grant access to other internal systems.
*   **Affected Swiftmailer Component:** Configuration of `Swift_SmtpTransport` or other transport classes where credentials are set (e.g., `setUsername()`, `setPassword()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Storage (Application & Infrastructure):** Store SMTP credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or encrypted configuration files.
    *   **Restrict Access (Infrastructure & Operations):** Limit access to configuration files and environment variables containing SMTP credentials.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation (Operations):** Periodically change SMTP passwords.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Swiftmailer Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_swiftmailer_library.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Swiftmailer Library
*   **Description:** Swiftmailer itself may contain security vulnerabilities in its code. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could directly compromise the application using Swiftmailer.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Critical vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Vulnerabilities could be exploited to crash the application or email sending functionality.
    *   Information Disclosure: Vulnerabilities might leak sensitive information.
*   **Affected Swiftmailer Component:** Various components of Swiftmailer depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Critical to High depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Swiftmailer Up-to-Date (Development & Operations):** Regularly update Swiftmailer to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Monitoring (Development & Operations):** Monitor security advisories related to Swiftmailer.
    *   **Dependency Scanning (Development):** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Swiftmailer.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Swiftmailer's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_swiftmailer's_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Swiftmailer's Dependencies
*   **Description:** Swiftmailer relies on other PHP libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Swiftmailer and the application.
*   **Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in Swiftmailer itself (RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure), depending on the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Affected Swiftmailer Component:** Indirectly affects Swiftmailer through its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Critical to High depending on the specific dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management (Development):** Use Composer to manage Swiftmailer's dependencies.
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates (Development & Operations):** Keep Swiftmailer's dependencies up-to-date.
    *   **Dependency Scanning (Development):** Include Swiftmailer's dependencies in dependency scanning processes.

## Threat: [Insecure SMTP Configuration (Plaintext Transmission)](./threats/insecure_smtp_configuration__plaintext_transmission_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure SMTP Configuration (Plaintext Transmission)
*   **Description:** Misconfiguration of SMTP settings in Swiftmailer, using plain SMTP without TLS/SSL encryption. This leads to plaintext transmission of SMTP credentials and email content when Swiftmailer communicates with the SMTP server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Plaintext Credential Exposure: SMTP username and password are transmitted in plaintext.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Email communication is vulnerable to interception and modification.
    *   Information Disclosure: Email content is transmitted in plaintext and can be intercepted.
*   **Affected Swiftmailer Component:** `Swift_SmtpTransport` class configuration, specifically the `setEncryption()` and `setPort()` functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure Protocols (Operations & Development):** Always configure Swiftmailer to use secure SMTP protocols like STARTTLS or SMTPS (SSL/TLS).
    *   **Verify TLS/SSL Certificates (Operations & Development):** Ensure proper TLS/SSL certificate verification is enabled.
    *   **Enforce Secure Connection (SMTP Server Configuration - Infrastructure):** Configure the SMTP server to enforce secure connections.
