# Attack Surface Analysis for swiftmailer/swiftmailer

## Attack Surface: [Email Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting SwiftMailer's header handling to inject malicious headers by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct email headers.
*   **SwiftMailer Contribution:** SwiftMailer provides functions like `setSubject()`, `setTo()`, `setFrom()`, `addCc()`, `addBcc()`, and `addHeader()` which, if used with unsanitized user input, directly enable header injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A web form takes user input for the "Subject" field and directly uses it in `Swift_Message->setSubject($userInput)`. An attacker enters "Subject: Test\nBcc: attacker@example.com" in the subject field. SwiftMailer, without proper handling by the developer, will inject the "Bcc" header, sending the email to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Spam distribution, phishing campaigns, email spoofing, bypassing security controls, and damage to sender reputation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user inputs before using them in SwiftMailer's header setting functions. Remove or encode newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) and other control characters that can be used for header injection.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats for email headers. For example, validate email addresses using appropriate functions.
    *   **Secure API Usage:** Utilize SwiftMailer's API in a way that minimizes direct user input into header construction. Consider using predefined subjects or limiting user-controlled parts of headers.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities (Path Traversal/LFI)](./attack_surfaces/attachment_handling_vulnerabilities__path_traversallfi_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting SwiftMailer's attachment functionality by providing manipulated file paths, leading to unauthorized access to local files on the server (Local File Inclusion - LFI) or path traversal.
*   **SwiftMailer Contribution:** SwiftMailer's `Swift_Attachment::fromPath()` function directly uses file paths provided to it. If an application uses user-provided input to construct these paths without validation, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal and LFI attacks through SwiftMailer.
*   **Example:** A feature allows users to "attach a file" by providing a filename. The application directly uses this filename in `Swift_Attachment::fromPath($userInput)`. An attacker provides "../../../etc/passwd" as the filename. SwiftMailer, instructed by the application, attempts to attach this file, potentially leading to the disclosure of the password file if the application doesn't properly restrict file access.
*   **Impact:** Local File Inclusion (LFI), information disclosure of sensitive files (configuration files, source code, etc.), which can be a stepping stone for further, more critical attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization for File Paths:**  Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that is used to construct file paths for attachments in SwiftMailer. Whitelist allowed characters and patterns.
    *   **Path Normalization:** Use path normalization functions (like `realpath()` in PHP) to resolve relative paths and prevent traversal attempts before passing paths to `Swift_Attachment::fromPath()`.
    *   **Restrict File System Access:** Ensure the application user running SwiftMailer has the minimal necessary file system permissions. Limit access to sensitive directories and files.

These two attack surfaces represent the most critical risks directly introduced by using SwiftMailer when developers do not follow secure coding practices. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining the security of applications utilizing the SwiftMailer library.
