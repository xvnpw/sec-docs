## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Email Parameters (SwiftMailer Context)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_email_parameters__swiftmailer_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify SwiftMailer Input Points:** Locate all code sections where user input is used to set SwiftMailer message parameters (To, From, Subject, Body, Headers, Attachments).
    *   **Step 2: Validate Email Addresses (SwiftMailer):** Use SwiftMailer's built-in validation (`Swift_Validate::email()`) or a dedicated email validation library to validate all email addresses provided as input for SwiftMailer's `setTo()`, `setFrom()`, `setCc()`, `setBcc()`, `setReplyTo()` methods.
    *   **Step 3: Sanitize Headers (SwiftMailer):** If using user input to set custom headers via SwiftMailer's header API, sanitize header values to prevent header injection. Avoid using user input for header names if possible.
    *   **Step 4: Sanitize Email Body (SwiftMailer):** Sanitize user input used in `setBody()` for both plain text and HTML emails to prevent email injection and XSS within emails. For HTML bodies, use HTML sanitization libraries or templating engines with auto-escaping.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Email Injection (via SwiftMailer):** High Severity. Attackers injecting malicious headers or content through user input processed by SwiftMailer, leading to spam, phishing, or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Emails (via SwiftMailer):** Medium Severity. Injecting malicious scripts into HTML email bodies via user input processed by SwiftMailer, executing when recipients view the email.

*   **Impact:**
