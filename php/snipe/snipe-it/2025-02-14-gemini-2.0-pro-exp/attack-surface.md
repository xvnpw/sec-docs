# Attack Surface Analysis for snipe/snipe-it

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation (User Management)](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation__user_management_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with limited user privileges exploits a vulnerability to gain higher-level access (e.g., administrator).
*   **Snipe-IT Contribution:**  Snipe-IT's role-based access control (RBAC) system, if flawed, can be bypassed.  The complexity of managing users, permissions, and asset assignments creates potential vulnerabilities *specific to the application's logic*.
*   **Example:** A user with "view-only" access to assets exploits a bug in the Snipe-IT user profile update functionality (a component *specific to Snipe-IT*) to grant themselves "admin" privileges.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise; the attacker gains full control over all assets, data, and user accounts managed *within Snipe-IT*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user input fields, especially those related to user roles and permissions *within Snipe-IT's code*.
        *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing (including penetration testing) of the Snipe-IT RBAC system.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP) in Snipe-IT's code design – only grant the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly audit and review the Snipe-IT RBAC implementation.
        *   Use a well-vetted and secure authorization library *within the Snipe-IT codebase*.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Regularly review user roles and permissions *within Snipe-IT*, ensuring users have only the access they need.
        *   Disable or delete inactive user accounts promptly *within Snipe-IT*.
        *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA), especially for administrative accounts *accessing Snipe-IT*.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Asset Modification/Deletion (Asset Management)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_asset_modificationdeletion__asset_management_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify or delete asset records without proper authorization.
*   **Snipe-IT Contribution:**  Snipe-IT's core function is managing asset data.  Vulnerabilities in the create/update/delete workflows *within Snipe-IT's code* can be exploited. This is entirely within Snipe-IT's domain.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in the Snipe-IT asset search functionality (a feature *specific to Snipe-IT*) to delete multiple asset records.  Or, an attacker bypasses authorization checks on a Snipe-IT API endpoint to modify asset serial numbers.
*   **Impact:**  Data loss, data integrity issues, financial loss (if assets are misrepresented), difficulty tracking assets, potential legal and compliance issues – all directly related to the data *managed by Snipe-IT*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all asset-related data fields *within Snipe-IT*.
        *   Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities *in Snipe-IT's database interactions*.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks at every stage of the asset lifecycle (create, read, update, delete) *within Snipe-IT's logic*.
        *   Implement comprehensive audit logging of all asset modifications and deletions, including the user responsible, *within Snipe-IT*.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Regularly review audit logs *within Snipe-IT* for suspicious activity.
        *   Implement a strong separation of duties – different users should be responsible for creating, approving, and deleting assets *within Snipe-IT*.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication/Authorization Bypass (API Access)](./attack_surfaces/api_authenticationauthorization_bypass__api_access_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Snipe-IT API, bypassing authentication or authorization checks.
*   **Snipe-IT Contribution:**  Snipe-IT provides a REST API for integration and automation.  If not properly secured, this API *provided by Snipe-IT* becomes a major attack vector. This is entirely a Snipe-IT surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a Snipe-IT API endpoint that does not require an API key or uses a default/weak API key.  They use this *Snipe-IT endpoint* to retrieve all asset data.  Or, an attacker uses a valid Snipe-IT API key but exploits a flaw in the *Snipe-IT authorization logic* to access data they shouldn't.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, unauthorized asset manipulation, potential system compromise (if the *Snipe-IT API* allows administrative actions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Require strong authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) for *all Snipe-IT API endpoints*.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks for each *Snipe-IT API endpoint*, ensuring users can only access the data and perform the actions they are permitted to.
        *   Implement rate limiting *on the Snipe-IT API* to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
        *   Use a well-established API security framework *within the Snipe-IT codebase*.
        *   Thoroughly document the *Snipe-IT API* and its security requirements.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Generate strong, unique API keys for each application or integration *using Snipe-IT*.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys *used with Snipe-IT*.
        *   Monitor *Snipe-IT API* usage for suspicious activity.
        *   Disable the *Snipe-IT API* if it's not needed.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks (Custom Fields, Import Functionality)](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks__custom_fields__import_functionality_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code (e.g., SQL, JavaScript, shell commands) into the application through input fields.
*   **Snipe-IT Contribution:**  Snipe-IT's custom fields and import functionality are particularly vulnerable if input validation and sanitization *within Snipe-IT* are inadequate. These are features *specific to Snipe-IT*.
*   **Example:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker enters JavaScript code into a Snipe-IT custom field (e.g., "Asset Description"). When another user views the asset *within Snipe-IT*, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing their Snipe-IT session cookie.
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker enters SQL code into a Snipe-IT custom field or an imported CSV file *processed by Snipe-IT*. When Snipe-IT processes this data, the malicious SQL code executes, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data *within Snipe-IT's database*.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, data corruption, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, potential system compromise (depending on the type of injection) – all impacting data and functionality *within Snipe-IT*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement *strict* input validation and output encoding for *all* user-supplied data, especially in Snipe-IT's custom fields and import functionality.
        *   Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection *within Snipe-IT's database interactions*.
        *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks *originating from Snipe-IT*.
        *   Sanitize imported data *before* processing it *within Snipe-IT*.  Validate file types and contents.
        *   Consider limiting the data types allowed in Snipe-IT's custom fields.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Be cautious when importing data from untrusted sources *into Snipe-IT*.
        *   Regularly review custom field definitions and usage *within Snipe-IT*.

## Attack Surface: [Account Takeover (User Management)](./attack_surfaces/account_takeover__user_management_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to legitimate user accounts within Snipe-IT, especially those with elevated privileges.
*   **Snipe-IT Contribution:** Snipe-IT's user management system, if not properly secured with strong authentication mechanisms, is susceptible to account takeover. This is entirely within Snipe-IT's domain.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a combination of phishing and password reuse to gain access to a Snipe-IT administrator account.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized asset manipulation, potential system compromise - all within the context of Snipe-IT.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, and disallow common passwords) *within Snipe-IT*.
        *   Implement and *strongly encourage* the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, especially administrators, *accessing Snipe-IT*.
        *   Provide secure password reset mechanisms that are resistant to abuse *within Snipe-IT*.
        *   Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks *against Snipe-IT accounts*.
        *   Monitor for suspicious login activity *within Snipe-IT*.
    *   **Users/Administrators:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for all *Snipe-IT accounts*.
        *   Enable MFA wherever possible *within Snipe-IT*.
        *   Be vigilant against phishing attacks targeting *Snipe-IT credentials*.
        *   Regularly review account activity *within Snipe-IT*.
