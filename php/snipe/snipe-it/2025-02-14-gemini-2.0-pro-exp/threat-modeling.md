# Threat Model Analysis for snipe/snipe-it

## Threat: [Threat: Unauthorized Data Access via RBAC Bypass](./threats/threat_unauthorized_data_access_via_rbac_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in Snipe-IT's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation or configuration. This could involve escalating privileges, bypassing intended restrictions, or exploiting a logic error in how permissions are checked. The attacker might use crafted requests, manipulate session data, or exploit a vulnerability in the permission checking code.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive asset data, including serial numbers, user assignments, locations, and custom field data. This could lead to data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and compliance violations.
*   **Affected Component:** Snipe-IT's RBAC system, specifically the permission checking logic and user/role management modules (e.g., `app/models/User.php`, `app/models/Role.php`, related controllers and middleware).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of the RBAC implementation, focusing on permission checks and authorization logic.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Perform regular penetration testing, specifically targeting the RBAC system, to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Strictly enforce the principle of least privilege.  Ensure users have only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Permission Audits:** Regularly audit user permissions and roles to ensure they are still appropriate and haven't been inadvertently elevated.
    *   **Input Validation:** Ensure all user input related to permissions and roles is strictly validated.
    *   **Automated Security Testing:** Integrate automated security testing tools into the development pipeline to detect RBAC vulnerabilities early.

## Threat: [Threat: API Key Compromise and Abuse](./threats/threat_api_key_compromise_and_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Snipe-IT API key through theft, social engineering, or by finding it exposed in code repositories, configuration files, or logs. The attacker then uses the compromised key to make unauthorized API calls, potentially retrieving, modifying, or deleting asset data.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the Snipe-IT system via the API, leading to data breaches, data modification, data deletion, and potential denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Snipe-IT's API (`app/Http/Controllers/Api`), API key management, and any code that interacts with the API.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Never store API keys in source code or easily accessible configuration files. Use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate API keys.
    *   **Least Privilege for API Keys:**  Create API keys with the minimum necessary permissions.  Don't use a single, all-powerful key.
    *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks and abuse.
    *   **API Request Logging and Monitoring:** Log all API requests and monitor for suspicious activity.
    *   **IP Whitelisting:** If possible, restrict API access to specific IP addresses.

## Threat: [Threat: Data Leakage through Misconfigured Asset Visibility](./threats/threat_data_leakage_through_misconfigured_asset_visibility.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to asset information that should be restricted due to misconfigured visibility settings. This could involve exploiting the "View All Assets" permission if improperly assigned, or accessing publicly accessible asset views if unintentionally enabled. The attacker might simply browse the application or use automated scripts to scrape data.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive asset data to unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to data breaches, competitive disadvantage, or privacy violations.
*   **Affected Component:** Asset listing and viewing functionality (`app/controllers/AssetsController.php`, related views, and potentially the `Asset` model).  The "View All Assets" permission and any public-facing asset view settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Public Views:** Ensure that public asset viewing is disabled unless absolutely necessary and tightly controlled.
    *   **Restrict "View All" Permission:**  Carefully control the assignment of the "View All Assets" permission.  Grant it only to users who absolutely require it.
    *   **Regular Configuration Review:**  Periodically review all asset visibility settings to ensure they are configured correctly.
    *   **User Training:** Train users on the importance of properly configuring asset visibility.

## Threat: [Threat: Data Tampering via Import/Export Functionality](./threats/threat_data_tampering_via_importexport_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with import privileges uploads a maliciously crafted CSV or other import file containing manipulated asset data. This could be used to overwrite existing data, inject malicious data, or cause denial of service by overloading the system.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, injection of malicious data, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Snipe-IT's import/export functionality (`app/Http/Controllers/ImportsController.php`, related models and validation logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Implement rigorous input validation on all imported data, including data type checks, length limits, and sanitization.
    *   **Data Integrity Checks:**  Implement checks to ensure the integrity of imported data before it is committed to the database.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate and size of import operations to prevent abuse.
    *   **User Training:** Train users on the proper use of the import functionality and the risks of importing untrusted data.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Log all import operations, including the user, timestamp, and the data imported.

## Threat: [Threat:  Insecure File Uploads](./threats/threat__insecure_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a web shell, malware) through Snipe-IT's file upload functionality, exploiting insufficient validation of file types, sizes, or content.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, malware infection, system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** File upload functionality (likely within `app/Http/Controllers/AssetsController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/UsersController.php`, and related models and views, handling uploads for assets, users, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation:**  Allow only specific, necessary file types.  Use a whitelist approach, not a blacklist.  Validate the file type based on its content, not just its extension.
    *   **File Size Limits:**  Enforce reasonable file size limits.
    *   **File Renaming:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent attackers from controlling the file name and extension.
    *   **Store Files Outside Web Root:**  Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct access via a URL.
    *   **Malware Scanning:**  Scan uploaded files for malware using a reputable antivirus solution.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict the types of content that can be loaded and executed by the browser.
