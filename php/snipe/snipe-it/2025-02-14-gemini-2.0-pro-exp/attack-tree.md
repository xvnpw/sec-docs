## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerability in Custom Fields (e.g., XSS, SQLi) [CN][HR]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerability_in_custom_fields__e_g___xss__sqli___cn__hr_.md)

Description: Snipe-IT's custom field functionality allows users to define additional fields for assets. If input validation and output encoding are not rigorously implemented for these custom fields, attackers can inject malicious code.
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a custom field. When another user views the asset, the injected code executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal their session cookies, redirect them to a malicious website, or deface the page.
    SQL Injection (SQLi): An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into a custom field. If the application uses this input directly in a database query without proper sanitization, the attacker's code could be executed by the database server. This could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, potentially even gaining full control of the database and the application.
Likelihood: High (Custom fields are a common attack vector if not handled properly)
Impact: High to Very High (SQLi could lead to full database compromise; XSS could lead to session hijacking and data theft)
Effort: Low to Medium (Exploiting basic XSS or SQLi can be relatively easy with automated tools)
Skill Level: Intermediate (Basic understanding of web vulnerabilities is needed)
Detection Difficulty: Medium (XSS might be detected by browser security features or WAFs; SQLi might be detected by intrusion detection systems or database monitoring)
Mitigation:
    Implement strict input validation on all custom fields, using a whitelist approach.
    Properly encode output when displaying custom field data to prevent XSS.
    Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions involving custom fields.
    Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting custom field functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak/Default Credentials (Brute-force, Credential Stuffing) [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/weakdefault_credentials__brute-force__credential_stuffing___cn___hr_.md)

Description: Attackers can gain unauthorized access if default credentials are not changed after installation or if users choose weak, easily guessable passwords.
    Brute-Force Attack: An attacker systematically tries different username and password combinations until they find a valid one.
    Credential Stuffing: An attacker uses lists of usernames and passwords that have been leaked from other breaches, hoping that users have reused the same credentials on the Snipe-IT instance.
Likelihood: High (Default credentials are often left unchanged, and weak passwords are common)
Impact: High (Leads to unauthorized access to the Snipe-IT instance)
Effort: Very Low to Low (Automated tools can easily perform brute-force and credential stuffing attacks)
Skill Level: Novice (Basic tools and techniques are sufficient)
Detection Difficulty: Easy to Medium (Failed login attempts are usually logged; rate limiting and account lockout can help detect and prevent these attacks)
    Mitigation:
    Force password change on the first login for all users.
    Enforce a strong password policy.
    Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
    Strongly recommend enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
    Monitor logs for failed login attempts and implement rate limiting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing/Social Engineering targeting Snipe-IT Admins/Users [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/phishingsocial_engineering_targeting_snipe-it_adminsusers__hr_.md)

Description: Attackers can target Snipe-IT users with deceptive emails or other communication methods to trick them into revealing their credentials or installing malware.
    Phishing: An attacker sends an email that appears to be from a legitimate source (e.g., Snipe-IT support, a colleague) but contains a malicious link or attachment.
    Social Engineering: An attacker uses psychological manipulation to convince a user to divulge sensitive information or perform an action that compromises security.
Likelihood: High (Phishing is a very common and effective attack vector)
Impact: High (Could lead to credential theft or malware installation)
Effort: Low to Medium (Crafting a convincing phishing email can be relatively easy)
Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate (Basic social engineering skills are needed)
Detection Difficulty: Medium (Email security systems can detect some phishing emails, but sophisticated attacks can bypass these defenses; user awareness is key)
Mitigation:
    Provide regular security awareness training to all users.
    Implement email security measures (spam filtering, anti-phishing protection, sender authentication).
    Encourage users to verify the legitimacy of requests for sensitive information.
