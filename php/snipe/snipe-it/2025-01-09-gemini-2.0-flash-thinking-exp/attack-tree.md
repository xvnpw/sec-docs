## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Web Interface Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_web_interface_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** OR SQL Injection **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Inject malicious SQL queries via input fields
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Gain access to the database, modify data, or execute arbitrary commands
*   Command Injection **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Inject malicious commands via input fields that are processed by the server
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** OR Authentication/Authorization Flaws **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit weak password policies or lack of multi-factor authentication **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Brute-force or dictionary attacks to gain access
    *   Bypass authentication or authorization checks due to flawed logic
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Access administrative functionalities or sensitive data without proper credentials

**1. Exploiting Web Interface Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them into input fields (e.g., search boxes, login forms, asset creation fields) that are not properly sanitized or parameterized.
    *   **Impact:** Successful injection can allow the attacker to:
        *   Bypass authentication and login as any user.
        *   Extract sensitive data from the database, including asset information, user credentials, and configuration details.
        *   Modify or delete data, potentially disrupting operations or causing data loss.
        *   In some cases, execute arbitrary commands on the database server or the underlying operating system.
*   **Command Injection:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious commands into input fields that are used to construct system commands executed by the server. This often occurs when the application directly uses user-supplied data in functions like `system()`, `exec()`, or similar.
    *   **Impact:** Successful injection allows the attacker to:
        *   Execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server process.
        *   Potentially gain full control over the server, install malware, or pivot to other systems on the network.
*   **Authentication/Authorization Flaws:**
    *   **Exploiting weak password policies or lack of multi-factor authentication:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use techniques like brute-force attacks (trying many password combinations) or dictionary attacks (using lists of common passwords) to guess user credentials, especially if password complexity requirements are weak or multi-factor authentication is not enabled.
        *   **Impact:** Successful credential compromise allows attackers to log in as legitimate users, gaining access to their data and potentially their privileges.
    *   **Bypassing authentication or authorization checks due to flawed logic:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's code that incorrectly handle authentication or authorization. This could involve manipulating parameters, exploiting race conditions, or bypassing checks due to logical errors in the code.
        *   **Impact:** Successful bypass can grant attackers access to administrative functionalities or sensitive data without proper credentials, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** OR Insecure API Endpoints **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Access or manipulate data through unprotected API endpoints
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Retrieve sensitive asset information or perform unauthorized actions
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** OR Missing or Weak Authentication/Authorization for API **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Access API functionalities without proper credentials
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Interact with asset data or system settings without authorization

**2. Exploiting API Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure API Endpoints:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and access API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization controls. This might involve directly accessing URLs or manipulating API requests.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can:
        *   Retrieve sensitive asset information, user details, or other confidential data.
        *   Perform unauthorized actions, such as creating, modifying, or deleting assets or users.
*   **Missing or Weak Authentication/Authorization for API:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The API lacks proper mechanisms to verify the identity of the requester or to enforce access controls based on user roles and permissions. This can involve missing API keys, weak token generation, or insufficient validation of authentication credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can:
        *   Access and manipulate API functionalities without proper authorization.
        *   Interact with asset data or system settings as if they were legitimate users or administrators.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Handling Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** OR Unrestricted File Upload **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Upload malicious files (e.g., PHP shells)
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Gain remote code execution on the server

**3. Exploiting File Handling Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application allows users to upload files without sufficient restrictions on file types, size, or content. Attackers can upload malicious files, such as PHP shells or other executable scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Successful upload of a malicious file can lead to:
        *   Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control.
        *   Deployment of malware or other malicious software.
        *   Data exfiltration or defacement of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Snipe-IT
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code

**4. Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify known vulnerabilities (often documented with CVEs) in the third-party libraries and dependencies used by Snipe-IT. They then craft exploits targeting these specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Remote code execution on the server.
    *   Unauthorized access to data or functionalities.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Other security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Snipe-IT Setup **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_snipe-it_setup__critical_node_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** AND Use of Default Credentials **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Access the application using default administrator credentials
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Gain full control over the Snipe-IT instance
*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** AND Failure to Apply Security Patches **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Snipe-IT
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Gain unauthorized access or disrupt functionality

**5. Exploiting Misconfigurations in Snipe-IT Setup:**

*   **Use of Default Credentials:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in using the default administrator credentials that are often documented or easily guessable if not changed after installation.
    *   **Impact:** Successful login with default credentials grants the attacker full administrative control over the Snipe-IT instance.
*   **Failure to Apply Security Patches:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in specific versions of Snipe-IT that have been publicly disclosed and for which patches are available but not applied. They use readily available exploits or develop their own.
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to:
        *   Unauthorized access to the application and its data.
        *   Remote code execution on the server.
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Other security breaches depending on the specific vulnerability.
