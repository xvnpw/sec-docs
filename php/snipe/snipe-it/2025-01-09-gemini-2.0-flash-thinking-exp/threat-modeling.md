## Threat: [Insecure API Key Storage and Transmission](./threats/insecure_api_key_storage_and_transmission.md)

*   **Description:** If Snipe-IT utilizes API keys for its own integrations or allows users to generate them, an attacker could intercept or discover these keys if they are stored insecurely within Snipe-IT (e.g., in plain text in configuration files or the database) or transmitted over unencrypted channels.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Snipe-IT API, potentially allowing for data exfiltration, manipulation, or denial of service against the Snipe-IT instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** API Integration Module (Snipe-IT's API key management), Configuration Management (how Snipe-IT stores keys).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely using encryption or dedicated secrets management solutions within Snipe-IT.
        *   Transmit API keys over HTTPS only when interacting with the Snipe-IT API.
        *   Implement proper access controls and key rotation policies for API keys within Snipe-IT.

## Threat: [LDAP/AD Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/ldapad_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If Snipe-IT integrates with LDAP or Active Directory for authentication or user synchronization, an attacker could inject malicious code into LDAP queries if user-supplied input processed by Snipe-IT is not properly sanitized. This could allow them to bypass authentication to Snipe-IT or retrieve sensitive information from the directory service.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Snipe-IT user accounts, potential extraction of sensitive information from the linked directory service via Snipe-IT.
    *   **Affected Component:** LDAP/AD Integration Module (how Snipe-IT interacts with the directory service), Authentication Module (if used for login).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for LDAP interactions within Snipe-IT.
        *   Properly sanitize and validate user input before including it in LDAP queries within the Snipe-IT codebase.
        *   Follow secure coding practices for LDAP integration within Snipe-IT.

## Threat: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Fields](./threats/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_custom_fields.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into custom fields within Snipe-IT if the application does not properly sanitize user input. When other users view assets with these malicious custom fields within Snipe-IT, the script could execute in their browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking of Snipe-IT users, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites from within the Snipe-IT interface, potential execution of arbitrary code on the user's machine while interacting with Snipe-IT.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Fields Module (how Snipe-IT stores and displays custom field data), User Interface (rendering of custom fields).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all custom fields within the Snipe-IT codebase.
        *   Use context-aware output encoding when displaying custom field data within Snipe-IT.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Snipe-IT application.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/unrestricted_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If Snipe-IT allows file uploads (e.g., for asset documentation) without proper validation of file types and content, an attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) and potentially execute them on the Snipe-IT server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Snipe-IT server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data stored by Snipe-IT, and potentially pivot to other systems on the same network.
    *   **Affected Component:** File Upload Functionality (within Snipe-IT, e.g., for asset attachments).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation (whitelist allowed extensions) within Snipe-IT's file upload functionality.
        *   Scan uploaded files for malware before storing them within Snipe-IT.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot of the Snipe-IT application and serve them through a separate, sandboxed mechanism if necessary.
        *   Restrict execution permissions on the upload directory used by Snipe-IT.

## Threat: [Insecure Backup and Restore Process](./threats/insecure_backup_and_restore_process.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Snipe-IT's backup and restore mechanisms could allow an attacker to access sensitive backup data if backups are not properly secured (e.g., unencrypted, stored in publicly accessible locations by the Snipe-IT setup) or to manipulate the restore process for malicious purposes within the Snipe-IT application.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive asset data managed by Snipe-IT, potential data corruption or loss within the Snipe-IT database, ability to restore the application to a compromised state.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backup and Restore Functionality (specific to Snipe-IT's implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt backups at rest and in transit within the Snipe-IT backup process.
        *   Securely store backup files with appropriate access controls in the Snipe-IT deployment environment.
        *   Regularly test the backup and restore process for Snipe-IT.
        *   Implement integrity checks for backup files generated by Snipe-IT.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Snipe-IT relies on various third-party libraries and packages. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies, if not promptly patched in the Snipe-IT codebase, could be exploited by attackers targeting the Snipe-IT instance.
