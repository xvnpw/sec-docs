# Attack Surface Analysis for snipe/snipe-it

## Attack Surface: [Custom Field Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_field_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Insufficient validation of user-supplied data when creating or editing custom fields. This can lead to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection vulnerabilities.

**How Snipe-IT Contributes:** Snipe-IT allows administrators to create custom fields with various data types. If the application doesn't properly sanitize and validate the input provided for these fields, malicious scripts or code can be stored in the database. This is a direct feature of Snipe-IT.

**Example:** An administrator creates a custom field for "Notes" and an attacker with sufficient privileges inserts `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` into this field for an asset. When another user views this asset within Snipe-IT, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Stored XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks affecting users of the Snipe-IT application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust input validation on the server-side within Snipe-IT's code for all custom field data, including length limits, data type checks, and escaping special characters.
    *   Utilize Snipe-IT's templating engine in a way that automatically escapes output by default to prevent XSS.
    *   Regularly review and update input validation logic within Snipe-IT's codebase.

## Attack Surface: [LDAP/Active Directory Integration Flaws](./attack_surfaces/ldapactive_directory_integration_flaws.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the integration with LDAP or Active Directory for user authentication. This can include insecure binding configurations or insufficient input sanitization during authentication queries specific to Snipe-IT's implementation.

**How Snipe-IT Contributes:** Snipe-IT offers direct integration with LDAP/AD for centralized user management. Flaws in how Snipe-IT implements this integration create attack vectors.

**Example:** An attacker could exploit a poorly configured LDAP query within Snipe-IT's authentication logic to bypass authentication by injecting malicious LDAP syntax (LDAP injection).

**Impact:** Authentication bypass allows unauthorized users to gain access to the Snipe-IT application. Compromised credentials can lead to data breaches and manipulation within Snipe-IT.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements within Snipe-IT's code when querying the LDAP/AD server to prevent LDAP injection.
    *   Ensure Snipe-IT's connection to the LDAP/AD server is secured using TLS/SSL.
    *   Avoid storing LDAP/AD credentials directly in Snipe-IT's application configuration; use secure credential management practices.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling (Avatar/Attachments)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling__avatarattachments_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities related to the handling of uploaded files within Snipe-IT, such as user avatars or attachments associated with assets. This can include unrestricted file uploads or insufficient validation, leading to remote code execution or other attacks directly targeting the Snipe-IT server.

**How Snipe-IT Contributes:** Snipe-IT's features allow users to upload avatars and attach files to assets. If these upload mechanisms within Snipe-IT are not properly secured, it introduces a significant risk.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script through Snipe-IT's avatar upload functionality. If the server is not configured to prevent execution of uploaded files in Snipe-IT's upload directory, the attacker could access the script and execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Snipe-IT.

**Impact:** Remote code execution can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches affecting Snipe-IT data, and denial of service of the Snipe-IT application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation within Snipe-IT's upload handling code based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot accessible by Snipe-IT to prevent direct execution.
    *   Randomize uploaded file names within Snipe-IT to prevent predictability.
    *   Implement size limits for uploaded files within Snipe-IT.

## Attack Surface: [Report Generation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/report_generation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in Snipe-IT's report generation functionality, especially if it involves user-provided input or templates, which could lead to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) or information disclosure directly from Snipe-IT data.

**How Snipe-IT Contributes:** Snipe-IT allows users to generate reports based on various criteria. If this process within Snipe-IT involves rendering templates with user-controlled data, it can be vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input within a Snipe-IT report filter or custom template that, when processed by Snipe-IT's template engine, executes arbitrary code on the server (SSTI).

**Impact:** SSTI can lead to remote code execution on the server hosting Snipe-IT. Information disclosure can expose sensitive asset data or user information managed by Snipe-IT.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Avoid allowing users to directly control template code or rendering logic within Snipe-IT's report generation feature.
    *   If custom templates are necessary in Snipe-IT, use a secure templating engine and implement strict sandboxing.
    *   Sanitize and validate user input used in Snipe-IT's report generation queries.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Management Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/api_key_management_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how Snipe-IT's API keys are generated, stored, or managed. Weaknesses can lead to unauthorized access to the Snipe-IT API and its data.

**How Snipe-IT Contributes:** Snipe-IT provides an API for programmatic access. The security of this API relies heavily on the proper management of API keys within Snipe-IT.

**Example:** API keys generated by Snipe-IT use a predictable algorithm or are stored in plaintext in Snipe-IT's configuration files. An attacker could guess or find these keys and use them to access and manipulate data through the Snipe-IT API.

**Impact:** Unauthorized API access can lead to data breaches of Snipe-IT data, manipulation of asset information within Snipe-IT, and potentially denial of service of the Snipe-IT API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Generate API keys within Snipe-IT using cryptographically secure random number generators.
    *   Store API keys securely within Snipe-IT using hashing and salting or dedicated secrets management solutions.
    *   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for Snipe-IT's API endpoints.
