    *   Snipe-IT could provide better integration options with common SIEM or log management platforms.
    *   Documentation could provide more detailed guidance on setting up security monitoring and alerting for Snipe-IT logs, including example alert rules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Snipe-IT Log Review](./mitigation_strategies/regular_snipe-it_log_review.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a schedule for regular manual review of Snipe-IT logs, even with automated monitoring in place.
    2.  Designate responsible personnel (e.g., security administrators, IT administrators) to perform log reviews.
    3.  During log reviews, look for:
        *   Anomalies or unusual patterns in authentication logs (e.g., spikes in failed logins, logins from unusual locations).
        *   Unexpected errors or warnings in application logs.
        *   Suspicious entries in modification logs (e.g., unauthorized changes to critical settings or user accounts).
        *   Any other log entries that seem out of the ordinary or potentially indicative of security issues.
    4.  Investigate any suspicious findings identified during log reviews.
    5.  Document log review activities and any actions taken as a result of findings.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Missed Automated Alerts (Medium Severity):** Automated security monitoring might not catch all types of security incidents. Manual log review can help identify issues that automated systems might miss.
    *   **Proactive Identification of Security Issues (Medium Severity):** Regular log review can proactively identify potential security weaknesses, misconfigurations, or early signs of attacks before they escalate into major incidents.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Missed Automated Alerts:** Medium risk reduction - manual log review acts as a safety net to catch issues missed by automated monitoring.
    *   **Proactive Identification of Security Issues:** Medium risk reduction - enables proactive security improvements and early detection of potential threats.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented as an automated feature within Snipe-IT, relies on manual administrative processes.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Snipe-IT could provide tools or features to assist with log review, such as log summarization, filtering, or highlighting of potentially suspicious entries.
    *   Documentation could provide guidance and best practices for effective manual log review for Snipe-IT security.
