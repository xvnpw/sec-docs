## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Exploit Default Credentials (if any - unlikely but check initial setup) (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to log in using default usernames and passwords that might be present in Snipe-IT after installation if not changed. While less likely in Snipe-IT, it's a common oversight in many applications.
    *   **Impact:** Full administrative access to Snipe-IT, complete control over asset management data and system functionalities.
*   **Brute-force/Credential Stuffing Attacks (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers use automated tools to try numerous username and password combinations to guess valid credentials. Credential stuffing involves using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially including administrator accounts, leading to data manipulation, theft, or system compromise.
*   **Exploit Misconfiguration of Roles/Permissions (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit incorrectly configured user roles and permissions within Snipe-IT. This could involve gaining access to functionalities or data that should be restricted based on their assigned role.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform actions beyond intended user privileges, potentially leading to data breaches or system disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection (High-Risk Path, Critical Node if applicable):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields that are not properly sanitized. If Snipe-IT's database queries are vulnerable, this can allow attackers to manipulate the database directly.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive asset management data), potential system compromise if database access allows command execution.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into Snipe-IT. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected content.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Stored XSS (e.g., in asset names, user profiles, custom fields) (High-Risk Path):** Persistent XSS attacks where the malicious script is stored in the database and executed every time a user views the affected data. Impact includes account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of Snipe-IT interface, and potential redirection to malicious sites.
        *   **Reflected XSS (e.g., via URL parameters, error messages) (High-Risk Path):** Non-persistent XSS attacks where the malicious script is injected through URL parameters or other request inputs and executed when the server reflects the unsanitized input back to the user. Impact includes account compromise, session hijacking, and redirection to malicious sites.
*   **File Upload Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files to Snipe-IT. If file upload functionality is not properly secured, attackers can upload files that can be executed by the server.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Upload Malicious Files (e.g., PHP shell, malware) (High-Risk Path):** Remote code execution on the Snipe-IT server, full system compromise, installation of backdoors, malware distribution.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Configuration Issues (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_configuration_issues__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Insecure Configuration (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting various insecure configurations in Snipe-IT and its environment.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Debug Mode Enabled in Production (High-Risk Path):** Information disclosure through verbose error messages, revealing sensitive paths, configuration details, and potentially database information, which can aid further attacks.
        *   **Weak Database Credentials (High-Risk Path):** Unauthorized access to the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential system compromise.
        *   **Exposed Configuration Files (e.g., `.env` file publicly accessible) (High-Risk Path):** Exposure of sensitive configuration details, including database credentials, API keys, encryption keys, and other secrets, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to various parts of the system.
        *   **Default Settings Not Changed (e.g., API keys, encryption keys) (High-Risk Path):** Exploiting default API keys or encryption keys if they are not changed from default values, potentially allowing unauthorized API access or decryption of sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Outdated Snipe-IT Version (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/4__outdated_snipe-it_version__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Outdated Snipe-IT Version (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Running an outdated version of Snipe-IT that contains known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure to a wide range of known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to various attacks like remote code execution, SQL injection, XSS, and more, depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Vulnerable Dependencies (PHP libraries, Laravel framework, JavaScript libraries) (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks used by Snipe-IT (e.g., PHP libraries, Laravel framework, JavaScript libraries).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Outdated Dependencies (High-Risk Path):** Running outdated versions of dependencies that contain known vulnerabilities. Impact depends on the specific vulnerabilities in the outdated dependencies, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, etc.
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (CVEs) (High-Risk Path):** Exploiting specific, publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in dependencies. Impact depends on the severity and exploitability of the CVEs, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, etc.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Messages (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/6__sensitive_data_exposure_in_error_messages__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Messages (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Description:**  Error messages generated by Snipe-IT inadvertently reveal sensitive information, such as database paths, internal server paths, configuration details, or even snippets of code.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, which can be used to gain a better understanding of the system's internal workings and potentially aid in crafting more targeted attacks. While not a direct compromise, it weakens the security posture and increases the likelihood of successful exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
