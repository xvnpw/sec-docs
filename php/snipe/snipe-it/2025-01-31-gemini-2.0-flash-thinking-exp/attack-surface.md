# Attack Surface Analysis for snipe/snipe-it

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input in Asset Fields](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_in_asset_fields.md)

*   **Description:**  Snipe-IT allows users to input data into various asset fields. Insufficient validation of this input can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Snipe-IT Contribution:** Snipe-IT's core asset management functionality relies on user-provided data in fields like asset names, serial numbers, notes, and custom fields.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Notes" field of an asset. When another user views this asset, the JavaScript executes in their browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS). Alternatively, malicious SQL code could be injected into a custom field if not properly sanitized, leading to SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for all asset fields.
            *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection.
            *   Employ proper output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities when displaying user-generated content.
            *   If using a template engine, ensure proper escaping of user input to prevent SSTI.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Regularly update Snipe-IT to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [CSV Import Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/csv_import_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Snipe-IT's CSV import feature, if not carefully implemented, can be vulnerable to attacks through malicious CSV files.
    *   **Snipe-IT Contribution:** Snipe-IT provides functionality to import assets and other data from CSV files, processing user-uploaded files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a CSV file with a formula like `=SYSTEM("bash -c 'rm -rf /tmp/important_files'")` embedded in a cell. If an administrator imports this CSV and opens it with vulnerable spreadsheet software, this formula could execute arbitrary commands on the administrator's machine (CSV Injection).  Furthermore, vulnerabilities in Snipe-IT's CSV parsing logic could lead to Denial of Service or potentially Remote Code Execution on the Snipe-IT server itself during the import process.
    *   **Impact:** CSV Injection leading to client-side command execution on administrator machines, File Parsing Vulnerabilities potentially leading to Denial of Service or Remote Code Execution on the Snipe-IT server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Sanitize and validate CSV data during import to neutralize potentially harmful formulas or scripts.
            *   Utilize secure and well-maintained CSV parsing libraries.
            *   Implement strict file size and type validation for uploaded CSV files.
            *   Consider sandboxing or isolating the CSV parsing process to limit potential damage from parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Only import CSV files from trusted and verified sources.
            *   Exercise extreme caution when opening CSV files exported from or intended for import into Snipe-IT in spreadsheet software, especially if the Snipe-IT instance is not fully trusted.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Functionality](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** Snipe-IT's file upload features, if not properly secured, can be exploited to upload malicious files, potentially compromising the server.
    *   **Snipe-IT Contribution:** Snipe-IT allows users to upload files for asset images, license files, and potentially other attachments, handling user-provided file uploads.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image file. If Snipe-IT's server is misconfigured to execute PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can access this web shell and execute arbitrary commands on the server, achieving Remote Code Execution (Unrestricted File Upload).
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Server Compromise, Stored XSS via file uploads, File Path Traversal leading to arbitrary file write.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict file type validation using a whitelist of allowed extensions.
            *   Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct execution by the web server.
            *   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities during storage and retrieval.
            *   Consider implementing virus scanning on uploaded files.
            *   Enforce file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks through excessive uploads.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Regularly review uploaded files and remove any suspicious or unnecessary files.
            *   Ensure proper web server configuration to prevent execution of scripts in upload directories.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in Snipe-IT's API authentication and authorization mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities.
    *   **Snipe-IT Contribution:** Snipe-IT provides an API for programmatic access to its features, requiring robust security measures for access control.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a flaw in Snipe-IT's API authentication logic that allows them to bypass authentication checks and access API endpoints without valid credentials. This could enable them to retrieve sensitive asset data, modify system configurations, or perform other unauthorized actions (API Authentication Bypass).
    *   **Impact:** Data Breaches, Unauthorized Data Manipulation, System Compromise, potentially full control over the Snipe-IT instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
