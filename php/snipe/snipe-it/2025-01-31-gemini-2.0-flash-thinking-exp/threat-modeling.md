# Threat Model Analysis for snipe/snipe-it

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via RBAC Bypass](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_rbac_bypass.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in Snipe-IT's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation could allow a user with lower privileges to bypass authorization checks and gain access to features or data intended for higher-privileged users (e.g., an editor becoming an administrator). An attacker could exploit this to gain administrative control over Snipe-IT.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of system settings, potential data breach, complete compromise of Snipe-IT instance, allowing the attacker to control asset management, user accounts, and potentially pivot to other systems.

**Affected Snipe-IT Component:** Authorization Module, RBAC System

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly review and audit Snipe-IT's RBAC configuration and code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Apply security patches and updates promptly to address known RBAC vulnerabilities.
*   Perform penetration testing specifically targeting RBAC mechanisms to identify potential bypass vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Fields](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_custom_fields.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into custom fields or asset data within Snipe-IT. When other users view this data (e.g., asset details, reports), the malicious script could execute in their browsers. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on their behalf within Snipe-IT, potentially leading to account takeover or data manipulation.

**Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), data theft, defacement of Snipe-IT interface, phishing attacks targeting Snipe-IT users, potential for wider internal network compromise if users have access to other internal systems from the same browser session.

**Affected Snipe-IT Component:** Input Handling, Custom Fields Module, Reporting Module, Asset Display

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data, especially in custom fields and asset descriptions.
*   Use output encoding (escaping) when displaying user-generated content to prevent XSS attacks.
*   Regularly scan Snipe-IT for XSS vulnerabilities using automated security scanning tools, focusing on custom field inputs and data display areas.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Custom Reporting](./threats/sql_injection_in_custom_reporting.md)

**Description:** If Snipe-IT allows users to create custom reports or queries, and these features are not properly parameterized, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code into the query input. This could allow them to bypass security checks and directly interact with the database. An attacker could read, modify, or delete sensitive data, potentially gaining full control over the Snipe-IT database.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential database server compromise, denial of service, complete loss of data integrity and confidentiality, potential for wider infrastructure compromise if the database server is poorly secured.

**Affected Snipe-IT Component:** Reporting Module, Database Interaction

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all database queries, especially those generated from user input in reporting features, are strictly parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
*   Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) securely and avoid raw SQL queries where possible, especially when dealing with user-provided input.
*   Regularly perform static and dynamic code analysis specifically targeting the reporting module to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure File Uploads](./threats/insecure_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** If Snipe-IT allows file uploads (e.g., for asset images, attachments), and file upload validation is insufficient, an attacker could upload malicious files. These files could include web shells (allowing remote command execution on the server), malware, or files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in file processing libraries used by Snipe-IT. Successful upload and execution of a web shell would grant the attacker complete control over the Snipe-IT server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, server compromise, malware distribution to users who download the files, denial of service, complete compromise of the Snipe-IT application and potentially the underlying server infrastructure.

**Affected Snipe-IT Component:** File Upload Module, Asset Management Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict file upload validation, including robust file type checking (using magic numbers, not just extensions), file size limits, and sanitization of file names.
*   Store uploaded files outside of the web root to prevent direct execution via web requests.
*   Ideally, use a dedicated and isolated file storage service.
*   Implement malware scanning on all uploaded files before storage and access.

## Threat: [Outdated Snipe-IT Version](./threats/outdated_snipe-it_version.md)

**Description:** Running an outdated version of Snipe-IT exposes the application to known and publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers can easily find and exploit these vulnerabilities using readily available exploit code or automated scanning tools. Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated software is a common and effective attack vector.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breach, denial of service, and account compromise. The impact is amplified because known vulnerabilities are easier to exploit.

**Affected Snipe-IT Component:** Entire Snipe-IT Application

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the age and severity of vulnerabilities in the outdated version)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Snipe-IT to the latest stable version, including applying security patches promptly as soon as they are released.
*   Subscribe to Snipe-IT security mailing lists, monitor the Snipe-IT GitHub repository for security announcements, and use vulnerability databases to stay informed about new vulnerabilities and updates.
*   Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely updates are applied across all Snipe-IT instances.

## Threat: [Misconfigured .env File](./threats/misconfigured__env_file.md)

**Description:** The `.env` file in Laravel applications like Snipe-IT contains highly sensitive configuration information, including database credentials, API keys, application encryption key, and other secrets. If this file is misconfigured (e.g., publicly accessible due to web server misconfiguration, world-readable permissions on the server) or contains default/weak secrets, attackers could gain access to this critical information. Access to the `.env` file is often equivalent to full application compromise.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of Snipe-IT instance, full data breach (including database access), unauthorized access to any systems integrated with Snipe-IT via API keys, ability to decrypt sensitive data, and potentially wider infrastructure compromise if database or other credentials are reused.

**Affected Snipe-IT Component:** Configuration Management, System Security

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the `.env` file is properly secured with restrictive file permissions (e.g., readable only by the web server user and root).
*   Verify web server configuration prevents direct access to `.env` file via web requests.
*   Never commit the `.env` file to version control repositories.
*   Use strong, randomly generated, and unique secrets for application keys, database passwords, and other sensitive configuration values.
*   Regularly review and audit the `.env` file for misconfigurations and exposed secrets, and ensure secrets are rotated periodically.
