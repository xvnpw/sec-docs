## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Snipe-IT Codebase [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_snipe-it_codebase__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

This represents the overarching goal of exploiting weaknesses within Snipe-IT's code. Success here often unlocks further critical attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Unsafe Deserialization:** Injecting malicious serialized objects that execute code upon deserialization by the application.
    *   **Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities:** Injecting malicious commands into input fields that are used in system commands without proper sanitization.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:** Leveraging known vulnerabilities in dependencies like Laravel to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** RCE grants the attacker complete control over the server, allowing them to steal data, install malware, or disrupt operations. It's a high-impact, though sometimes lower likelihood (depending on specific vulnerability), attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve SQL Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_sql_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Unsanitized Input in Database Queries:** Injecting malicious SQL code through input fields that are not properly sanitized before being used in database queries.
    *   **Exploit Stored SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code that is stored in the database and executed later when the data is retrieved.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Successful SQL injection can lead to the theft of sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, and in some cases, even the ability to execute operating system commands on the database server. It has a medium likelihood and high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Logic Flaws in Authentication Mechanisms:** Circumventing login procedures or password reset mechanisms due to flaws in the application's logic.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Session Management:** Stealing or hijacking user sessions to gain unauthorized access without knowing credentials.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to functionalities or data that should be restricted to higher-level users.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Successfully bypassing authentication allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users, gaining access to sensitive data and functionalities they are not authorized to use. It has a lower likelihood but a high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure File Handling [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_file_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Manipulating file paths to access sensitive files on the server's file system.
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Including and executing malicious files from remote servers (less common due to modern security practices).
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Uploading malicious files, such as web shells, that can be executed on the server.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Insecure file handling can lead to the exposure of sensitive information or, critically, the ability to upload and execute malicious code (as seen with unrestricted file uploads).

## Attack Tree Path: [Unrestricted File Upload [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/unrestricted_file_upload__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**
    *   Allowing users to upload files without proper validation, allowing the upload of malicious executable files (e.g., web shells).
*   **Why High-Risk/Critical:** This is a direct path to achieving Remote Code Execution. By uploading a web shell, an attacker can gain immediate control of the server. It has a medium likelihood and critical impact, and is often relatively easy for attackers to exploit.
