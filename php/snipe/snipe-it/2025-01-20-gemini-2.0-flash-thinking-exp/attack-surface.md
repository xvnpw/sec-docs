# Attack Surface Analysis for snipe/snipe-it

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom Fields.](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_custom_fields.md)

*   **How Snipe-IT Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Snipe-IT's functionality for creating and displaying custom fields for assets and other entities directly introduces this attack surface if input validation and output encoding are insufficient.
*   **Example:** Injecting malicious JavaScript into a custom asset field description that executes when other users view the asset.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), sensitive data theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the Snipe-IT interface for other users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for all custom field data. Utilize context-aware output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) when rendering custom field values in the user interface.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads leading to Remote Code Execution.](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **How Snipe-IT Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Snipe-IT's features allowing users to upload files (e.g., asset images, license files) create a direct pathway for attackers to upload and potentially execute malicious code if proper validation and security measures are not in place.
*   **Example:** Uploading a PHP web shell disguised as an image file through the asset image upload feature, which can then be accessed and executed by an attacker.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Snipe-IT server, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data breaches, further network attacks, and service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just extensions. Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location where script execution is disabled. Implement antivirus scanning on all uploaded files. Rename uploaded files to prevent direct execution.

## Attack Surface: [LDAP/Active Directory Integration Vulnerabilities.](./attack_surfaces/ldapactive_directory_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **How Snipe-IT Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Snipe-IT's direct integration with LDAP/AD for user authentication introduces risks if the integration is not securely implemented. This includes insecure storage of credentials or vulnerabilities in the authentication process.
*   **Example:** Snipe-IT storing LDAP bind credentials in a weakly encrypted or easily accessible configuration file, allowing an attacker to retrieve these credentials and potentially compromise the directory service.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Snipe-IT accounts, potential compromise of the entire LDAP/AD infrastructure, granting attackers control over user accounts and resources within the organization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Ensure secure storage of LDAP/AD credentials using strong encryption or a dedicated secrets management system. Implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities in the authentication process.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Key Management.](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_key_management.md)

*   **How Snipe-IT Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Snipe-IT's provision of an API and the associated generation and management of API keys directly contribute to this attack surface if keys are not handled securely.
*   **Example:** API keys being stored in plaintext in configuration files or being easily guessable, allowing unauthorized access to the Snipe-IT API and its functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Snipe-IT data and functionality, including the ability to retrieve, modify, or delete information, potentially leading to data breaches and manipulation of asset records.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Generate strong, random API keys. Store API keys securely using encryption or a secrets management system. Implement proper access controls and rate limiting for the API. Provide mechanisms for users to regenerate or revoke API keys.
