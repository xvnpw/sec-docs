**Affected Component:** Role Management module, User Permissions module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust and well-defined RBAC with clear separation of duties.
*   Enforce strict validation and authorization checks when assigning or modifying user roles and permissions.
*   Regularly audit user roles and permissions to identify and rectify any inconsistencies or misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Reset Mechanism](./threats/insecure_password_reset_mechanism.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit flaws in the password reset process to reset other users' passwords without proper authorization. This could involve predictable reset tokens, lack of proper email verification, or vulnerabilities in the password reset link generation.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized actions.

**Affected Component:** Password Reset module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Generate strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens.
*   Implement proper email verification to ensure the password reset request originates from the legitimate account owner.
*   Use HTTPS for all password reset communication.
*   Consider implementing account lockout after multiple failed password reset attempts.

## Threat: [Data Corruption through Malicious Input in Custom Fields](./threats/data_corruption_through_malicious_input_in_custom_fields.md)

**Description:** If input validation for custom fields is insufficient, attackers could inject malicious data (e.g., SQL injection payloads, malformed data) that corrupts the database or causes application errors when this data is processed.

**Impact:** Data integrity issues, potential application instability, and in severe cases, the possibility of executing arbitrary code on the database server (if SQL injection vulnerabilities exist).

**Affected Component:** Custom Fields module, Database Interaction layer.

**Risk Severity:** High (if SQL injection is possible).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all custom fields.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce data type validation for custom fields.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Backup Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_backup_files.md)

**Description:** If backup files are not properly secured (e.g., encrypted), attackers who gain access to these files could extract sensitive asset data, user credentials, and other confidential information.

**Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of user credentials, and potential compromise of the entire Snipe-IT system.

**Affected Component:** Backup and Restore module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt backup files at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
*   Securely store backup files in a location with restricted access.
*   Implement access controls for accessing and managing backup files.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through API Vulnerabilities](./threats/information_disclosure_through_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the Snipe-IT API (e.g., lack of proper authorization checks, insecure endpoints) could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities. Attackers might exploit these vulnerabilities to retrieve information they are not permitted to see.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive asset data, user information, and other confidential details.

**Affected Component:** API endpoints, Authentication and Authorization layer for the API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints.
*   Follow secure API development best practices.
