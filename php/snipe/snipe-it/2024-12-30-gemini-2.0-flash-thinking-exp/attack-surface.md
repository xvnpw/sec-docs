* **Attack Surface: Malicious Input in Custom Fields**
    * **Description:**  The ability to define custom fields for various assets, users, etc., allows for arbitrary data input. If not properly sanitized, this can lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    * **How Snipe-IT Contributes:** Snipe-IT's core functionality of allowing administrators to create flexible data fields introduces this risk if input validation and output encoding are insufficient.
    * **Example:** An attacker could create a custom field for an asset named `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`. When another user views this asset, the script would execute in their browser.
    * **Impact:**  Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all custom field inputs, both on the client-side and server-side.
        * **Developers:** Utilize output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entity encoding) when displaying custom field data to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
        * **Users/Administrators:** Educate users about the risks of entering untrusted data into custom fields.

* **Attack Surface: Unsecured File Uploads**
    * **Description:** Snipe-IT allows users to upload files as attachments to assets, user avatars, etc. Without proper validation, this can be exploited to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware).
    * **How Snipe-IT Contributes:** The file upload functionality, a core feature for managing asset information, introduces this risk if file type and content are not strictly controlled.
    * **Example:** An attacker could upload a PHP web shell disguised as a harmless image. If the web server allows execution of PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker could gain remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
        * **Developers:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location where script execution is disabled.
        * **Developers:** Implement anti-virus scanning on uploaded files.
        * **Developers:** Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.
        * **Users/Administrators:** Regularly review uploaded files for suspicious content.

* **Attack Surface: Vulnerable LDAP/SAML Integration**
    * **Description:** Snipe-IT's integration with LDAP/Active Directory and SAML for authentication can be vulnerable if not configured securely or if the underlying libraries have vulnerabilities.
    * **How Snipe-IT Contributes:**  Providing Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities through these integrations introduces potential weaknesses if the integration is not implemented correctly.
    * **Example (LDAP):**  Using weak bind credentials for LDAP integration could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the LDAP directory.
    * **Example (SAML):**  Improper certificate validation in the SAML implementation could allow an attacker to forge authentication assertions.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Snipe-IT, potential compromise of user credentials, lateral movement within the network.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Use well-vetted and up-to-date libraries for LDAP and SAML integration.
        * **Developers:** Follow security best practices for configuring LDAP and SAML integrations, including secure credential storage and proper certificate validation.
        * **Users/Administrators:** Use strong, unique bind credentials for LDAP integration.
        * **Users/Administrators:** Regularly update certificates used for SAML integration.
        * **Users/Administrators:** Securely store and manage LDAP bind credentials and SAML certificates.

* **Attack Surface: Insecure API Key Management**
    * **Description:** Snipe-IT's API allows for programmatic access. If API keys are compromised or not managed securely, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application's data and functionality.
    * **How Snipe-IT Contributes:** Providing an API for automation and integration inherently introduces the risk of key compromise if security measures are insufficient.
    * **Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public code repository. An attacker finds the key and uses it to access and modify asset data.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to application features.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement secure storage mechanisms for API keys within the application.
        * **Developers:** Allow for granular permission control for API keys (least privilege principle).
        * **Developers:** Implement API key rotation functionality.
        * **Users/Administrators:** Store API keys securely and avoid committing them to version control.
        * **Users/Administrators:** Regularly rotate API keys.
        * **Users/Administrators:** Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
