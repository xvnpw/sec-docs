*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of Custom Fields (Stored XSS)
    *   **Description:** If user-defined custom fields within Snipe-IT are not properly sanitized and escaped before being displayed, attackers could inject malicious scripts (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS). When other users view these fields within Snipe-IT, the scripts could execute in their browsers.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or theft of sensitive information from other users' browsers within the context of the Snipe-IT application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Fields Module, Data Display Components
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all custom field data within the Snipe-IT application.
        *   Use output encoding/escaping when displaying custom field data in the Snipe-IT user interface.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks within the Snipe-IT application.

*   **Threat:** LDAP/Active Directory Injection
    *   **Description:** If user-provided input within Snipe-IT is not properly sanitized before being used in LDAP or Active Directory queries, attackers could inject malicious code to manipulate the queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access or retrieving sensitive information from the connected directory service. This is a vulnerability in how Snipe-IT constructs and executes LDAP/AD queries.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and information within the connected LDAP/AD system, potentially leading to broader network compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** LDAP/Active Directory Integration Module
