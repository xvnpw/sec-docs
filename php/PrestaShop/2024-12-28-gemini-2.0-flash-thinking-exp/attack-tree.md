**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit PrestaShop Core Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Known Core Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Attackers actively scan for publicly known vulnerabilities in specific PrestaShop versions.
    *   Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often readily available, lowering the skill barrier.
    *   Unpatched installations are highly susceptible to these attacks.
*   **Exploit Logic Flaws in Core Functionality -> Exploit Insecure File Handling -> Upload Malicious Files (e.g., PHP shell) through Vulnerable Upload Forms:**
    *   Attackers identify file upload functionalities within PrestaShop that lack proper validation of file types and content.
    *   They upload malicious scripts (like PHP shells) disguised as legitimate files.
    *   Once uploaded, these scripts can be accessed to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Exploit PrestaShop Module Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Modules:**
    *   PrestaShop's extensive module ecosystem introduces vulnerabilities from third-party developers.
    *   Attackers target popular or poorly maintained modules with known or zero-day vulnerabilities.
    *   Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts depending on the flaw.
*   **Exploit PrestaShop Module Vulnerabilities -> Install Malicious Module:**
    *   Attackers trick administrators into installing malicious modules disguised as legitimate ones.
    *   This can be achieved through social engineering, compromised marketplaces, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the module installation process itself.
    *   Malicious modules can contain backdoors, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Exploit PrestaShop Configuration Weaknesses -> Exploit Insecure Default Configurations:**
    *   Administrators fail to change default settings, such as default admin credentials.
    *   Attackers exploit these well-known defaults to gain immediate access.

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Vulnerability (under Exploit Known Core Vulnerabilities):**
    *   This node represents the successful exploitation of a specific vulnerability in the PrestaShop core.
    *   Common vulnerability types include:
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise. This can be achieved through flaws like insecure deserialization or `eval()` usage.
        *   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even RCE in some cases.
        *   **Authentication Bypass:** Allows attackers to bypass the login process and gain unauthorized access to the application, often with administrative privileges. This can be due to logic flaws in the authentication mechanism or weak password reset functionalities.
*   **Upload Malicious Files (e.g., PHP shell) through Vulnerable Upload Forms:**
    *   As described in the High-Risk Paths, this node represents the successful upload of a malicious script that can be used for further exploitation.
*   **Exploit Module Vulnerability (under Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Modules):**
    *   This node represents the successful exploitation of a vulnerability within an installed PrestaShop module.
    *   Similar to core vulnerabilities, this can lead to:
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) within Module Context:** Allows attackers to execute code within the context of the vulnerable module, potentially escalating privileges or compromising the entire application.
        *   **SQL Injection within Module Database Queries:** Allows attackers to manipulate data or gain access to sensitive information managed by the module.
*   **Install Malicious Module (under Install Malicious Module):**
    *   This node signifies the successful installation of a module containing malicious code.
*   **Social Engineering Admin Credentials (under Install Malicious Module and Install Malicious Theme):**
    *   Attackers use social engineering techniques (phishing, pretexting, etc.) to trick administrators into revealing their login credentials.
    *   This provides a direct path to gaining administrative access.
*   **Use Default Admin Credentials (if not changed):**
    *   Attackers attempt to log in using the default administrator username and password, which are publicly known.
    *   If the administrator has not changed these credentials, the attacker gains immediate access.
*   **Exposed Sensitive Configuration Files (e.g., database credentials):**
    *   Configuration files containing sensitive information, such as database credentials, are unintentionally exposed to the web.
    *   Attackers can access these files and retrieve the credentials, allowing them to directly access the database and bypass application security.
