*   **Attack Surface: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Smarty**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from the improper handling of user-supplied data within Smarty templates. If user input is directly embedded into template code without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code that executes on the server.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** PrestaShop uses the Smarty templating engine extensively. If developers (in core or modules) don't properly escape or sanitize user input before passing it to Smarty for rendering, SSTI vulnerabilities can occur.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate a product review form to inject Smarty code that reads sensitive configuration files or executes arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always sanitize and escape user input before using it in Smarty templates. Utilize Smarty's built-in escaping functions. Avoid directly concatenating user input into template code. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful exploitation.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure File Uploads**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities related to the handling of file uploads, allowing attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) to the server.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** PrestaShop allows file uploads for various purposes (product images, attachments, etc.). If proper validation and sanitization are not implemented within PrestaShop's core or modules, this can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could upload a PHP web shell disguised as an image through a product image upload form, gaining remote access to the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, data breaches, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the extension within PrestaShop's upload handlers. Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible. Implement proper access controls on uploaded files. Use antivirus scanning on uploaded files.

*   **Attack Surface: SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:**  Flaws that allow attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** If developers within the PrestaShop core or module development do not properly sanitize user input before using it in database queries, SQL injection vulnerabilities can arise. This can occur in various parts of the application, such as search functionality, form processing, or API endpoints.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate a search query to extract sensitive customer data from the database by exploiting a lack of input sanitization in PrestaShop's search functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, complete database compromise, potential for remote code execution in some database configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) within PrestaShop's database interaction layers. Avoid directly embedding user input into SQL queries. Implement input validation and sanitization. Utilize PrestaShop's ORM where applicable, ensuring secure usage.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Authentication and Authorization**
    *   **Description:**  Weaknesses in the mechanisms used to verify user identities and control access to resources.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** Vulnerabilities can exist in PrestaShop's core authentication system or within modules that implement their own authentication mechanisms if not adhering to PrestaShop's security guidelines. This can include weak password policies enforced by PrestaShop, insecure session management practices within the core, or flaws in access control logic within PrestaShop's permission system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could brute-force weak admin credentials due to insufficient password complexity requirements enforced by PrestaShop, or exploit a session fixation vulnerability in PrestaShop's session handling to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies within PrestaShop's user management. Use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) as implemented by PrestaShop. Implement secure session management practices (e.g., HTTPOnly and Secure flags for cookies, session regeneration) following PrestaShop's guidelines. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning user roles and permissions within PrestaShop's backend. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts within PrestaShop.

*   **Attack Surface: API Vulnerabilities (Webservice)**
    *   **Description:** Security flaws in the PrestaShop Webservice API, which allows external applications to interact with the platform.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** The PrestaShop Webservice provides a powerful interface, and vulnerabilities can arise from improper authentication mechanisms provided by PrestaShop, insufficient authorization checks within the API endpoints defined by PrestaShop, or lack of input validation and output encoding in the API endpoints provided by PrestaShop.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit an API endpoint with insufficient authentication provided by PrestaShop to retrieve sensitive customer data or manipulate product information.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access (e.g., OAuth 2.0) as recommended by PrestaShop. Carefully validate and sanitize all input received through the API endpoints defined by PrestaShop. Securely handle API keys and secrets as per PrestaShop's security recommendations. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the PrestaShop API.
