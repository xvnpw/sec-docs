### High and Critical Parse Server Threats

*   **Threat:** Master Key Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `masterKey`. This could happen through various means such as finding it hardcoded in the codebase, exposed in configuration files managed by Parse Server, or through a vulnerability in Parse Server's configuration handling. With the `masterKey`, the attacker can bypass all authentication and authorization checks within Parse Server. They can then read, modify, or delete any data in the Parse Server database, create new administrative users within Parse Server, or even shut down the service.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, service disruption, full administrative control over the Parse Server instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core authentication and authorization system of Parse Server, specifically the `masterKey` configuration and handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode the `masterKey` in the codebase.
        *   Store the `masterKey` securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system, ensuring Parse Server reads it from a secure source.
        *   Restrict access to the server and configuration files where the `masterKey` is stored, focusing on how Parse Server accesses this information.
        *   Regularly rotate the `masterKey`.

*   **Threat:** Cloud Code Injection/Remote Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom Cloud Code functions, potentially through improper input validation within the Cloud Code logic executed by Parse Server or insecure use of external libraries called from Cloud Code. This could allow them to inject malicious code that gets executed within the Parse Server's environment. They might be able to read sensitive data managed by Parse Server, modify data within the Parse Server database, or even execute arbitrary system commands on the server where Parse Server is running.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation within Parse Server, privilege escalation within the Parse Server environment, server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cloud Code execution environment provided by Parse Server, specific Cloud Code functions with vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs within Cloud Code functions.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when writing Cloud Code that runs within the Parse Server environment.
        *   Regularly review and audit Cloud Code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep dependencies and libraries used in Cloud Code up to date.
        *   Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information from Cloud Code execution.
        *   Restrict the permissions of the Parse Server process to the minimum necessary.

*   **Threat:** NoSQL Injection (MongoDB Specific)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used in database queries within Cloud Code or through the Parse Server API, manipulates the query logic executed by Parse Server against the underlying MongoDB database. This allows them to bypass security checks implemented within Parse Server and access or modify data they are not authorized to. They might be able to retrieve sensitive data managed by Parse Server, modify existing records in the Parse Server database, or even delete data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches within the Parse Server database, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by Parse Server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database query processing within Cloud Code and the Parse Server API, specifically when handling user-provided input in queries processed by Parse Server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing raw database queries with user-provided input within Cloud Code or through direct API calls.
        *   Utilize Parse Server's built-in query constraints and operators.
        *   Be cautious when using `$where` clauses or other potentially unsafe operators in queries processed by Parse Server.
        *   Implement strict input validation on data used in database queries handled by Parse Server.

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Storage Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to files stored through Parse Server's file storage mechanism (e.g., AWS S3, GridFS). This could happen due to misconfigured access controls on the storage backend *as configured by Parse Server* or vulnerabilities in how Parse Server handles file permissions and access. The attacker could download sensitive files managed by Parse Server, modify existing files managed by Parse Server, or upload malicious files through the Parse Server file API.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches of files managed by Parse Server, data manipulation of files, introduction of malware through the file storage.
    *   **Affected Component:** File API provided by Parse Server, interaction of Parse Server with the underlying file storage backend.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure strict access control policies on the underlying file storage backend, ensuring Parse Server's configuration enforces these policies.
        *   Ensure that files are not publicly accessible by default through Parse Server's configuration.
        *   Implement proper authentication and authorization checks within Parse Server before allowing file access.
        *   Regularly review and audit file storage permissions configured within Parse Server.
        *   Consider using signed URLs with limited validity for accessing files through Parse Server.
