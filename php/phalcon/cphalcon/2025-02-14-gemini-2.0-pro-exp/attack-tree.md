## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Buffer Overflows](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_buffer_overflows.md)

*   **Description:** Buffer overflows occur when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated size of a buffer.  In Phalcon's C code, this could happen in functions that handle strings, arrays, or user-supplied input without proper bounds checking.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **1.1.1.1 Identify vulnerable functions:** The attacker analyzes Phalcon's C source code to find functions that are susceptible to buffer overflows. This requires expertise in C programming and security auditing.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Advanced/Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium/Hard
    *   **1.1.1.1.1 Craft malicious input:** The attacker creates specially crafted input (e.g., an overly long string) that, when processed by the vulnerable function, overwrites adjacent memory.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Advanced/Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium/Hard
    *   **1.1.1.1.1.1 Control overwritten memory:** The attacker carefully designs the malicious input to overwrite specific memory locations, such as the return address on the stack or function pointers, to redirect program execution.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Advanced/Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium/Hard
    *   **1.1.1.1.1.1.1 Achieve RCE [CRITICAL]:** By controlling the program's execution flow, the attacker can jump to attacker-controlled code (shellcode) injected into memory, achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Advanced/Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium/Hard
*   **Fuzzing Path (1.1.1.2):**
    *   **Description:** Fuzzing is an automated technique for finding vulnerabilities by providing a program with a large amount of invalid, unexpected, or random data.
    *   **1.1.1.2.1 Automate fuzzing:** The attacker uses fuzzing tools (AFL++, libFuzzer, etc.) to automatically generate and send malformed input to Phalcon's API endpoints and internal functions.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Use-After-Free](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_use-after-free.md)

*   **Description:** Use-after-free vulnerabilities occur when a program attempts to use memory that has already been freed.  This can happen if Phalcon objects are prematurely deallocated but pointers to those objects are still used.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **1.1.2.1 Identify scenarios:** The attacker analyzes Phalcon's code to find situations where objects might be freed prematurely and their memory accessed later. This requires a deep understanding of Phalcon's object lifecycle management.
        *   Likelihood: Low/Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Very High
        *   Skill Level: Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard/Very Hard
    *   **1.1.2.1.1 Craft input/operations:** The attacker crafts input or a sequence of operations that triggers the premature deallocation of a Phalcon object.
        *   Likelihood: Low/Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Very High
        *   Skill Level: Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard/Very Hard
    *   **1.1.2.1.1.1 Exploit dangling pointer:** The attacker exploits the dangling pointer (a pointer to freed memory) to read or write arbitrary memory locations.
        *   Likelihood: Low/Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Very High
        *   Skill Level: Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard/Very Hard
    *   **1.1.2.1.1.1.1 Achieve RCE or data exfiltration [CRITICAL]:** By controlling the memory pointed to by the dangling pointer, the attacker can achieve RCE or exfiltrate sensitive data.
        *   Likelihood: Low/Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Very High
        *   Skill Level: Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard/Very Hard
