# Attack Surface Analysis for phalcon/cphalcon

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via ORM](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_orm.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.

**How cphalcon Contributes:** Improper use of Phalcon's ORM, particularly when constructing raw SQL queries or using the query builder without proper parameter binding, can introduce this vulnerability.

**Example:**  `$app->modelsManager->executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $request->get('username') . "'");`  If `$request->get('username')` contains `' OR '1'='1`, it bypasses authentication.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential for remote code execution in some database configurations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements: Phalcon's ORM supports this.
*   Utilize Phalcon's query builder with proper binding: This automatically handles escaping.
*   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user input.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Volt](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_volt.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**How cphalcon Contributes:** If user-controlled data is directly embedded into Volt templates without proper escaping or sanitization, it can lead to SSTI.

**Example:**  `{{ user.name }}` in a Volt template where `user.name` comes directly from user input and contains `{{ dump(app) }}` could expose sensitive application information. More dangerous payloads could lead to code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data exfiltration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always escape output in Volt templates: Use appropriate filters like `e()` or `escape()`.
*   Avoid passing raw user input directly to template variables. Sanitize and validate data before rendering.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Volt](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_volt.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**How cphalcon Contributes:** Failure to properly escape output within Volt templates allows attackers to inject JavaScript or other client-side scripts.

**Example:**  Displaying user-provided comments without escaping: `{{ comment.text }}`. If `comment.text` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the script will execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Account hijacking, session theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always escape output in Volt templates: Use appropriate filters like `e()` or specific escaping functions for different contexts (HTML, JavaScript, URL).
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP): Helps to mitigate XSS by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization of Session Data](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_of_session_data.md)

**Description:** Attackers provide malicious serialized data that, when unserialized by the application, leads to code execution or other vulnerabilities.

**How cphalcon Contributes:** If Phalcon's session handling relies on `unserialize()` without proper validation of the session data source or integrity checks, it can be vulnerable. This is more likely if using file-based or database session storage without encryption or signing.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object and sets it as the session cookie. When Phalcon unserializes this data, it triggers a magic method (`__wakeup`, `__destruct`) in a vulnerable class, leading to code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use secure session storage mechanisms: Consider using database or Redis with encryption and integrity checks.
*   Implement session data signing or encryption: Phalcon provides options for this.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers can modify unintended database columns by including extra data in requests when creating or updating model instances.

**How cphalcon Contributes:** If Phalcon models are configured to allow mass assignment without explicitly defining which fields are fillable (using `$fillable` or `$allowedFields`), attackers can potentially modify sensitive attributes.

**Example:**  A user registration form sends extra data like `is_admin=1`. If the `User` model doesn't restrict fillable fields, an attacker could potentially grant themselves administrative privileges.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly define fillable fields in your Phalcon models: Use the `$fillable` property to specify which attributes can be mass-assigned.
*   Use the `$allowedFields` property for stricter control.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Phalcon Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_phalcon_extensions.md)

**Description:** Bugs or security flaws within specific Phalcon extensions (written in Zephir or C) can introduce vulnerabilities.

**How cphalcon Contributes:** If the application utilizes extensions with security flaws, those flaws become part of the application's attack surface.

**Example:** A vulnerable version of a caching extension might allow an attacker to bypass cache restrictions or inject malicious data into the cache.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Phalcon and its extensions up-to-date: Regularly update to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Carefully evaluate the security of third-party extensions before using them.
*   Monitor security advisories for Phalcon and its extensions.
