# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, cphalcon, represents the core C extension for the Phalcon PHP framework. Phalcon is designed to be a high-performance web framework for PHP, offering features like routing, templating, ORM, and security components. The primary business goal of Phalcon is to provide PHP developers with a fast, secure, and feature-rich framework to build web applications efficiently.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- High Performance: Deliver exceptional speed and low resource consumption for PHP applications.
- Feature Richness: Offer a comprehensive set of components and tools for web development.
- Security: Ensure the framework is secure and provides tools for developers to build secure applications.
- Developer Experience: Provide a user-friendly and efficient development experience.
- Community Growth: Foster a strong and active community of users and contributors.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Security Vulnerabilities: Critical vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to widespread security breaches in applications built with Phalcon, damaging reputation and user trust.
- Performance Degradation: If performance is not maintained or degrades, developers may choose alternative frameworks.
- Lack of Adoption: If the framework fails to attract a sufficient user base, it may become unsustainable.
- Compatibility Issues: Incompatibilities with new PHP versions or other technologies could limit adoption and require significant rework.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Community Security Reporting -  Users and developers can report security issues through GitHub issues or dedicated channels. Implemented in: GitHub repository, community forums.
- security control: Standard Development Practices -  Likely using standard software development practices, although specifics are not detailed in the input. Implemented in: Development process (assumed).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community for Security Audits - Security audits are largely dependent on community contributions and may not be as frequent or comprehensive as dedicated professional audits.
- accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure - Public disclosure of vulnerabilities before patches are widely adopted could be exploited.

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code during development.
- recommended security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the framework.
- recommended security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses.
- recommended security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
- recommended security control: Bug Bounty Program - Establish a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: The framework should provide secure and flexible authentication components for applications built with Phalcon.
    - security requirement: Support for various authentication methods (e.g., session-based, token-based, OAuth).
    - security requirement: Protection against common authentication attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: The framework should provide robust authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and functionalities within applications.
    - security requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) support.
    - security requirement: Fine-grained permission management capabilities.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: The framework must encourage and facilitate secure input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
    - security requirement: Provide built-in input validation components and guidelines for developers.
    - security requirement: Default-safe input handling practices.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: The framework should provide secure cryptographic functions and libraries for developers to use when implementing security features.
    - security requirement: Support for secure hashing algorithms, encryption methods, and random number generation.
    - security requirement: Guidance on proper cryptographic key management and secure storage.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code on their workstation and commits changes to the source code repository (GitHub).
2. Code commit to the version control system (Git on GitHub) triggers the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. Build automation system (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows) starts the build process.
4. Build automation compiles the C extension and builds the PHP userland library.
5. Security scanning tools (SAST, dependency checkers) are executed to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
6. Unit tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
7. Package building process creates distributable packages (e.g., for Packagist, GitHub Releases).
8. Build artifacts (packages) are stored in an artifact repository.
9. Packages are released to package managers like Packagist and GitHub Releases for consumption by PHP developers.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Version Control (Git) -  Track code changes, enabling auditability and rollback capabilities. Implemented in: GitHub.
- security control: Build Automation - Automate the build process to ensure consistency and repeatability, reducing manual errors. Implemented in: GitHub Actions.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Automatically scan source code for potential security vulnerabilities during the build process. Implemented in: CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using tools like SonarQube, CodeQL).
- security control: Dependency Scanning - Automatically check dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Implemented in: CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check).
- security control: Unit Testing - Ensure code quality and functionality, indirectly contributing to security by reducing bugs. Implemented in: CI/CD pipeline (e.g., PHPUnit).
- security control: Secure Compilation Flags - Use secure compiler flags during the C extension compilation to mitigate certain types of vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows). Implemented in: Build automation scripts.
- security control: Code Signing (for releases) - Sign release packages to ensure integrity and authenticity. Implemented in: Release process (potentially).
- security control: Access Control to CI/CD Pipeline - Restrict access to the CI/CD pipeline to authorized personnel to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build process. Implemented in: GitHub Actions permissions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:
- Secure execution of PHP applications built with Phalcon.
- Availability and performance of PHP applications built with Phalcon.
- Integrity of the Phalcon framework code and releases.
- Reputation and trust in the Phalcon project.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Source Code (cphalcon repository): Publicly available, but integrity is important to prevent malicious modifications. Sensitivity: Low to Medium (integrity is key).
- Compiled Binaries (C extension releases): More sensitive as these are directly executed. Integrity and availability are crucial. Sensitivity: Medium to High.
- Framework Configuration: Default configurations should be secure. Sensitivity: Medium.
- User Data in Applications Built with Phalcon: Highly sensitive, but responsibility primarily lies with application developers. Phalcon should provide tools to help secure this data. Sensitivity: High (application developer responsibility).
