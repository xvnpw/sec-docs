## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Phalcon Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_phalcon_vulnerability.md)

* Description: The ultimate goal of the attacker is to gain unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting weaknesses within the Phalcon framework.
    * Likelihood: N/A (Goal)
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: Varies
    * Skill Level: Varies
    * Detection Difficulty: Varies

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* Bypass Input Validation [CRITICAL NODE]:
    * Description: Attacker crafts malicious input that circumvents Phalcon's input sanitization or validation, allowing for the injection of harmful data.
    * Phalcon Relevance: Weak or improperly configured filters within Phalcon's `Request` object can be exploited.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium (Can escalate to higher impact vulnerabilities)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
  * Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using Phalcon's Session/Cache with serialization) [CRITICAL NODE]:
    * Description: Attacker injects malicious serialized data into session or cache storage. When Phalcon unserializes this data, it leads to arbitrary code execution.
    * Phalcon Relevance: Using PHP's native serialization with Phalcon's session or cache handlers makes the application vulnerable.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical (Remote Code Execution)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Medium/High
    * Detection Difficulty: Low/Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_input_validation.md)

* Description: Attacker crafts malicious input that circumvents Phalcon's input sanitization or validation, allowing for the injection of harmful data.
    * Phalcon Relevance: Weak or improperly configured filters within Phalcon's `Request` object can be exploited.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium (Can escalate to higher impact vulnerabilities)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using Phalcon's Session/Cache with serialization)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_using_phalcon's_sessioncache_with_serialization_.md)

* Description: Attacker injects malicious serialized data into session or cache storage. When Phalcon unserializes this data, it leads to arbitrary code execution.
    * Phalcon Relevance: Using PHP's native serialization with Phalcon's session or cache handlers makes the application vulnerable.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical (Remote Code Execution)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Medium/High
    * Detection Difficulty: Low/Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Phalcon's ORM (Volt/Database Interaction)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phalcon's_orm__voltdatabase_interaction_.md)

* Insecure Query Construction (leading to SQL Injection via ORM) [CRITICAL NODE]:
    * Description: Attacker manipulates input that is used to construct database queries through Phalcon's ORM, leading to unintended SQL execution.
    * Phalcon Relevance: Improper use of raw SQL within the ORM or insufficient sanitization when using query builders can create this vulnerability.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Database Compromise)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Medium
    * Detection Difficulty: Low/Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Query Construction (leading to SQL Injection via ORM)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_query_construction__leading_to_sql_injection_via_orm_.md)

* Description: Attacker manipulates input that is used to construct database queries through Phalcon's ORM, leading to unintended SQL execution.
    * Phalcon Relevance: Improper use of raw SQL within the ORM or insufficient sanitization when using query builders can create this vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Phalcon's View/Templating Engine (Volt)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phalcon's_viewtemplating_engine__volt_.md)

* Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]:
    * Description: Attacker injects malicious code into template inputs, which is then executed on the server by Phalcon's Volt templating engine.
    * Phalcon Relevance: Passing unsanitized user-provided data directly to Volt templates without proper escaping makes the application vulnerable.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical (Remote Code Execution)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Medium/High
    * Detection Difficulty: Low/Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

* Description: Attacker injects malicious code into template inputs, which is then executed on the server by Phalcon's Volt templating engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Phalcon's File Handling/Uploads](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phalcon's_file_handlinguploads.md)

* Unrestricted File Upload [CRITICAL NODE]:
    * Description: Attacker uploads malicious files (like web shells) to the server due to a lack of proper validation on file types, sizes, and content.
    * Phalcon Relevance: Insufficient validation when handling file uploads through Phalcon's `Request` object creates this vulnerability.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical (Remote Code Execution, System Takeover)

    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low/Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying C Extension Vulnerabilities (Less Common, but Potential)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_c_extension_vulnerabilities__less_common__but_potential_.md)

* Memory Corruption/Buffer Overflows [CRITICAL NODE]:
        * Description: Attacker triggers memory corruption or buffer overflows within the cphalcon extension itself, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
