# Attack Surface Analysis for phalcon/cphalcon

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization of Session Data](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization_of_session_data.md)

*   **Description:**  If Phalcon's session handling relies on serializing PHP objects and user-controlled data influences the session content, attackers can inject malicious serialized objects. When unserialized, these objects can execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How cphalcon Contributes:** Phalcon's default session handling might use PHP's built-in serialization. If developers don't sanitize or validate data before storing it in the session, or if they use custom session handlers without proper security measures, this vulnerability can arise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a cookie value that gets unserialized by Phalcon's session handler, injecting a malicious object that executes system commands.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to fully compromise the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive or executable data directly in session variables.
        *   Use signed and encrypted session data to prevent tampering.
        *   Consider using alternative session storage mechanisms that don't rely on PHP's native serialization (e.g., database sessions with proper sanitization).
        *   Implement strict input validation for any data influencing session content.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Volt](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_volt.md)

*   **Description:** When user-controlled data is directly embedded into Volt templates without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious Volt code. This code is then executed on the server, potentially leading to RCE.
    *   **How cphalcon Contributes:** Phalcon's Volt templating engine allows for powerful expressions. If developers directly output user input without using Volt's escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{ variable | e }}`), it creates an SSTI vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A comment form allows users to input Volt syntax like `{{ phpversion() }}` which, if not escaped, will execute the `phpversion()` function on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure, Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data when outputting it in Volt templates using the appropriate filters (e.g., `e` for HTML escaping, `urlencode`, etc.).
        *   Avoid allowing users to control template paths or includes directly.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed or restricted execution environment for template rendering if dynamic template generation is necessary.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Raw SQL Queries or ORM Misuse](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_raw_sql_queries_or_orm_misuse.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into database queries, allowing them to bypass security controls, access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   **How cphalcon Contributes:** While Phalcon's ORM provides some protection, developers can still write raw SQL queries. Improper use of the ORM, such as directly embedding user input into query builders or using unescaped values in `WHERE` clauses, can also lead to SQL injection.
    *   **Example:**  A search functionality uses raw SQL and directly concatenates user input: `$app->db->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_GET['username'] . "'");`. An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Account Takeover, Potential Remote Code Execution (depending on database privileges).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for raw SQL.**
        *   **Utilize Phalcon's ORM and its built-in escaping mechanisms.**
        *   **Avoid directly embedding user input into query builders.**
        *   **Implement proper input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it in database queries.**
        *   **Follow the principle of least privilege for database user accounts.**

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Insecure Output Handling](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_insecure_output_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser.
    *   **How cphalcon Contributes:** If developers don't consistently use Phalcon's output escaping mechanisms in Volt templates when displaying user-generated content, XSS vulnerabilities can occur.
    *   **Example:** A blog comment section allows users to input HTML. If these comments are displayed without escaping, an attacker can inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    *   **Impact:** Account Hijacking, Data Theft, Website Defacement, Redirection to Malicious Sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always escape user-provided data when outputting it in Volt templates using appropriate filters (e.g., `{{ variable | e }}`).**
        *   **Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.**
        *   **Implement proper input validation and sanitization to remove or neutralize potentially malicious scripts before storing data.**
        *   **Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies to mitigate cookie theft.**

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) if Token Generation/Validation is Flawed](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__if_token_generationvalidation_is_flawed.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on a web application. This is typically done by embedding malicious requests in emails or on other websites.
    *   **How cphalcon Contributes:** Phalcon provides built-in CSRF protection mechanisms. However, if these mechanisms are not implemented correctly or if developers create custom CSRF protection that is flawed, the application remains vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by an authenticated user, submits a form to change the user's password without their knowledge.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized Actions, Data Modification, Account Takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize Phalcon's built-in CSRF protection features and ensure they are correctly implemented for all state-changing requests (e.g., form submissions, AJAX requests).**
        *   **Synchronize tokens correctly between the server and the client.**
        *   **Validate the CSRF token on the server for each state-changing request.**
        *   **Consider using the `SameSite` cookie attribute to further mitigate CSRF attacks.**
