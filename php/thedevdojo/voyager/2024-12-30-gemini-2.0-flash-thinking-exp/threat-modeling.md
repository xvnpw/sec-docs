### High and Critical Voyager-Specific Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical security threats directly involving the Voyager admin panel:

*   **Threat:** Default Credentials Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Voyager admin panel using default credentials (e.g., `admin:password`). If successful, the attacker gains full administrative access to Voyager.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and its data managed through Voyager. The attacker can modify data, create new users within Voyager, delete information managed by Voyager, and potentially leverage Voyager's features to impact the underlying system.
    *   **Affected Voyager Component:** Authentication module, specifically the login functionality provided by Voyager.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the default administrator username and password during the initial setup of Voyager.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all admin accounts within Voyager.

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection through BREAD Functionality
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them through input fields within Voyager's BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) interface. This can occur if the dynamically generated SQL queries within Voyager are not properly sanitized or parameterized. The attacker can then manipulate the database, potentially extracting sensitive data, modifying records managed by Voyager, or even impacting the underlying database schema.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach of information managed by Voyager, data manipulation within Voyager's scope, data loss related to Voyager's data, potential for privilege escalation if the database user used by Voyager has excessive permissions.
    *   **Affected Voyager Component:** BREAD controller logic within Voyager, specifically the functions responsible for generating and executing database queries for BREAD operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all database interactions within Voyager's BREAD functionality use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data within Voyager's BREAD interface.
        *   Regularly audit the generated SQL queries within Voyager's BREAD functionality for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Unrestricted File Upload in Media Manager
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., PHP web shells, executable files) through Voyager's media manager due to insufficient file type validation or size restrictions within Voyager's upload handling. If the uploaded files are accessible through the web server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the application using Voyager, server compromise, potential for further attacks on the infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Voyager Component:** Media Manager module within Voyager, specifically the file upload functionality provided by Voyager.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not just file extensions within Voyager's media manager.
        *   Enforce file size limits for uploads through Voyager's media manager.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism that prevents direct execution, ensuring Voyager's configuration respects these security measures.
        *   Sanitize file names within Voyager's media manager to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** PHP Code Injection through Settings or Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker with administrative access to Voyager (or through an exploit granting such access) manipulates settings or configuration options within Voyager that allow for the direct input or interpretation of PHP code. This could be through poorly secured custom code areas within Voyager or vulnerable configuration fields exposed by Voyager. The attacker can then execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, complete control over the application and server.
    *   **Affected Voyager Component:** Settings module within Voyager, potentially custom code areas or any configuration fields within Voyager that process or interpret code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing direct PHP code input in Voyager's settings or configuration.
        *   If custom code functionality is necessary within Voyager, implement strict sandboxing and security checks.
        *   Enforce proper input validation and sanitization for all configuration values within Voyager.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials used by Voyager, API keys configured within Voyager, or other secrets relevant to Voyager's operation, is stored insecurely within Voyager's configuration files or environment variables. An attacker gaining access to the server's file system or through other vulnerabilities could potentially retrieve this information.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the database used by Voyager or other connected services configured within Voyager, potential for further attacks using exposed credentials.
    *   **Affected Voyager Component:** Voyager's configuration management, environment variable handling specific to Voyager.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Voyager's configuration files.
        *   Utilize secure methods for managing secrets, such as environment variables or dedicated secret management tools, ensuring Voyager is configured to use these securely.
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions are in place to restrict access to Voyager's configuration files.
