## High-Risk Sub-Tree: Compromising Application via Voyager

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized control or significantly disrupt the application utilizing the Voyager admin panel.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Voyager **[CRITICAL]**
    * Gain Unauthorized Access to Voyager Admin Panel **[CRITICAL]**
        * Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities
            * Brute-force Login Credentials
            * Exploit Default Credentials
        * Session Hijacking (e.g., XSS leading to cookie theft)
    * Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server **[CRITICAL]**
        * Exploit Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability
            * Upload Malicious PHP Script
            * Upload Web Shell
        * Exploit Insecure Code Editor (if enabled)
            * Inject Malicious Code Directly
            * Modify Critical Application Files
    * Manipulate Application Data and Configuration
        * Modify User Roles and Permissions
            * Grant Attacker Elevated Privileges

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application via Voyager [CRITICAL]:**

* This is the ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has achieved significant control over the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further attacks on connected systems.

**2. Gain Unauthorized Access to Voyager Admin Panel [CRITICAL]:**

* **Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Brute-force Login Credentials:** The attacker attempts numerous username and password combinations to guess valid credentials. This can be automated using readily available tools. Weak or commonly used passwords increase the likelihood of success.
    * **Exploit Default Credentials:** The attacker tries using default usernames and passwords that are often set during the initial installation of Voyager or are common across many installations. If administrators fail to change these, access is easily gained.
* **Session Hijacking (e.g., XSS leading to cookie theft):**
    * The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) into a page within the Voyager admin panel or a related part of the application. When an administrator views this page, the script executes in their browser. This script can steal the administrator's session cookie, allowing the attacker to impersonate the administrator without needing their login credentials.

**3. Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL]:**

* **Exploit Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability:**
    * **Upload Malicious PHP Script:** Voyager's file upload functionality (often used for media management) lacks proper restrictions on file types. The attacker uploads a PHP script containing malicious code. When this script is accessed (either directly or indirectly), the code is executed on the server, granting the attacker control.
    * **Upload Web Shell:**  Similar to uploading a malicious PHP script, a web shell is a small script that provides a command-line interface accessible through a web browser. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, manage files, and potentially pivot to other systems.
* **Exploit Insecure Code Editor (if enabled):**
    * **Inject Malicious Code Directly:** If Voyager has an integrated code editor enabled (especially in a production environment), the attacker, once authenticated, can directly modify application files. They can inject malicious code into existing scripts or create new ones.
    * **Modify Critical Application Files:** Using the code editor, the attacker can alter core application files, configuration files, or even Voyager's own files to inject backdoors, disable security features, or manipulate application logic.

**4. Manipulate Application Data and Configuration:**

* **Modify User Roles and Permissions:**
    * **Grant Attacker Elevated Privileges:** Once authenticated (even with low-level access if there are authorization flaws), the attacker uses Voyager's user management features to modify their own user role or permissions, granting themselves administrative privileges. This allows them to bypass access controls and perform actions they were not originally authorized for.

These High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes represent the most significant threats introduced by Voyager. Addressing the vulnerabilities associated with these attack vectors should be the top priority for the development team.
