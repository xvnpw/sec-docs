### Key Voyager Attack Surface List (High & Critical - Voyager Specific)

This list focuses on high and critical attack surfaces directly involving the Voyager admin package.

*   **Attack Surface: Weak Default Credentials**
    *   **Description:**  The application uses default, well-known credentials for the initial administrator account.
    *   **How Voyager Contributes:** Voyager sets up a default administrator account during installation. If the installer doesn't force a password change or users neglect to do so, these default credentials become a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default username "admin" and password "password" (or similar common defaults) to log into the Voyager admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the administrative interface, allowing attackers to control the application's data, settings, and potentially the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Force a strong password change during the initial Voyager installation process.
        *   Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Consider removing or disabling the default account after a secure administrator account is created.

*   **Attack Surface: Unrestricted File Uploads in Media Manager**
    *   **Description:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation of file types or content.
    *   **How Voyager Contributes:** Voyager's Media Manager provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and managing files. If not configured correctly, it can allow the upload of arbitrary file types.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image or another seemingly harmless file. This script can then be accessed directly to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to gain full control of the server, steal data, or launch further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on file extensions and MIME types within Voyager's configuration or custom logic.
        *   Use a file scanning service or library to detect malicious content within uploaded files, integrating this into the Voyager upload process.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions, ensuring Voyager's configuration respects these restrictions.
        *   Rename uploaded files to prevent direct execution, a practice that should be enforced by Voyager's upload handling.

*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Voyager UI**
    *   **Description:** The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the web interface, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **How Voyager Contributes:** Voyager's admin panel involves various input fields (e.g., for creating posts, categories, menu items, settings). If these inputs are not properly sanitized by Voyager's code, attackers can inject XSS payloads.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Name" field of a new category within Voyager. When an administrator views the category list in Voyager, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover of administrators, defacement of the admin panel, or redirection of administrators to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided data within Voyager's admin interface, potentially through custom middleware or modifications to Voyager's controllers and views.
        *   Utilize templating engines that provide automatic escaping by default, ensuring Voyager's Blade templates leverage this feature correctly.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, configuring this in the application's headers which will affect Voyager's UI.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Voyager Routes**
    *   **Description:** The application exposes internal object IDs in URLs without proper authorization checks, allowing attackers to access resources they shouldn't.
    *   **How Voyager Contributes:** Voyager uses IDs in URLs to identify specific resources (e.g., editing a user with `/admin/users/1/edit`). If Voyager's route definitions or controller logic lack sufficient authorization checks, attackers might be able to manipulate the IDs.
    *   **Example:** An attacker guesses or enumerates user IDs and modifies the URL to access or edit another user's profile through Voyager's admin interface without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data belonging to other users, or privilege escalation within the Voyager admin panel.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper authorization checks on all Voyager routes that access specific resources, leveraging Voyager's permission system or custom middleware.
        *   Avoid exposing internal IDs directly in URLs within Voyager's routing structure. Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers for resources managed by Voyager.
        *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) to manage permissions for accessing specific resources within Voyager's functionality.
