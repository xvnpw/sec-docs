# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for thedevdojo/voyager

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strengthen Default Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/strengthen_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Access the Voyager admin panel login page (usually `/admin`).
    *   Step 2: Log in using the default username (often `admin@admin.com`) and password (`password`).
    *   Step 3: Navigate to the "Users" section within the Voyager admin panel.
    *   Step 4: Locate and edit the default administrator user account.
    *   Step 5: Change the username to a less predictable value, avoiding common names like "admin" or "administrator".
    *   Step 6: Generate a strong, unique password that meets complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, mixed case, special characters). Use a password manager if needed.
    *   Step 7: Update the user profile with the new username and password.
    *   Step 8:  If multiple default accounts exist, repeat steps 4-7 for each.
    *   Step 9:  Communicate the new credentials securely to authorized administrators.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Default Credential Exploitation (High Severity): Attackers can easily gain unauthorized access to the admin panel by using well-known default credentials, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Default Credential Exploitation: High risk reduction. Eliminates the most basic and easily exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Password policy enforced during user creation, but default credentials might still be in use on initial Voyager setup. Implemented in user management module.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automatic forced password change upon first login for default accounts. Script to automatically reset default credentials during deployment process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Choose an MFA method (e.g., TOTP using Google Authenticator, Authy, or SMS-based OTP). TOTP is recommended for better security.
    *   Step 2: Install a Laravel MFA package (e.g., `pragmarx/google2fa-laravel` for TOTP).
    *   Step 3: Configure the chosen MFA package according to its documentation. This usually involves publishing configuration files and potentially database migrations.
    *   Step 4: Modify the Voyager login process to integrate MFA. This might involve:
        *   Adding an MFA setup step after initial login.
        *   Adding an MFA verification step during subsequent logins.
        *   Customizing the Voyager login controller or using provided extension points by the MFA package.
    *   Step 5: Enable MFA for all administrator user roles within Voyager.
    *   Step 6: Provide clear instructions to administrators on how to set up and use MFA for their Voyager accounts.
    *   Step 7: Test the MFA implementation thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and doesn't introduce usability issues within the Voyager admin panel.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity): MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the Voyager admin panel even if passwords are compromised.
    *   Phishing Attacks (Medium Severity): MFA adds an extra layer of protection against phishing attacks targeting Voyager admin logins.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks: High risk reduction. Makes these attacks against Voyager admin logins significantly more difficult.
    *   Phishing Attacks: Medium risk reduction. Increases the difficulty for attackers targeting Voyager logins but doesn't completely eliminate the risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. MFA is not currently enabled for the Voyager admin panel.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration of MFA into the Voyager login flow. Configuration and deployment of an MFA package for Voyager. User documentation for MFA setup for Voyager admins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Roles and Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege)](./mitigation_strategies/customize_roles_and_permissions__principle_of_least_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Access the "Roles" and "Permissions" sections within the Voyager admin panel.
    *   Step 2: Review the default roles provided by Voyager (Administrator, User, etc.). Understand the permissions assigned to each role within the Voyager context.
    *   Step 3: Identify the specific administrative tasks required for different user groups *within Voyager* in your project.
    *   Step 4: Create new roles *within Voyager* that align with these specific tasks (e.g., "Content Editor", "User Manager", "Developer").
    *   Step 5: For each *Voyager* role, carefully assign only the necessary permissions. Deny permissions that are not required for the role's function within Voyager.
    *   Step 6: Remove unnecessary permissions from default *Voyager* roles if they are too broad.
    *   Step 7: Assign users to the most restrictive *Voyager* role that still allows them to perform their duties within the admin panel.
    *   Step 8: Regularly review and adjust *Voyager* roles and permissions as user responsibilities or application requirements change within the admin panel.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium to High Severity): Limits the potential damage from compromised Voyager admin accounts by ensuring users only have access to necessary functions within Voyager.
    *   Insider Threats (Medium Severity): Reduces the potential impact of malicious insiders with Voyager admin access by limiting their capabilities within the admin panel.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation: High risk reduction within the Voyager admin panel. Significantly limits the impact of compromised Voyager accounts.
    *   Insider Threats: Medium risk reduction within Voyager. Makes it harder for insiders to perform unauthorized actions within the admin panel.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic Voyager role assignment is used, but default Voyager roles are largely unchanged and might be overly permissive. Implemented in Voyager's user and role management modules.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed review and customization of default Voyager roles and permissions. Creation of more granular, task-specific Voyager roles. Regular audits of Voyager role assignments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Inputs in Voyager Forms](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_inputs_in_voyager_forms.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all Voyager BREAD forms and custom forms *within Voyager* that handle user input.
    *   Step 2: For each form field in Voyager, implement server-side input validation using Laravel's validation rules. Define rules for data type, format, length, and allowed values specifically for Voyager forms.
    *   Step 3: Sanitize user inputs in Voyager forms to prevent XSS attacks. Use Laravel's `e()` helper function to escape output when displaying user-provided data from Voyager forms in Blade templates.
    *   Step 4: For rich text editors used in Voyager (like TinyMCE), configure them to use a secure configuration that limits potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes within the Voyager context.
    *   Step 5: Implement client-side validation in Voyager forms as an additional layer of defense and to improve user experience, but always rely on server-side validation for security within Voyager.
    *   Step 6: Regularly review and update validation and sanitization rules for Voyager forms as new input fields are added or application requirements change within the admin panel.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity): Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into Voyager admin pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, and defacement within the admin panel.
    *   SQL Injection (Medium Severity - if input is used in raw SQL queries, which should be avoided in Laravel):  While Laravel's Eloquent ORM largely prevents SQL injection, proper input validation in Voyager forms is still good practice.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High risk reduction within the Voyager admin panel. Effectively prevents most common XSS attack vectors in Voyager forms.
    *   SQL Injection: Low to Medium risk reduction (in Laravel/Voyager context). Provides an additional layer of defense for Voyager forms.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Laravel's basic validation rules are used in some Voyager forms, but comprehensive sanitization and XSS prevention might be missing in all areas of Voyager forms, especially in custom BREAD implementations. Implemented in some Voyager form requests and controllers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic review and implementation of input sanitization across all Voyager forms. Secure configuration of rich text editors within Voyager. Implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) for Voyager admin panel.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Uploads (within Voyager Media Manager and BREAD)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_uploads__within_voyager_media_manager_and_bread_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Configure Voyager's file upload settings to store uploaded files from the Voyager media manager and BREAD fields outside of the web-accessible public directory. Use Laravel's storage system to manage file paths for Voyager uploads.
    *   Step 2: Implement strict file type validation on the server-side for Voyager file uploads. Only allow explicitly permitted file types (e.g., images, documents) and reject all others uploaded through Voyager.
    *   Step 3: Limit file upload sizes in Voyager to reasonable values to prevent denial-of-service attacks and storage exhaustion via Voyager's upload features.
    *   Step 4: Rename files uploaded through Voyager to prevent directory traversal attacks and to make filenames less predictable. Consider using UUIDs or hashes for filenames in Voyager uploads.
    *   Step 5: Implement virus scanning for files uploaded through Voyager using an antivirus library or service.
    *   Step 6: When serving uploaded files from Voyager, use secure methods that prevent direct access to the storage directory. Utilize Laravel's `Storage::url()` or create a controller action to serve Voyager files with proper authorization checks.
    *   Step 7: Regularly review and update file upload security measures for Voyager, especially if new file types are allowed or storage configurations change within Voyager.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious File Upload (High Severity): Prevents attackers from uploading and executing malicious files (e.g., shell scripts, web shells) on the server through Voyager's upload functionalities.
    *   Directory Traversal (Medium Severity): Prevents attackers from accessing files outside of the intended Voyager upload directory by manipulating file paths in Voyager uploads.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Limits the impact of DoS attacks through excessive file uploads via Voyager by setting file size limits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious File Upload: High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of server compromise through Voyager file uploads.
    *   Directory Traversal: Medium risk reduction. Prevents a common file access vulnerability related to Voyager uploads.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium risk reduction. Mitigates one potential DoS vector related to Voyager uploads.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Voyager file uploads are stored outside the public directory, and basic file type validation might be in place for some BREAD types. Implemented in Voyager's media manager and BREAD file upload fields.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive file type validation and MIME type checking for Voyager uploads. File renaming and secure filename generation for Voyager uploads. Virus scanning for Voyager uploads. Secure file serving mechanism with authorization checks for Voyager files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change Voyager's Route Prefix](./mitigation_strategies/change_voyager's_route_prefix.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Open the Voyager configuration file (`config/voyager.php`).
    *   Step 2: Locate the `route.prefix` configuration option within the Voyager configuration. It is usually set to `admin` by default.
    *   Step 3: Change the `route.prefix` value to a less predictable and harder-to-guess string. Avoid common words or easily guessable patterns for the Voyager admin route.
    *   Step 4: Clear the application cache and configuration cache after changing the route prefix to ensure the changes are applied to Voyager.
    *   Step 5: Update any bookmarks or links that point to the old `/admin` route to use the new Voyager route prefix.
    *   Step 6: Inform administrators about the new Voyager admin panel URL.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Security by Obscurity - Information Disclosure (Low Severity): Makes it slightly harder for automated scanners and casual attackers to locate the Voyager admin panel specifically.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Security by Obscurity - Information Disclosure: Low risk reduction. Primarily a deterrent against automated attacks and casual probing of the Voyager admin panel.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. The default `/admin` route prefix for Voyager is still in use.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Changing the `route.prefix` in `config/voyager.php` for Voyager. Updating documentation and administrator communication about the new Voyager admin panel URL.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for Voyager Admin Panel](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__for_voyager_admin_panel.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a Content Security Policy that restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources specifically for the Voyager admin panel routes.
    *   Step 2: Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or Laravel middleware to send the CSP header with every response *specifically for the Voyager admin panel routes*.
    *   Step 3: Start with a restrictive CSP policy for Voyager and gradually refine it as needed. Begin with directives like `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'`, `style-src 'self'`, `img-src 'self'` for the Voyager admin panel.
    *   Step 4: If you need to load resources from external CDNs or domains within the Voyager admin panel, explicitly allow them in the CSP using directives like `script-src 'self' cdn.example.com`, `style-src 'self' fonts.googleapis.com` for Voyager.
    *   Step 5: Use CSP reporting to monitor violations and identify areas where the policy needs adjustment for the Voyager admin panel. Configure `report-uri` or `report-to` directives to receive reports of CSP violations specifically within Voyager.
    *   Step 6: Regularly review and update the CSP policy for the Voyager admin panel as your application evolves and new external resources are used within Voyager.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity): CSP significantly reduces the impact of XSS attacks within the Voyager admin panel by preventing the browser from executing unauthorized scripts.
    *   Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity): Can help mitigate certain types of data injection attacks within the Voyager admin panel by limiting data sources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium to High risk reduction within the Voyager admin panel. Provides a strong defense-in-depth layer against XSS in Voyager.
    *   Data Injection Attacks: Medium risk reduction within Voyager. Offers some protection against certain data injection vectors in Voyager.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. CSP headers are not currently configured for the Voyager admin panel.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Defining and implementing a CSP policy specifically for the Voyager admin panel. Configuring web server or Laravel middleware to send CSP headers for Voyager routes. Setting up CSP reporting for Voyager.
