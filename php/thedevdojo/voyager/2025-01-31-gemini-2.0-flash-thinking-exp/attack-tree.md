## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via Voyager](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_voyager.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** This is the root goal and can be achieved through any of the child nodes in the tree.  It represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has control over the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access to Voyager Admin Panel](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_unauthorized_access_to_voyager_admin_panel.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses:** This is the primary way to gain unauthorized admin access.
        *   **Weak Default Credentials:** If default credentials for the Voyager admin panel are not changed, attackers can easily guess or find them online and log in.
        *   **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing Attacks:** Attackers can attempt to guess passwords through brute-force attacks or use lists of compromised credentials (credential stuffing) to try and log in.
        *   **Session Hijacking/Fixation:** If session management is insecure, attackers might be able to hijack a legitimate admin session or fixate a session to gain access.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Voyager's Authentication Logic:**  Zero-day or known vulnerabilities in Voyager's authentication code could allow attackers to bypass login mechanisms.
        *   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** Flaws in authorization logic might allow attackers with lower privileges to access admin functionalities.
    *   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Voyager's Middleware/Guards:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom or Voyager's built-in middleware that handles authentication and authorization.
        *   **Exploiting Misconfigurations:** Misconfigurations in Voyager or the web server might inadvertently bypass authentication checks.
        *   **Privilege Escalation within Voyager:** Gaining access with a lower-level account and then exploiting vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to admin level.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Weak Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_weak_default_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Default Credentials Not Changed:**  The most direct attack vector. Attackers simply try the default username and password combinations provided in Voyager's documentation or commonly used defaults.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Extremely easy to exploit, requires minimal skill, and has a critical impact (full admin access).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Voyager Features to Achieve Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_voyager_features_to_achieve_code_execution.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers aim to use Voyager's features in unintended ways to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Media Manager Vulnerabilities:** The Media Manager, designed for file uploads and management, is a prime target.
        *   **Unrestricted File Upload:**  If file upload validation is insufficient, attackers can upload malicious files like web shells (e.g., PHP scripts) that allow them to execute commands on the server.
        *   **Bypass File Type Validation:** Attackers can use various techniques to bypass weak file type validation (e.g., changing extensions, using double extensions, null byte injection).
        *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Handling:** Exploiting flaws in how Voyager handles file paths to upload files to arbitrary locations or access sensitive files.
        *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Media Manager:** If the Media Manager has features that process external URLs (e.g., for image manipulation), SSRF vulnerabilities could be exploited to access internal resources or perform actions on behalf of the server.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Media Manager:** Injecting malicious scripts through filenames or metadata in uploaded files, which can then be executed when an admin views the Media Manager.
    *   **BREAD (CRUD) Functionality Exploits:**  If BREAD functionality is not securely implemented or customized.
        *   **Insecure Deserialization:** If Voyager uses deserialization for BREAD operations and doesn't properly sanitize input, attackers could inject malicious serialized objects to achieve code execution.
        *   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** If Voyager uses templating in BREAD and allows admin customization with user input that is not sanitized, SSTI vulnerabilities could allow code execution.
        *   **Code Injection via Custom BREAD Logic:**  Developers adding custom code to BREAD operations without proper security measures might introduce code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **SQL Injection:** While less likely in Voyager core, SQL injection could occur in custom BREAD queries if parameterized queries are not used or if Voyager's query builder has vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Media Manager Vulnerabilities -> Unrestricted File Upload -> Upload Malicious File](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_media_manager_vulnerabilities_-_unrestricted_file_upload_-_upload_mal_66bbdda9.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Lack of proper file type validation on the server-side allows uploading any file type.
    *   **Upload Malicious File (Web Shell):** Attackers upload a web shell (e.g., a PHP file containing code to execute commands) through the Media Manager.
    *   **Access Web Shell:** Attackers then access the uploaded web shell file directly via the web browser, executing the malicious code and gaining command execution on the server.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Unrestricted file upload is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability. Web shells are readily available, and the impact is critical (Remote Code Execution).
