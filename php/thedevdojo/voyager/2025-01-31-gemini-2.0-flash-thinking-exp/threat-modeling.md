# Threat Model Analysis for thedevdojo/voyager

## Threat: [Default Credentials Exploitation](./threats/default_credentials_exploitation.md)

- **Description:** Attackers attempt to log in to the Voyager admin panel using default usernames and passwords that were not changed during installation. They might use common default credentials or brute-force known default combinations.
- **Impact:** Full administrative access to the Voyager panel, allowing attackers to control the application, access and modify data, and potentially compromise the underlying server.
- **Voyager Component Affected:** Authentication Module, User Management
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Force password change upon first login for default admin user.
    - Remove or disable default admin user after initial setup.
    - Implement strong password policies and enforce them during user creation and password changes.

## Threat: [Insufficient RBAC Bypass](./threats/insufficient_rbac_bypass.md)

- **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Voyager's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to gain unauthorized access to features or data beyond their intended permissions. This could involve manipulating requests, exploiting logic flaws, or bypassing permission checks within Voyager's permission handling.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, functionalities, or administrative actions within Voyager. Potential for data breaches, data manipulation, and privilege escalation within the admin panel context.
- **Voyager Component Affected:** RBAC Module, Permissions System, Menu Builder, CRUD Operations
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Thoroughly define and test RBAC roles and permissions within Voyager.
    - Implement granular permissions based on the principle of least privilege within Voyager's permission settings.
    - Regularly audit and review user roles and permissions assignments in Voyager.
    - Conduct penetration testing specifically targeting Voyager's RBAC implementation.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking/Fixation](./threats/session_hijackingfixation.md)

- **Description:** Attackers intercept or manipulate user session identifiers (e.g., session cookies) used by Voyager to impersonate legitimate administrators. This can be achieved through network sniffing, cross-site scripting (XSS) if present in the application outside Voyager but affecting Voyager sessions, or session fixation attacks targeting Voyager's login process.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized administrative access to Voyager, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and system compromise through the admin panel.
- **Voyager Component Affected:** Authentication Module, Session Management (as implemented by Voyager/Laravel)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use HTTPS to encrypt session traffic and prevent session cookie interception.
    - Configure secure session settings (e.g., `secure`, `httponly` flags for cookies) in Laravel's session configuration, which Voyager utilizes.
    - Implement session timeout mechanisms for Voyager admin sessions.
    - Regenerate session IDs after successful login to Voyager.
    - Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for Voyager admin logins.

## Threat: [Unintended Data Exposure via Voyager Browser](./threats/unintended_data_exposure_via_voyager_browser.md)

- **Description:** Attackers gain access to the Voyager admin panel (through compromised credentials or vulnerabilities) and use the built-in database browsing interface to directly view sensitive data from the database tables exposed through Voyager's BREAD functionality.
- **Impact:** Confidential data leakage, privacy violations, and potential misuse of exposed information accessible through Voyager's data browsing features.
- **Voyager Component Affected:** Database Browser, BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) interface
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Restrict access to the Voyager admin panel to trusted networks or IP ranges.
    - Implement strong authentication and authorization for Voyager access.
    - Carefully consider which database tables are accessible through Voyager's BREAD interface and restrict access to sensitive tables if possible by customizing BREAD settings.
    - Monitor and log access to the Voyager admin panel and database browsing activities.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Exploitation](./threats/mass_assignment_exploitation.md)

- **Description:** Attackers manipulate request parameters during data creation or updates through Voyager's CRUD interface to modify fields that are not intended to be user-editable via the admin panel. This exploits mass assignment vulnerabilities if Laravel models used by Voyager are not properly protected.
- **Impact:** Data integrity compromise within Voyager-managed data, unauthorized modification of sensitive fields exposed through the admin panel, potential privilege escalation if user roles or permissions are modified via mass assignment.
- **Voyager Component Affected:** CRUD Operations, Data Input Handling within Voyager, Model Interactions (in the context of Voyager's CRUD)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Define `$fillable` or `$guarded` attributes in Laravel models used with Voyager's BREAD to control mass assignment.
    - Validate user inputs thoroughly in Laravel models and controllers, especially for data handled through Voyager's CRUD.
    - Review Voyager's BREAD configuration and ensure mass assignment protection is considered for all models used with Voyager.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload via Media Manager](./threats/malicious_file_upload_via_media_manager.md)

- **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware, viruses) through Voyager's media manager. If executed, these files can compromise the server, leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, originating from the Voyager media management feature.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise initiated through Voyager's media manager, data breaches, malware infection, denial of service.
- **Voyager Component Affected:** Media Manager, File Upload Functionality
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict file type validation and sanitization on the server-side for Voyager's media manager uploads.
    - Store uploaded files outside of the web root to prevent direct execution from the web server.
    - Configure web server to prevent script execution in the media storage directory used by Voyager (e.g., using `.htaccess` or web server configurations).
    - Implement file size limits for uploads in Voyager's media manager.
    - Regularly scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Voyager's customizable templates or views, if such customization features are enabled and improperly handled. If the template engine improperly renders this code, it can lead to server-side template injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server through Voyager's customization capabilities.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution originating from Voyager's template customization features, server compromise, data breaches, complete system takeover.
- **Voyager Component Affected:** View Customization (if enabled), Template Engine (in the context of Voyager's customization), potentially Hooks or Events if they involve template rendering.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Carefully sanitize and validate any user-provided input used in Voyager's template customization features.
    - Limit or disable template customization features in Voyager if not strictly necessary to reduce attack surface.
    - Use secure templating practices and output encoding to prevent code injection in Voyager's custom templates.
    - Regularly audit and review any custom templates implemented within Voyager for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Custom Features](./threats/sql_injection_in_custom_features.md)

- **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom queries or features added to Voyager (or extensions) that are not properly parameterized. This allows them to inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed by Voyager's custom functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or database compromise.
- **Impact:** Data breaches affecting data managed through Voyager or accessible via Voyager, data manipulation within the Voyager-managed database, database compromise potentially originating from Voyager's custom code paths.
- **Voyager Component Affected:** Custom Code, Extensions, potentially BREAD customization if using raw queries, any custom database interactions within Voyager.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use Laravel's query builder and Eloquent ORM to prevent SQL injection when developing custom features or extensions for Voyager.
    - Parameterize all database queries and avoid direct string concatenation of user inputs into SQL queries in Voyager custom code.
    - Conduct thorough security testing, including SQL injection testing, for any custom Voyager features or extensions that interact with the database.
    - Use database access control to limit the permissions of the database user used by the application, minimizing the impact of potential SQL injection.
