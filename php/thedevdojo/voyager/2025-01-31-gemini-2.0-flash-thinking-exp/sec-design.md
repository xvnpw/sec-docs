    style Artifacts fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: Developers write code for Voyager or applications using Voyager and commit changes to a Version Control System.
2.  Version Control System (VCS):  A platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket is used to manage the source code and track changes.
3.  CI/CD System: A Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery system, such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI, is triggered by code changes in the VCS.
4.  Build Process: The CI/CD system executes the build process. For a PHP Laravel project like Voyager, this typically involves:
    -   Dependency Management: Using Composer to install PHP dependencies.
    -   Asset Compilation: Using npm or yarn to manage and compile front-end assets (if applicable).
    -   Configuration: Setting up build configurations.
5.  Security Checks & Tests:  Automated security checks and tests are performed as part of the build process:
    -   SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Tools to scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
    -   Dependency Scanning: Tools to check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    -   Unit Tests: Running unit tests to ensure code functionality and catch regressions.
    -   Linters: Code linters to enforce code quality and coding standards, which can indirectly improve security.
6.  Build Artifacts: If security checks and tests pass, the build process produces deployable artifacts. This could be a packaged application, container image, or simply the application code ready for deployment.
7.  Deployment Environment: The build artifacts are then deployed to the target deployment environment (e.g., staging, production).

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control Automated Build Process: Using a CI/CD system automates the build process, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistency.
- security control Version Control: Using VCS provides traceability of code changes and enables rollback if necessary.
- security control Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline help identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code early in the development lifecycle.
- security control Dependency Scanning: Automated dependency scanning during the build process helps detect and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control Automated Testing: Unit tests and integration tests help ensure code quality and reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities through code changes.
- security control Secure Build Environment: Ensuring the CI/CD environment itself is secure, with proper access controls and security configurations.
- security control Artifact Signing/Verification: Signing build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering during deployment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Management of website content: Ensuring content is accurate, up-to-date, and appropriate.
- User management: Managing admin user accounts, roles, and permissions to control access to the admin panel.
- Application settings management: Configuring application settings and parameters that affect the functionality and security of the Laravel application.
- Data management: Managing application data stored in the database, ensuring data integrity and availability.

Data Sensitivity:
- User credentials (admin users): Highly sensitive. Compromise can lead to unauthorized access to the entire admin panel and potentially the underlying application and data.
- Application configuration data: Sensitive. May contain database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive settings.
- Website content: Sensitivity depends on the nature of the content. Public content might be less sensitive, while confidential or proprietary content is highly sensitive.
- Application data: Sensitivity depends on the type of data stored by the Laravel application. Could range from low sensitivity (e.g., public blog posts) to highly sensitive (e.g., personal user data, financial information).
