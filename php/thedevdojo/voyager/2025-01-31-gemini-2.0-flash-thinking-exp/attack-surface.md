# Attack Surface Analysis for thedevdojo/voyager

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass in Admin Panel](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_in_admin_panel.md)

**Description:** Circumventing Voyager's built-in login process to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel. This exploits vulnerabilities specifically within Voyager's authentication mechanisms.

**Voyager Contribution:** Voyager implements its own authentication system for the admin panel. Weaknesses in this system are direct attack vectors.

**Example:** A flaw in Voyager's login controller allows bypassing password checks by manipulating request parameters, granting admin dashboard access without valid credentials.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application's administrative functions, including data manipulation, user management, and system configuration changes via Voyager's interface.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Voyager Updated:** Regularly update Voyager to the latest version to patch known authentication vulnerabilities within the package.
*   **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication:** If possible, implement multi-factor authentication for Voyager admin logins, either through Voyager's configuration or custom integrations.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security audits specifically focusing on Voyager's authentication logic and implementation.
*   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Implement and enforce strong password policies for all Voyager admin users.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the Voyager admin panel that executes in the browsers of administrators. This targets vulnerabilities within Voyager's admin interface components.

**Voyager Contribution:** Voyager's admin panel is built using dynamic views and JavaScript. Vulnerabilities in Voyager's views, JavaScript code, or server-side rendering can lead to XSS.

**Example:** An administrator edits a data record using Voyager's BREAD interface, and a malicious script is injected into a text field. When another administrator views this record within Voyager, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions within the admin context.

**Impact:** Session hijacking of administrators accessing Voyager, defacement of the Voyager admin panel, data theft from within the admin interface, and potential further compromise of the application through admin actions.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Robust Output Encoding:** Implement strict output encoding for all user-supplied data displayed within Voyager's admin panel views to prevent script injection.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Utilize a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the Voyager admin panel can load resources and execute scripts, reducing the impact of XSS.
*   **Regular Code Audits:** Regularly audit Voyager's view templates and JavaScript code for potential XSS vulnerabilities introduced by Voyager or customizations.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in BREAD Functionality](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_bread_functionality.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Voyager's BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) operations to inject malicious SQL queries into the database. This targets weaknesses in how Voyager constructs database queries.

**Voyager Contribution:** Voyager's BREAD system dynamically generates database queries based on user input and configurations defined within Voyager. Improper sanitization in Voyager's BREAD implementation can lead to SQL injection.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates a search filter in Voyager's BREAD interface, injecting SQL code through Voyager's search query handling. This code is executed by the database, allowing data extraction, modification, or bypass of security measures defined in the application.

**Impact:** Data breach through Voyager's data access points, data manipulation or deletion via Voyager's interface, potential for complete database compromise and in severe cases, remote code execution on the database server.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Leverage Eloquent ORM Securely:** Ensure correct and secure usage of Laravel's Eloquent ORM and query builder within Voyager customizations and configurations, as these provide built-in protection when used as intended.
*   **Avoid Raw SQL in Voyager:** Minimize or eliminate the use of raw SQL queries within Voyager customizations or extensions, relying on secure ORM methods.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (BREAD):** Implement thorough input validation and sanitization specifically for all user inputs used in Voyager's BREAD operations, especially search filters, data manipulation forms, and relationship handling.
*   **Database Security Audits:** Regularly perform database security audits and penetration testing focusing specifically on Voyager's BREAD functionalities and data interaction points.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload in Media Manager](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload_in_media_manager.md)

**Description:** Uploading malicious files, such as web shells or executables, through Voyager's media manager due to insufficient file type and content validation within Voyager's media management features.

**Voyager Contribution:** Voyager provides a built-in media manager for file uploads. Vulnerabilities in Voyager's file upload handling and validation directly expose this attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image file through Voyager's media manager. By directly accessing this uploaded file via the web server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining control through Voyager's media upload feature.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server originating from Voyager's media manager, full server compromise, data breach, website defacement initiated through malicious uploads via Voyager.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict File Type Validation (Voyager Media Manager):** Implement strict file type validation within Voyager's media manager configuration, allowing only necessary and safe file types to be uploaded.
*   **File Content Validation:** Validate file content beyond extension checks to prevent bypassing file type restrictions (e.g., using file signature verification within Voyager's upload process).
*   **Web Server Configuration for Uploads:** Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts within the media upload directory used by Voyager (e.g., using `.htaccess` or web server configurations specific to the media directory).
*   **File Size Limits:** Implement file size limits in Voyager's media manager to mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks through excessively large file uploads.
*   **Consider Dedicated Storage:** Consider using a dedicated and secured storage service (like cloud storage) for media files managed by Voyager, with appropriate security configurations and separation from the application server's execution context.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in BREAD Operations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_bread_operations.md)

**Description:** Accessing or manipulating data records without proper authorization by directly manipulating object identifiers (IDs) in URLs or requests within Voyager's BREAD interface. This exploits authorization flaws in Voyager's BREAD access control.

**Voyager Contribution:** Voyager's BREAD system relies on IDs to access and manipulate data. Insufficient authorization checks within Voyager's BREAD controllers can lead to IDOR vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A user authorized to manage only their own data records in Voyager's admin panel can, by manipulating the record ID in the URL within Voyager's BREAD interface, access and potentially modify records belonging to other users, bypassing Voyager's intended access controls.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed through Voyager, data manipulation or deletion of records beyond authorized scope, potential privilege escalation if IDOR allows access to administrative data.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Robust Authorization Checks (Voyager BREAD):** Implement strong authorization checks within Voyager's BREAD controllers and policies. Ensure that users can only access and manipulate data they are explicitly authorized to, based on Voyager's roles and permissions.
*   **Avoid Direct ID Exposure:** Where feasible, avoid directly exposing database IDs in URLs within Voyager's admin interface. Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential, less predictable identifiers for data records in URLs.
*   **Permission Verification in BREAD Actions:** Always rigorously verify user permissions within Voyager's BREAD action handlers before performing any data operations, especially when handling object IDs passed through requests.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Voyager Package Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_voyager_package_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in third-party PHP packages or JavaScript libraries that Voyager directly depends on. These vulnerabilities are indirectly introduced into the application through the Voyager package.

**Voyager Contribution:** Voyager relies on a set of external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies become part of Voyager's attack surface and thus the application's attack surface when Voyager is used.

**Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a JavaScript library bundled with or used by Voyager's admin panel. If Voyager is not updated to a version that uses a patched dependency, applications using that version of Voyager remain vulnerable to exploits targeting this dependency.

**Impact:**  Impact varies widely depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability. Potential impacts include XSS, SQL injection, remote code execution, denial of service, or other vulnerabilities originating from Voyager's dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regular Voyager Updates (Dependencies Included):**  Prioritize regularly updating Voyager to the latest version. Voyager updates often include updates to its dependencies, addressing known vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning Tools:** Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., `composer audit` for PHP dependencies, `npm audit` or `yarn audit` for JavaScript dependencies if applicable to Voyager's frontend assets) into the development and deployment pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities in Voyager's dependencies.
*   **Security Monitoring and Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Voyager and its dependencies. Subscribe to security mailing lists or use vulnerability monitoring services to stay informed about newly discovered risks.
*   **Selective Dependency Updates (If Necessary):** In cases where a specific dependency vulnerability is identified, and a full Voyager update is not immediately feasible, explore options for selectively updating the vulnerable dependency if possible and compatible with Voyager.
