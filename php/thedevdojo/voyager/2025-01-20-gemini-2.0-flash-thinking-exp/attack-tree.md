## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Voyager Admin Panel [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_voyager_admin_panel__critical_.md)

* **Goal:** Gain Unauthorized Access to Voyager Admin Panel [CRITICAL]
* **Attack Vector:** Exploit Weak Authentication Mechanisms
    * **Sub-Vector:** Brute-force Login Credentials
        * **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess user credentials by systematically trying a large number of possible usernames and passwords.
        * **Conditions for Success:**
            * Weak or easily guessable passwords.
            * Lack of account lockout or rate limiting mechanisms on the login page.
        * **Impact:** Successful brute-force leads to complete unauthorized access to the Voyager admin panel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server__critical_.md)

* **Goal:** Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL]
* **Attack Vector:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Code Editor Feature [CRITICAL]
    * **Sub-Vector:** Inject Malicious Code via the Editor
        * **Description:** An attacker, having gained access to the Voyager admin panel (or potentially through other vulnerabilities), uses the built-in code editor to inject malicious code (e.g., PHP code) directly into application files.
        * **Conditions for Success:**
            * The code editor feature is enabled and accessible.
            * Lack of sufficient input validation and sanitization within the code editor.
            * Inadequate permissions controls on the files the editor can modify.
        * **Impact:** Successful injection of malicious code allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server__critical_.md)

* **Goal:** Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [CRITICAL]
* **Attack Vector:** Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]
    * **Sub-Vector:** Upload Malicious PHP Files
        * **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the file upload functionality of Voyager to upload a malicious PHP file to the server. This file can then be accessed directly via a web request, executing the malicious code.
        * **Conditions for Success:**
            * Lack of proper file type validation (e.g., relying solely on client-side checks or easily bypassed checks).
            * Inadequate checks for file content.
            * Uploaded files being stored in a publicly accessible directory and executable by the web server.
        * **Impact:** Successful upload and execution of a malicious PHP file allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
