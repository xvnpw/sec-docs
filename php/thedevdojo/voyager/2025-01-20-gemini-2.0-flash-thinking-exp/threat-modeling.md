# Threat Model Analysis for thedevdojo/voyager

## Threat: [Default Credentials Exploitation](./threats/default_credentials_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses default, unchanged credentials (if they exist) to log into the Voyager admin panel. This allows them to bypass authentication entirely.

**Impact:** Full administrative access to the application, allowing the attacker to modify data, configurations, create new administrative users, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Affected Component:** Voyager Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Immediately change default credentials upon installation.
- Enforce mandatory password changes during the initial setup process.
- Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/insecure_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP web shell) through Voyager's media manager or other file upload functionalities due to insufficient validation and sanitization within Voyager's code. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to control the application, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems.

**Affected Component:** Voyager Media Manager Module, potentially other file upload functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the extension within Voyager's upload handling.
- Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities within Voyager's file handling.
- Store uploaded files outside the webroot and ensure Voyager serves them through a separate, secure mechanism.
- Limit the types of files that can be uploaded through Voyager's configuration.
- Scan uploaded files for malware.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious requests to modify unintended database fields through Voyager's data input forms if Voyager's BREAD implementation doesn't properly protect against mass assignment.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation (e.g., changing a user's role to administrator), or other unintended modifications to the application's data.

**Affected Component:** Voyager BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) functionality, Model handling within Voyager.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Utilize Laravel's `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on Eloquent models, ensuring Voyager respects these definitions.
- Carefully review and restrict the fields exposed in Voyager's BREAD interface configuration.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Voyager UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_voyager_ui.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into fields within the Voyager admin panel (e.g., through BREAD editing or settings provided by Voyager). This script is then executed in the browsers of other administrators who view the affected data.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions performed within the context of an administrator's session.

**Affected Component:** Voyager User Interface (Blade templates, JavaScript code), BREAD functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Sanitize all user-supplied input rendered in Voyager's UI using appropriate escaping techniques within Voyager's Blade templates and JavaScript.
- Utilize Laravel's Blade templating engine's built-in escaping mechanisms within Voyager's views.
- Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Voyager's Custom Query Features (if any)](./threats/sql_injection_via_voyager's_custom_query_features__if_any_.md)

**Description:** If Voyager provides features allowing administrators to execute custom SQL queries, insufficient input sanitization within Voyager's code could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, or even the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Affected Component:** Potentially Voyager's database management features or custom query functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid providing direct SQL query execution capabilities within Voyager if possible.
- If necessary, ensure Voyager uses parameterized queries or prepared statements exclusively.
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided input used in SQL queries within Voyager's code.
