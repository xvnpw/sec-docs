# Threat Model Analysis for thedevdojo/voyager

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation via Credential Compromise](./threats/unauthorized_access_and_privilege_escalation_via_credential_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a Voyager administrator account through phishing, credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, or by exploiting weak passwords. Once logged in, the attacker may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to further elevate their privileges within Voyager.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the application's data and configuration. The attacker could modify, delete, or steal data, deface the website, install malware, or disrupt the application's functionality.
    *   **Voyager Component Affected:** Voyager Authentication System, Roles & Permissions System, potentially all BREAD interfaces.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, regular changes).
        *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for *all* Voyager administrator accounts. This is the single most important mitigation.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   Regularly educate administrators about phishing and social engineering attacks.
        *   Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity (e.g., logins from unusual locations or at unusual times).

## Threat: [Data Tampering via BREAD Interface Abuse](./threats/data_tampering_via_bread_interface_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with legitimate (but potentially limited) access to the Voyager admin panel uses the BREAD interfaces to modify data in the database in unauthorized ways. This could involve changing product prices, user roles, content, or any other data managed by Voyager.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, financial loss, reputational damage, disruption of application functionality, unauthorized access to other systems (if database credentials are changed).
    *   **Voyager Component Affected:** BREAD interfaces for all managed database tables.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege *meticulously*. Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions within Voyager's roles and permissions system. Don't give blanket "admin" access.
        *   Regularly review and audit the roles and permissions assigned to users.
        *   Consider implementing custom validation rules within Voyager (using model events or custom controllers) to further restrict data modifications.
        *   Implement robust database backups and a recovery plan.

## Threat: [Unauthorized File Access via Media Manager Misconfiguration](./threats/unauthorized_file_access_via_media_manager_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration in Voyager's Media Manager to gain unauthorized access to uploaded files. This could include sensitive documents, images, or other files stored on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, potential for malware distribution (if attackers can upload malicious files).
    *   **Voyager Component Affected:** Media Manager.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the Media Manager's storage settings (e.g., storage disk, visibility) to ensure that files are stored securely and are not directly accessible via predictable URLs.
        *   Use appropriate file system permissions to restrict access to uploaded files.
        *   Implement file type validation to prevent the upload of potentially malicious files (e.g., executable files).
        *   Regularly review and audit the Media Manager's configuration and uploaded files.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Voyager Vulnerability or Custom Code](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_voyager_vulnerability_or_custom_code.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Voyager itself (e.g., a bug in its permission checking logic) or in custom code that interacts with Voyager (e.g., a custom hook or event listener) to gain elevated privileges within the admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could gain full control over the application, similar to a compromised administrator account.
    *   **Voyager Component Affected:** Voyager Core, Roles & Permissions System, custom hooks/event listeners, Voyager API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Voyager updated to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly review security advisories related to Voyager and Laravel.
        *   Thoroughly test any custom code that interacts with Voyager's API or extends its functionality. Follow secure coding practices.
        *   Implement a code review process for all custom code.
        *   Use a static code analysis tool to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [BREAD Configuration Tampering](./threats/bread_configuration_tampering.md)

* **Description:** An attacker with access to modify BREAD settings alters the configuration to expose sensitive data, disable security features, or otherwise manipulate the behavior of the admin panel.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, weakened security controls, potential for further attacks.
    * **Voyager Component Affected:** BREAD configuration interface.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to modify BREAD settings to a very limited number of highly trusted administrators.
        *   Regularly review and audit BREAD configurations for any unauthorized changes.
        *   Implement a change management process for BREAD configurations, requiring approval before changes are made.
        *   Consider storing BREAD configurations in version control to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.
