# Attack Surface Analysis for thedevdojo/voyager

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Roles and Permissions](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_roles_and_permissions.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly defined or overly permissive roles and permissions within Voyager's RBAC system, allowing users to access functionality or data they shouldn't.
*   **Voyager Contribution:** Voyager's core functionality *is* RBAC.  Its ease of use can lead to over-provisioning if not carefully managed.  The entire security model hinges on this configuration.
*   **Example:** A user with the "editor" role is accidentally granted the "browse_admin" permission, allowing them to access the Voyager settings and potentially other sensitive areas.  Or, a custom role is created with overly broad permissions like `edit_users` when it should only have `read_users`.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users *only* the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically review all roles, permissions, and user assignments.
    *   **Fine-Grained Permissions:**  Avoid broad permissions (e.g., "browse_admin").  Use specific permissions (e.g., "browse_posts," "edit_posts," "add_posts").
    *   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test all roles and permissions to ensure they function as intended.  Use different user accounts to verify access restrictions.
    *   **Documentation:**  Clearly document the purpose and scope of each role and permission.

## Attack Surface: [BREAD Misconfiguration (Overly Permissive CRUD)](./attack_surfaces/bread_misconfiguration__overly_permissive_crud_.md)

*   **Description:**  Voyager's BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) interfaces are configured to expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized actions on database tables.
*   **Voyager Contribution:** BREAD is Voyager's primary mechanism for interacting with the database.  Its rapid development capabilities can lead to insecure configurations if not carefully reviewed.
*   **Example:**  A BREAD interface for the "users" table exposes the "password" column (even if hashed), or allows any logged-in user to delete other users.  Another example is exposing internal IDs or timestamps that could be used in other attacks.
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches (viewing sensitive data), data corruption (modifying data), denial of service (deleting data), information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Column Selection:**  Carefully select *only* the necessary columns to be displayed and editable in each BREAD interface.  Hide sensitive columns.
    *   **Validation Rules:**  Use Voyager's built-in validation rules to enforce data integrity and prevent invalid input.
    *   **Database Views:**  Consider using database views to restrict access to sensitive data at the database level, presenting a limited view to Voyager.
    *   **Relationship Management:**  Carefully configure how related data is displayed and managed to prevent information leakage.
    *   **Read-Only Fields:** Mark fields that should not be edited as read-only.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads (Media Manager)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads__media_manager_.md)

*   **Description:**  Voyager's media manager allows uploading files without proper restrictions on file types, sizes, or storage locations, leading to potential remote code execution.
*   **Voyager Contribution:** Voyager provides a built-in media manager, making file uploads a core feature.  The default configuration may not be secure for all use cases.
*   **Example:**  An attacker uploads a PHP file disguised as a JPG image, which is then executed by the web server, granting the attacker control.  Or, an attacker uploads a massive file, filling up server storage and causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution (RCE), complete system compromise, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation:**  Implement *server-side* validation of file types, using MIME types and file signatures (magic numbers), not just file extensions.  Do *not* rely solely on client-side validation.
    *   **File Size Limits:**  Enforce strict file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Storage Location:**  Store uploaded files *outside* the web root, if possible, to prevent direct execution.  If storing within the web root, use a dedicated directory with restricted access.
    *   **File Renaming:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent attackers from predicting file names and accessing them directly.
    *   **Malware Scanning:**  Integrate a malware scanner to scan uploaded files for malicious content.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict where scripts can be loaded from, mitigating the risk of executing uploaded malicious scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Voyager Authentication](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_voyager_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**  Administrative routes or functionalities are accessible without going through Voyager's authentication and authorization checks.
*   **Voyager Contribution:**  Voyager is designed to be the gatekeeper for administrative access.  If it's bypassed, its security mechanisms are ineffective.
*   **Example:**  A developer creates a custom route (`/admin/secret-function`) that performs administrative actions but forgets to apply Voyager's middleware or equivalent authentication checks.  An attacker discovers this route and gains unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to administrative functions, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Route Protection:**  Ensure *all* administrative routes are protected by Voyager's middleware (`VoyagerAuthMiddleware`) or a custom middleware that enforces Voyager's permissions.
    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review code to identify any routes or functions that bypass Voyager's security checks.
    *   **Centralized Authentication:**  Avoid implementing separate authentication mechanisms for administrative functions.  Rely on Voyager's authentication or integrate it with a single, secure authentication system.
    * **Route Listing:** Regularly review the application's route list (`php artisan route:list`) to identify any unprotected administrative routes.

## Attack Surface: [Voyager Hooks and Events Abuse](./attack_surfaces/voyager_hooks_and_events_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Custom code added to Voyager's hooks or event handlers is vulnerable to injection or executes untrusted input, leading to code execution.
*   **Voyager Contribution:** Voyager's extensibility through hooks and events creates potential entry points for attackers if not handled securely.
*   **Example:** A developer adds a hook to log user actions, but the logging function is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't properly sanitize user input. Or, a hook executes a shell command based on user-provided data without validation.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, SQL injection, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Carefully sanitize *all* input used within Voyager hooks and event handlers.  Treat all input as potentially malicious.
    *   **Avoid Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Do *not* execute arbitrary code based on user input.  Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to interact with the database.
    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all code added to Voyager hooks and event handlers for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the code executed within hooks and events has only the minimum necessary permissions.
