## Attack Tree Path: [1. Bypass Authentication [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__bypass_authentication__high_risk_.md)

**1. Bypass Authentication [HIGH RISK]**

*   **1.1.1 Weak Default Configuration [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker leverages default or easily guessable credentials (e.g., "admin/password") or unchanged default settings that grant administrative access. This often occurs when administrators fail to change default passwords or configurations after installation.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies during installation and for all user accounts.
        *   Mandate configuration changes upon first login, guiding users through a secure setup process.
        *   Provide clear and prominent security guidelines in the documentation, emphasizing the importance of changing default settings.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on administrator diligence)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts might be logged, but successful logins will appear legitimate)

*   **1.2 Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker uses automated tools to try a large number of username/password combinations, either guessing common passwords (brute-force) or using credentials leaked from other breaches (credential stuffing).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the Voyager login route to slow down automated attempts.
        *   Use a CAPTCHA to distinguish between human users and bots.
        *   Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   Monitor server logs for suspicious login activity, such as a high volume of failed attempts from a single IP address.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Common attack vector)
    *   **Impact:** High (Full administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Automated tools are readily available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts and rate limiting triggers can be detected)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Voyager's BREAD Functionality [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_voyager's_bread_functionality__high_risk_.md)

**2. Exploit Voyager's BREAD Functionality [HIGH RISK]**

*   **2.1 Improper Input Validation in BREAD Operations [HIGH RISK]**
    * This is a broad category, and the specific *critical* sub-node is detailed below.

    *   **2.1.3 File Upload Vulnerabilities (if Voyager handles file uploads) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **2.1.3.1 Uploading Malicious Files [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uploads a file containing malicious code (e.g., a PHP shell) disguised as a legitimate file type (e.g., an image). If the server executes this file, the attacker gains control of the application or server.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Implement strict file type validation, going beyond just checking the file extension. Use MIME type checking and, if possible, content inspection.
                *   Store uploaded files outside the web root, preventing direct access via a URL.
                *   Rename uploaded files to random, unpredictable names to prevent direct access even if the storage location is discovered.
                *   Scan uploaded files with an up-to-date anti-virus scanner.
                *   Consider using a dedicated file storage service (e.g., AWS S3) with proper security configurations, including restricting execution permissions.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common attack vector if file uploads are allowed)
            *   **Impact:** High (Remote code execution, full system compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High (Requires file analysis and monitoring for unusual processes)

*   **2.2.1 Incorrectly Configured BREAD Permissions [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits misconfigured permissions within Voyager's BREAD interface to access or modify data they should not have access to. This can occur if roles and permissions are not properly defined or if there are flaws in how Voyager enforces these permissions.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Carefully review and configure BREAD permissions for each table and user role.
        *   Thoroughly test access controls for different user roles, ensuring users can only access and modify data as intended.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly audit BREAD configurations and user permissions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on administrator diligence in configuration)
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High (Unauthorized data access and/or modification)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires analyzing user activity and comparing it to expected permissions)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Voyager's Media Manager (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_voyager's_media_manager__if_applicable_.md)

**3. Exploit Voyager's Media Manager (if applicable)**

*    **3.1 Similar vulnerabilities as 2.1.3 (File Upload Vulnerabilities), but specifically targeting the media manager interface. [CRITICAL]**
    * **Description:** Identical to 2.1.3, but the attack vector is specifically Voyager's media manager interface.  If the media manager allows file uploads, all the vulnerabilities and mitigations of 2.1.3 apply.
    * **Mitigations:** Same as 2.1.3
    * **Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, Detection Difficulty:** Same as 2.1.3
