## Mitigation Strategy: [Thorough Configuration Review and Hardening (Voyager-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/thorough_configuration_review_and_hardening__voyager-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Voyager Configuration Files:** Focus specifically on `config/voyager.php` and any BREAD-specific configuration files.
    2.  **Feature Disablement:**  Disable *Voyager-specific* features that are not absolutely necessary.  This includes:
        *   The built-in media manager (if not used or if a more secure alternative is implemented).
        *   Specific BREAD operations (add, edit, delete, read, browse) on a per-table basis.  If a table should only be viewable, disable "add," "edit," and "delete."
        *   Unused dashboard widgets or menu items.
        *   The database manager (if direct database access through Voyager is not required).
        *   Voyager's built-in documentation links (if not needed).
    3.  **Voyager Role and Permission Review:**  Examine and meticulously configure Voyager's role and permission system.  Create granular roles with the *least privilege* necessary.  Avoid relying solely on the default "admin" role.  Test permissions extensively by logging in as users with different roles.
    4.  **Voyager View Customization:**  Inspect and customize Voyager's Blade templates (`resources/views/vendor/voyager`).  Remove any potential exposure of sensitive data within these views.  Ensure proper output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities *within the Voyager interface itself*.
    5.  **Regular Voyager-Specific Review:** Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., every 3-6 months) focused solely on the Voyager configuration and its security implications.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-reliance on Voyager Defaults (Severity: High):** Reduces the attack surface by disabling unnecessary Voyager features.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Voyager-Specific) (Severity: High):** Ensures users can only access Voyager functionalities according to their assigned roles.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Voyager-Specific) (Severity: Medium-High):** Prevents sensitive data exposure through Voyager's interface.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Voyager-Specific) (Severity: High):** Limits the potential for users to gain unauthorized privileges within Voyager.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-reliance on Voyager Defaults:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Voyager-Specific):** High impact; prevents unauthorized actions within Voyager.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Voyager-Specific):** Medium-high impact; reduces data leaks within Voyager.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Voyager-Specific):** High impact; prevents privilege escalation within Voyager.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `config/voyager.php` reviewed; some features (documentation links) disabled.
    *   Basic roles defined, but permissions not thoroughly tested.
    *   Default Voyager views are used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive role/permission testing specific to Voyager functionalities.
    *   Voyager view customization to address potential information disclosure.
    *   Regular Voyager-specific configuration review schedule.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict BREAD Configuration and Data Handling (Voyager-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_bread_configuration_and_data_handling__voyager-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **BREAD Definition Review (Voyager):** For each model managed by Voyager, meticulously review the BREAD configuration. This is often defined within the model itself or in a separate configuration file *specifically for Voyager*.
    2.  **Voyager Field Visibility:**  Use Voyager's BREAD settings to *explicitly* control which fields are visible in Voyager's "Browse" and "Read" views.  *Never* expose sensitive fields through Voyager's interface.
    3.  **Voyager Editability Control:**  Use Voyager's BREAD settings to specify which fields are editable in Voyager's "Edit" and "Add" views.  Exclude sensitive fields.  Consider making fields read-only within Voyager even for administrators.
    4.  **Voyager-Specific Validation:** Implement validation rules *within Voyager's BREAD configuration*.  This adds a layer of validation specific to the Voyager interface, even if you have model-level validation.
    5.  **Voyager Relationship Management:** Carefully configure how relationships are displayed and managed *within Voyager*.  Ensure related data is not inadvertently exposed through Voyager's interface.
    6. **Data Sanitization within Voyager Views:** Before displaying *any* data within Voyager's views, ensure it's properly sanitized to prevent XSS. This is crucial even if you sanitize data elsewhere, as Voyager's views might have different handling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Data Exposure (Voyager-Specific) (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive data display through Voyager's BREAD interfaces.
    *   **Data Tampering (Voyager-Specific) (Severity: High):** Voyager-specific validation rules prevent malicious input within the Voyager interface.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Voyager-Specific) (Severity: High):** Data sanitization within Voyager views prevents XSS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Data Exposure (Voyager-Specific):** High impact; prevents data leaks within Voyager.
    *   **Data Tampering (Voyager-Specific):** High impact; protects data integrity within Voyager.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Voyager-Specific):** High impact; mitigates XSS within Voyager.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic BREAD configurations exist.
    *   Some fields hidden in Voyager's "Browse" view.
    *   Basic Laravel validation, but not Voyager-specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive review of all BREAD configurations to exclude *all* sensitive fields from Voyager.
    *   Implementation of Voyager-specific validation rules.
    *   Thorough testing of relationship handling within Voyager.
    *   Explicit data sanitization within Voyager's views.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Media Manager Configuration (Voyager-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_media_manager_configuration__voyager-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Voyager File Type Restriction:**  In `config/voyager.php`, strictly define allowed file types for Voyager's media manager using both MIME types and extensions.  Only allow the *absolute minimum* necessary.
    2.  **Voyager Storage Path:** Configure the storage path for Voyager's uploaded files.  Ideally, store files *outside* the web root.  If within the web root, use `.htaccess` (Apache) or equivalent server configuration to prevent execution of uploaded files. This configuration is often found within Voyager's settings.
    3.  **Voyager File Size Limits:** Set file size limits within Voyager's configuration.
    4.  **Voyager Filename Sanitization:** Implement filename sanitization *specifically for files uploaded through Voyager*.  Remove or replace dangerous characters.  Consider using a UUID or hash as the filename.
    5. **Disable Unused Features:** If features like cropping, resizing are not used within Voyager's media manager, disable them in the configuration.
    6. **Consider alternative:** If possible, use external service and disable Voyager's media manager.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload (Voyager-Specific) (Severity: High):** Prevents malicious file uploads through Voyager's media manager.

    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Voyager-Specific):** High impact; mitigates XSS.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Voyager-Specific):** Critical impact; prevents compromise.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic file type restrictions (images only).
    *   Files stored within the web root (`public/storage`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Stricter file type restrictions (MIME types and extensions) within Voyager's config.
    *   Moving storage outside the web root or using robust `.htaccess` rules, configured for Voyager.
    *   Filename sanitization specific to Voyager's uploads.
    *   Disabling unused features in Voyager's media manager.
    *   Considering external service.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhanced Logging and Auditing (Voyager-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/enhanced_logging_and_auditing__voyager-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Voyager Actions:** Determine which *Voyager-specific* actions to log.  This includes:
        *   Voyager user logins and logouts.
        *   Changes to Voyager roles and permissions.
        *   Data creation/modification/deletion performed *through Voyager's BREAD interfaces*.
        *   Actions within Voyager's media manager (file uploads, deletions).
        *   Any custom actions added to Voyager.
    2.  **Implement Voyager-Specific Logging:** Use Laravel's logging facilities, but focus on logging actions *within Voyager*.  You can often use Voyager's event system (hooks) to trigger logging when specific Voyager actions occur.  Log sufficient detail for forensic analysis (user, timestamp, affected data, parameters).
    3.  **Log Rotation:** Configure log rotation for Voyager-specific logs.
    4.  **Regular Voyager Log Review:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing logs specifically generated by Voyager for suspicious activity.

    *   **Non-Repudiation (Voyager-Specific):** Medium impact; strengthens accountability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Laravel logging, but no Voyager-specific logging.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementing custom logging for critical Voyager actions using Voyager's event system.
    *   Establishing a regular review process for Voyager-specific logs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify CSRF Protection (within Voyager)](./mitigation_strategies/verify_csrf_protection__within_voyager_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Confirm Laravel CSRF is Enabled:** Ensure Laravel's CSRF protection is enabled (usually the default).
    2.  **Voyager Forms: `@csrf` Directive:** Verify that *all* forms generated by Voyager (including BREAD forms) include the `@csrf` Blade directive. This is crucial for Voyager's built-in forms.
    3.  **Custom Forms within Voyager:** If you create any custom forms *within Voyager's views or controllers*, ensure they *also* include the `@csrf` directive.
    4. **Test:** Submit forms with and without the token to verify that protection is working *within the Voyager interface*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Voyager-Specific) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from tricking users into performing unintended actions *within Voyager*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Voyager-Specific):** High impact; mitigates CSRF within Voyager.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Laravel's CSRF protection is enabled.
