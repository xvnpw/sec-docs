# Attack Surface Analysis for thedevdojo/voyager

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through BREAD Interface](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_bread_interface.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries through input fields in Voyager's Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete (BREAD) interface, potentially gaining unauthorized access to or manipulating the database.

**Voyager's Contribution:** Voyager dynamically generates database queries based on user input within its BREAD forms. If this input is not properly sanitized or parameterized, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Example:**  An attacker could craft a malicious SQL query within a filter field of a BREAD table, allowing them to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.

**Impact:**  Data breach (access to sensitive information), data manipulation (modification or deletion of records), potential for complete database compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Laravel's Eloquent ORM and Query Builder: These tools provide built-in protection against SQL injection when used correctly. Avoid raw SQL queries where possible within Voyager's customization.
*   Parameterize Queries: Ensure all user-provided input used in database queries is properly parameterized.
*   Input Sanitization and Validation: Sanitize and validate all user input received through Voyager's forms on the server-side.
*   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Data Input in Voyager](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_data_input_in_voyager.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into data fields within Voyager's admin panel. These scripts can then be executed in the browsers of other administrators or even users of the front-end application if the data is displayed there.

**Voyager's Contribution:** Voyager allows administrators to input data through various fields in its BREAD interface, settings panels, and menu builders. If this input is not properly escaped when rendered, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into a category name or a blog post title through Voyager's interface. When another admin views this data, the script could execute, potentially stealing their session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account takeover (stealing admin session cookies), defacement of the admin panel or front-end application, redirection to malicious websites, data theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Output Encoding: Properly escape all user-generated content before rendering it in HTML. Use Laravel's built-in Blade templating engine's escaping mechanisms (`{{ }}`).
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
*   Input Validation and Sanitization: Sanitize and validate user input on the server-side to remove or neutralize potentially malicious scripts before they are stored.
*   Regular Security Audits: Scan for XSS vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual testing.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities in Media Manager](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities_in_media_manager.md)

**Description:** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) through Voyager's media manager, potentially gaining remote code execution on the server.

**Voyager's Contribution:** Voyager provides a built-in media manager that allows administrators to upload and manage files. If proper validation and security measures are not in place, this functionality can be abused.

**Example:** An attacker could upload a PHP web shell disguised as an image. If the web server is configured to execute PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker could then access this shell and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strict File Type Validation: Implement robust file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not just the file extension.
*   Secure File Storage: Store uploaded files outside of the webroot or in a location where script execution is disabled.
*   Rename Uploaded Files: Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable filenames and make it harder for attackers to access them directly.
*   Content Analysis and Scanning: Integrate with antivirus or malware scanning tools to analyze uploaded files for malicious content.
*   Limit Upload File Size: Enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

**Description:** If the default administrator credentials provided by Voyager are not changed during deployment, attackers can easily gain access to the admin panel.

**Voyager's Contribution:** Voyager often creates a default administrator user upon installation. If the developers do not immediately change these credentials, it presents an easily exploitable vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker could try common default credentials (e.g., `admin`/`password`) to log into the Voyager admin panel.

**Impact:** Full administrative access to the application, leading to complete compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Change Default Credentials Immediately: The first and most crucial step is to change the default administrator username and password during the initial setup of Voyager.
*   Enforce Strong Password Policies: Implement and enforce strong password policies for all administrator accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization (Potential in Settings or Hooks)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization__potential_in_settings_or_hooks_.md)

**Description:** If Voyager utilizes PHP's `unserialize` function on user-controlled data (e.g., within settings stored in the database or custom hooks), attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when unserialized, can lead to remote code execution.

**Voyager's Contribution:** While not a core feature, if developers extend Voyager's functionality using custom hooks or store complex data structures in settings that are later unserialized, this vulnerability could be introduced.

**Example:** An attacker could manipulate a setting value in the database to contain a malicious serialized object. When this setting is loaded and unserialized by Voyager, it could trigger arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid Unserializing Untrusted Data: The primary mitigation is to avoid using `unserialize` on data that originates from user input or external sources.
*   Input Validation and Sanitization: If deserialization is necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize the data before unserializing it.
*   Use Secure Serialization Formats: Consider using safer data serialization formats like JSON instead of PHP's native serialization.
