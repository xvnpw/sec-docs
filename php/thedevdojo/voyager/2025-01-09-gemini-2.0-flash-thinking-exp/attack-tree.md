## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Voyager [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_via_voyager__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved significant control over the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Voyager Admin Panel [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_voyager_admin_panel__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

This is a critical step as it provides the attacker with privileged access to manage the application through Voyager's interface.
    * Attack Vectors:
        * Exploit Authentication Weaknesses [HIGH RISK]:
            * Brute-force Login Credentials: Repeatedly attempting to log in with different username/password combinations. This is more likely if rate limiting is not implemented or if weak, common passwords are used.
            * Exploit Credential Stuffing [HIGH RISK]: Using previously compromised credentials (from other websites or breaches) to attempt login. This is effective if users reuse passwords across multiple platforms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

This allows the attacker to run commands directly on the server hosting the application, leading to complete system compromise.
    * Attack Vectors:
        * Exploit Insecure File Uploads (Media Manager) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]:
            * Upload Malicious PHP Files [HIGH RISK]: Uploading a PHP file containing malicious code (e.g., a web shell) through Voyager's media manager. This is possible if the system doesn't properly validate and sanitize uploaded files.
            * Upload Web Shells [HIGH RISK]: Specifically uploading a web shell, which is a script that allows remote command execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data and Configurations [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_and_configurations__high_risk_.md)

This allows the attacker to alter application data, settings, and configurations, potentially leading to data corruption, privilege escalation, or further attacks.
    * Attack Vectors:
        * Exploit Database Management Features (BREAD) [HIGH RISK]:
            * Inject Malicious SQL Queries (SQL Injection) [HIGH RISK]: Injecting malicious SQL code into input fields within Voyager's BREAD interface. If not properly sanitized, this code can be executed by the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute operating system commands in some cases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities.md)

This allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    * Attack Vectors:
        * Stored XSS via Voyager's Data Management [HIGH RISK]: Injecting malicious JavaScript code into database fields through Voyager's BREAD interface. When other users view this data within the Voyager admin panel or the front-end application, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
