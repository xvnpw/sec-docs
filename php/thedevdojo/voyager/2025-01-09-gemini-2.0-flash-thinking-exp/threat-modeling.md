# Threat Model Analysis for thedevdojo/voyager

## Threat: [Exploiting Default Administrative Credentials](./threats/exploiting_default_administrative_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to log into the Voyager admin panel using default credentials (e.g., username 'admin', password 'password' or similar commonly used defaults) if they haven't been changed after installation.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the administrative interface, allowing the attacker to manage all data, users, and settings within the application. This can lead to data breaches, defacement, or complete takeover of the application.

**Voyager Component Affected:** Authentication Module (specifically the login functionality).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Force a password change upon the first login to the Voyager admin panel.
*   Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials during the installation process.
*   Consider removing or disabling default user accounts after the initial setup.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Upload via Media Manager](./threats/unrestricted_file_upload_via_media_manager.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, web shells) through Voyager's Media Manager due to insufficient file type validation or lack of restrictions on uploadable content.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the application, leading to complete server compromise, data theft, or further attacks on the infrastructure.

**Voyager Component Affected:** Media Manager (specifically the file upload functionality).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict file type validation based on content and extension (not just the extension).
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot to prevent direct execution.
*   Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` or server configuration).
*   Consider using a dedicated storage service for uploaded files with appropriate security controls.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in BREAD Functionality](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_bread_functionality.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the IDs in URLs or form data to access or modify data entries they are not authorized to interact with through Voyager's Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete (BREAD) interface. This happens due to insufficient authorization checks within Voyager's BREAD implementation.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data belonging to other users or the system itself.

**Voyager Component Affected:** BREAD Controllers and related routing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust authorization checks in Voyager's BREAD controllers to verify that the current user has the necessary permissions to access or modify the requested resource.
*   Avoid directly exposing internal database IDs in URLs. Use UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers if necessary.
*   Leverage Voyager's permission system effectively to control access based on roles.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in BREAD Forms](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_bread_forms.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits extra fields in a BREAD form that are not intended to be modified, potentially altering sensitive database columns due to insufficient protection against mass assignment within Voyager's BREAD handling.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of database records, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data corruption, or security breaches.

**Voyager Component Affected:** BREAD Controllers (specifically the data handling logic during create and update operations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize Laravel's `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties in Eloquent models, ensuring Voyager's BREAD controllers respect these definitions.
*   Carefully review and sanitize all user inputs before processing them in BREAD controllers.
*   Avoid directly passing request data to model update or create methods without filtering within Voyager's BREAD logic.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Menu Builder](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_menu_builder.md)

**Description:** An attacker with administrative privileges injects malicious JavaScript code into menu items through Voyager's Menu Builder. This script is then executed in the browsers of other administrators accessing the admin panel.

**Impact:** Account compromise of other administrators, potential for further attacks on the application or its users through the compromised admin account.

**Voyager Component Affected:** Menu Builder Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding when handling menu item data within Voyager's Menu Builder.
*   Use a templating engine that automatically escapes output by default in the Voyager admin panel views.
*   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Custom Database Queries (if used within Voyager context)](./threats/sql_injection_in_custom_database_queries__if_used_within_voyager_context_.md)

**Description:** If developers use Voyager's functionality to execute custom database queries without proper sanitization of user-supplied input, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code. This is especially relevant if custom BREAD types or hooks are implemented without careful consideration for SQL injection.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, data manipulation, or even complete database takeover.

**Voyager Component Affected:** Potentially any component where custom database queries are executed based on user input within the Voyager context (e.g., custom BREAD implementations, custom controllers interacting with Voyager models, custom hooks).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when executing database queries with user-provided input, especially within custom Voyager extensions.
*   Avoid concatenating user input directly into SQL queries within Voyager-related code.
*   Use Laravel's query builder or Eloquent ORM which provide built-in protection against SQL injection when interacting with the database from within Voyager components.
