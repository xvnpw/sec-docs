# Threat Model Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Threat: [Malicious Short URL Creation and Redirection](./threats/malicious_short_url_creation_and_redirection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could use the YOURLS instance to create short URLs that redirect to malicious websites. This can be done by directly using the URL shortening form or potentially through automated scripts if there are no sufficient rate limits or input validation *within YOURLS*.

**Impact:** Users clicking on these short URLs would be redirected to phishing sites, malware download locations, or other harmful content, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or financial loss for the users.

**Affected Component:** Core URL shortening functionality, specifically the `yourls-loader.php` script responsible for handling short URL creation and redirection.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation on the long URL to be shortened *within YOURLS*, checking for known malicious patterns or blacklisted domains.
*   Implement rate limiting on short URL creation requests *within YOURLS* to prevent abuse by automated scripts.
*   Consider requiring some form of authentication or CAPTCHA for URL shortening *within YOURLS*, especially for public instances.
*   Regularly monitor created short URLs for suspicious redirection targets.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attacks on Admin Credentials](./threats/brute-force_attacks_on_admin_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to guess the administrator username and password to gain access to the YOURLS admin interface. This involves repeatedly submitting login attempts to the admin login form *provided by YOURLS*.

**Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker full control over the YOURLS instance, allowing them to create/delete short URLs, modify settings, potentially inject malicious code, or even compromise the underlying server if vulnerabilities exist.

**Affected Component:** The admin authentication module, likely involving files like `admin/index.php` and the associated authentication logic *within YOURLS*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts.
*   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts *within YOURLS*.
*   Consider implementing CAPTCHA on the login form *within YOURLS* to prevent automated brute-force attacks.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication for the admin interface (may require a plugin).

## Threat: [CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) in Admin Interface](./threats/csrf__cross-site_request_forgery__in_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trick an authenticated administrator into performing unintended actions on the YOURLS instance. This is done by crafting malicious links or embedding requests on other websites that, when clicked by the logged-in admin, execute actions within the YOURLS admin panel without their knowledge.

**Impact:** An attacker could potentially delete short URLs, modify settings, create new admin accounts, or perform other administrative actions, disrupting the service or gaining unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** Various components within the admin interface *provided by YOURLS* that handle actions like deleting links, modifying settings, and user management (e.g., files in the `admin` directory).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement CSRF tokens for all sensitive actions within the admin interface *within YOURLS*.
*   Ensure that GET requests are not used for actions that modify data *within YOURLS's admin panel*.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of `config.php`](./threats/insecure_handling_of__config_php_.md)

**Description:** If the `config.php` file, which contains database credentials and other sensitive information, is not properly protected, an attacker could gain access to it. This could be due to web server misconfiguration *or* vulnerabilities in YOURLS's file handling (less likely, but possible if YOURLS code directly exposes the file).

**Impact:** Access to `config.php` would allow an attacker to compromise the database, potentially gaining access to all short URLs, user data (if any), and other sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Web server configuration and file system permissions related to the `config.php` file *and potentially YOURLS's file inclusion logic if flawed*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that the web server is configured to prevent direct access to `.php` files in the configuration directory (or the `config.php` file itself).
*   Set appropriate file system permissions on `config.php` to restrict access to the web server user only.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Plugin Functionality](./threats/path_traversal_via_plugin_functionality.md)

**Description:** A poorly implemented plugin might allow an attacker to access files or directories outside of the intended web directory. This could be achieved by manipulating file paths passed to plugin functions. This is included as YOURLS provides the plugin architecture.

**Impact:** Attackers could potentially read sensitive configuration files, access server logs, or even upload malicious files to the server.

**Affected Component:** Plugin architecture *provided by YOURLS* and specific plugin functions that handle file paths or access the file system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization within plugin code, especially when dealing with file paths.
*   Ensure plugins use secure file handling practices.
*   Regularly audit plugin code for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Excessive Redirects](./threats/denial_of_service_through_excessive_redirects.md)

**Description:** An attacker could create a short URL that redirects to another short URL, creating a redirect loop. When a user clicks on the initial short URL, their browser or the YOURLS server could get stuck in an infinite redirect loop, potentially causing performance issues or denial of service.

**Impact:** Can lead to server overload, browser crashes for users caught in the loop, and general service disruption.

**Affected Component:** The redirection logic within `yourls-loader.php`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement checks *within YOURLS* to detect and prevent the creation of redirect loops.
*   Limit the number of redirects allowed for a single short URL *within YOURLS*.
