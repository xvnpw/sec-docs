## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit YOURLS Core Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_yourls_core_functionality.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit YOURLS Core Functionality**

*   This node represents the attacker targeting inherent weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the core YOURLS application code. Successfully exploiting this node can lead to various impactful outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Redirection](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_redirection.md)

**High-Risk Path: Malicious Redirection**

*   **Attack Step:** Create short URLs redirecting to attacker-controlled sites (phishing, malware).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
    *   Can lead to user compromise through phishing attacks, credential theft, or malware infections.
    *   Damages the reputation of the application using YOURLS.
*   **Effort:** Low
    *   Requires basic understanding of the YOURLS interface or API.
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   Can be detected by monitoring redirect destinations, but attackers can use URL obfuscation or redirection chains to evade detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known YOURLS Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_yourls_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

**High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Known YOURLS Vulnerabilities (CVEs)**

*   **Attack Step:** Leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in YOURLS core (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   Depends heavily on the patch status of the YOURLS instance. Older, unpatched versions are highly susceptible.
    *   Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available.
*   **Impact:** High
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on behalf of users.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) can allow attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
    *   In some cases, known vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), granting the attacker complete control over the server.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available and easy to use.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   Requires understanding of web vulnerabilities and how to use existing exploits.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   Can be detected by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) if their signatures are up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit YOURLS Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_yourls_plugins.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit YOURLS Plugins**

*   This node represents the attacker targeting vulnerabilities within the plugins installed on the YOURLS instance. Plugins, being third-party code, can introduce security weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Installed Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_installed_plugins.md)

**High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerable Installed Plugins**

*   **Attack Step:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in installed YOURLS plugins (e.g., SQL injection, RCE).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   Depends on the number and security of the installed plugins. Popular or outdated plugins are more likely to have known vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** High
    *   SQL injection can allow attackers to access or modify the database, potentially exposing sensitive application data.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) can grant the attacker complete control over the server.
    *   Other vulnerabilities like XSS or insecure direct object references can also be present in plugins.
*   **Effort:** Medium
    *   Requires identifying vulnerable plugins and finding or developing exploits. This may involve some reverse engineering or vulnerability research.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   Requires understanding of plugin architectures and common web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   Can be detected by WAFs and intrusion detection systems if signatures for the specific plugin vulnerabilities exist.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise YOURLS Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_yourls_admin_credentials.md)

**Critical Node: Compromise YOURLS Admin Credentials**

*   This node represents the attacker's goal of gaining administrative access to the YOURLS instance. Achieving this grants significant control over the URL shortening service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Step:** Leverage flaws in YOURLS authentication to gain admin access.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   Depends on the security of the YOURLS version and the presence of undiscovered authentication flaws.
*   **Impact:** High
    *   Directly grants the attacker full administrative control over the YOURLS instance.
    *   Allows the attacker to perform any administrative action, including creating malicious redirects, modifying settings, managing users, and potentially uploading malicious plugins.
*   **Effort:** Medium
    *   Requires identifying and exploiting subtle flaws in the authentication logic. This often involves careful code analysis and understanding of authentication mechanisms.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   Requires a good understanding of authentication protocols and common bypass techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   Can be difficult to detect as it might not involve traditional brute-force attempts. Detection might rely on identifying unusual request patterns or exploiting specific vulnerability signatures.
