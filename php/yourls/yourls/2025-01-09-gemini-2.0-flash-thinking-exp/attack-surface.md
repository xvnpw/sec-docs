# Attack Surface Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirection via Shortened URLs](./attack_surfaces/open_redirection_via_shortened_urls.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can use the YOURLS service to create short links that redirect to malicious websites.
    *   **How YOURLS Contributes:** The core functionality of YOURLS is to shorten URLs, making it a potential tool for redirecting users.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a short link using YOURLS that redirects to a phishing page mimicking a legitimate bank login. They then distribute this short link via email or social media.
    *   **Impact:** Users may be tricked into visiting malicious websites, leading to credential theft, malware infection, or other harmful outcomes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement strict validation and sanitization of the target URL provided by users.
        *   URL Whitelisting/Blacklisting: Maintain a whitelist of allowed domains or a blacklist of known malicious domains.
        *   Display Target URL: Consider displaying the full target URL before redirection or providing a preview mechanism.
        *   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the URL shortening service for malicious purposes.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Custom Keywords](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_custom_keywords.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the custom keywords for short URLs, which are then executed in the browsers of users viewing the stats page or other areas where the keyword is displayed.
    *   **How YOURLS Contributes:** YOURLS allows users to define custom keywords, providing an input vector. If these keywords are not properly handled, they can be used for XSS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a short link with a custom keyword containing a malicious JavaScript payload. When a user visits the statistics page for this short link, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of stats pages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Output Encoding/Escaping: Implement proper output encoding or escaping of custom keywords when displaying them in HTML contexts.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        *   Input Validation: While primarily for preventing other issues, some input validation on the character set allowed in custom keywords can help.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities in plugins installed on the YOURLS instance can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How YOURLS Contributes:** YOURLS has a plugin system that allows extending its functionality. This inherently introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in third-party code.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the YOURLS installation, including access to the database and the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly Update Plugins: Keep all installed plugins up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Install Plugins from Trusted Sources: Only install plugins from reputable sources and developers.
        *   Minimize Plugin Usage: Only install necessary plugins to reduce the attack surface.
        *   Security Audits of Plugins: If developing custom plugins, conduct thorough security audits and follow secure coding practices.
        *   Disable Unused Plugins: Disable or remove plugins that are no longer in use.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the YOURLS API's authentication or authorization mechanisms can allow unauthorized access and manipulation of data.
    *   **How YOURLS Contributes:** YOURLS provides an API for programmatic interaction. Flaws in its security can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the API authentication to delete short links belonging to other users or create malicious short links.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of short links, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure API Keys: Ensure API keys are generated securely, stored safely, and transmitted over HTTPS.
        *   Proper Authentication and Authorization: Implement robust authentication and authorization checks for all API endpoints, ensuring users can only access resources they are permitted to.
        *   Input Validation on API Endpoints: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received through the API.
        *   Rate Limiting on API Endpoints: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks via the API.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can gain administrative access if the default administrative credentials are not changed after installation.
    *   **How YOURLS Contributes:** YOURLS, like many applications, often has default credentials set during the initial installation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default username and password to log into the YOURLS admin panel and gain full control of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the YOURLS installation, allowing attackers to manipulate data, create malicious links, and potentially gain access to the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Force Password Change on First Login: Implement a mechanism to force the administrator to change the default password upon initial login.
        *   Clear Instructions on Secure Setup: Provide clear instructions during the installation process about the importance of changing default credentials.
        *   Regular Security Awareness: Remind administrators to review and update passwords periodically.
