# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change Default Admin Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/change_default_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Log in to your yourls admin panel using the default username (`admin`) and password (`password`).
    2.  Navigate to the "Users" or "Profile" section within the yourls admin dashboard (usually accessible via the top right menu or a "Users" link in the sidebar).
    3.  Locate the administrator account (often named "admin").
    4.  Edit the administrator account settings.
    5.  Change the username to a unique and non-obvious value. Avoid using common usernames like "administrator", "webmaster", etc.
    6.  Generate a strong, unique password. Use a password manager to create and store a complex password consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    7.  Update the administrator account with the new username and password.
    8.  Log out and log back in using the new credentials to verify the change.
    9.  Securely store the new administrator credentials.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Default Credentials Exploitation (High Severity):** Attackers can easily gain administrative access to your yourls instance by using well-known default credentials. This allows them to fully control the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Default Credentials Exploitation (High Reduction):**  Completely eliminates the risk of exploitation via default credentials.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. yourls *has* default credentials upon initial installation, but requires a login to access the admin panel.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** yourls does not enforce changing default credentials upon first login or provide guidance on strong password creation within the application itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep yourls Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_yourls_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly check for new releases of yourls on the official yourls website or GitHub repository.
    2.  Subscribe to yourls security mailing lists or monitor security announcements related to yourls.
    3.  Before updating, back up your yourls installation, including the database and files.
    4.  Follow the yourls update instructions provided in the release notes or documentation. This usually involves replacing files and potentially running database migrations.
    5.  After updating, test your yourls installation thoroughly to ensure everything is working correctly and that the update process was successful.
    6.  Schedule regular updates to ensure you are always running the latest secure version of yourls.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated software is a primary target for attackers. Updates often contain patches for known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by patching known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented as an automated process within yourls. Requires manual user action.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** yourls does not have an automatic update mechanism or in-dashboard update notifications. Users must manually check for and apply updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debug Mode in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debug_mode_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Open the `config.php` file in your yourls installation directory.
    2.  Locate the line that defines the `YOURLS_DEBUG` constant.
    3.  Ensure that `YOURLS_DEBUG` is set to `false` for production environments. It should look like: `define( 'YOURLS_DEBUG', false );`
    4.  Save the `config.php` file.
    5.  Verify that debug mode is disabled by accessing your yourls instance and checking that error messages are not overly verbose or revealing sensitive information.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Debug mode can expose sensitive information such as file paths, database queries, and internal application workings in error messages. Attackers can use this information to gain a better understanding of the system and identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Reduction):** Prevents the exposure of sensitive information through debug messages in production environments.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Configurable in `config.php`. Default is often `true` for development, requiring manual change for production.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** yourls does not automatically disable debug mode in production environments or provide warnings about leaving it enabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [URL Blacklisting/Filtering](./mitigation_strategies/url_blacklistingfiltering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify sources for URL blacklists. These can be publicly available lists or lists you curate based on your specific needs and threat landscape.
    2.  Implement a mechanism within yourls (either through a plugin or custom code modification) to check URLs against the blacklist before shortening them.
    3.  When a user submits a URL for shortening, the system should:
        *   Fetch the domain from the submitted URL.
        *   Check if the domain or the full URL is present in the blacklist.
        *   If the URL or domain is blacklisted, prevent the URL from being shortened and display an error message to the user, explaining why the URL was blocked.
    4.  Regularly update the blacklist to ensure it remains effective against new and emerging malicious domains.
    5.  Consider allowing administrators to manually add or remove URLs/domains from the blacklist through the admin interface.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious URL Shortening (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers can use your yourls instance to shorten URLs that redirect to phishing sites, malware distribution sites, or other harmful content.
        *   **Spam and Abuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents the use of your yourls instance for spreading spam or other unwanted content.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious URL Shortening (Medium to High Reduction):**  Reduces the risk of your service being used to distribute malicious URLs. Effectiveness depends on the blacklist quality.
        *   **Spam and Abuse (Medium Reduction):**  Helps mitigate spam and abuse by preventing the shortening of URLs associated with unwanted content.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented in yourls core. Requires plugin or custom code development.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** yourls does not have built-in URL blacklisting or filtering functionality. This needs to be added through extensions or modifications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting for Admin Login](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_for_admin_login.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement rate limiting logic within yourls code or using a yourls plugin.
    2.  Track login attempts from each IP address or user account.
    3.  Set a threshold for the maximum number of failed login attempts allowed within a specific time period (e.g., 5 failed attempts in 5 minutes).
    4.  If the threshold is exceeded for an IP address or user account, temporarily block further login attempts from that source for a defined period (e.g., 15 minutes).
    5.  Display a message to the user indicating that their login attempts are being rate-limited and to try again later.
    6.  Consider logging blocked login attempts for security monitoring and analysis.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Brute-Force Password Attacks (High Severity):** Rate limiting makes brute-force attacks significantly more difficult and time-consuming by limiting the number of login attempts an attacker can make in a given timeframe.
        *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  Rate limiting can also help mitigate credential stuffing attacks, where attackers use lists of compromised usernames and passwords to try and gain access to accounts.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Brute-Force Password Attacks (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks.
        *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks (Medium to High Reduction):**  Makes credential stuffing attacks less efficient.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented in yourls core. Requires plugin or custom code development.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** yourls does not have built-in rate limiting for admin login attempts. This needs to be added through extensions or modifications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider Captcha for URL Shortening (If Publicly Accessible)](./mitigation_strategies/consider_captcha_for_url_shortening__if_publicly_accessible_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate a CAPTCHA service (e.g., reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha) into your yourls URL shortening form if it's publicly accessible.
    2.  When a user submits a URL for shortening, present a CAPTCHA challenge before processing the request.
    3.  Verify the CAPTCHA response on the server-side before shortening the URL.
    4.  If the CAPTCHA verification fails, display an error message and prevent URL shortening.
    5.  Configure the CAPTCHA service to balance security and user experience (adjust difficulty level, consider invisible CAPTCHA options).
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Automated Abuse (Medium Severity):** CAPTCHA prevents automated bots from abusing the URL shortening service for spam, malicious URL generation, or other unwanted activities.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive URL Creation (Medium Severity):** CAPTCHA can help prevent DoS attacks that attempt to overload the server by generating a large number of URLs automatically.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Automated Abuse (Medium Reduction):**  Significantly reduces automated abuse of the URL shortening functionality.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive URL Creation (Medium Reduction):**  Helps mitigate DoS attempts through automated URL creation.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented in yourls core. Requires plugin or custom code development.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** yourls does not have built-in CAPTCHA integration for URL shortening. This needs to be added through extensions or modifications.
