## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Admin Panel Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_admin_panel_weaknesses__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Brute-Force Admin Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Weak Password Policy / Default Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to the YOURLS admin panel using common default usernames (like 'admin') and passwords (like 'password', '123456') or weak passwords easily guessed or obtained from password lists.
            *   **Exploitation:** Automated tools are used to try numerous username/password combinations rapidly. If default credentials are not changed or weak passwords are used, attackers gain immediate admin access.
        *   **Lack of Rate Limiting on Login Attempts [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers exploit the absence of rate limiting on login attempts to perform brute-force attacks without being blocked.
            *   **Exploitation:** Automated brute-force tools can make unlimited login attempts until successful credentials are found.
    *   **Exploit Unpatched Admin Panel Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in YOURLS Admin Interface (CVEs, publicly disclosed) [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Outdated YOURLS Version [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in older versions of YOURLS that have been publicly disclosed (CVEs).
                *   **Exploitation:** Publicly available exploits or vulnerability scanners are used to identify and exploit these known weaknesses in the outdated admin panel, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), unauthorized access, or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Unpatched API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in YOURLS API (CVEs, publicly disclosed) [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Outdated YOURLS Version [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in older versions of YOURLS API that have been publicly disclosed (CVEs).
                *   **Exploitation:** Publicly available exploits or vulnerability scanners are used to identify and exploit these known weaknesses in the outdated API, potentially leading to unauthorized access to API functionalities, data manipulation, or even server compromise depending on the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable Plugin Installation [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Installing Unvetted/Malicious Plugins [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers trick administrators into installing plugins from untrusted sources that are either intentionally malicious (backdoors, malware) or contain security vulnerabilities.
            *   **Exploitation:** Social engineering tactics or compromised plugin repositories are used to distribute malicious plugins. Once installed, these plugins can provide backdoors, introduce vulnerabilities, or directly compromise the YOURLS application and server.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugins [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Plugins (CVEs, publicly disclosed) [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in installed YOURLS plugins that have been publicly disclosed (CVEs).
            *   **Exploitation:** Publicly available exploits or vulnerability scanners are used to identify and exploit these known weaknesses in vulnerable plugins, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), unauthorized access, or data manipulation, often within the context and permissions of the YOURLS application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Core YOURLS Code Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_core_yourls_code_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Unpatched Core Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in YOURLS Core (CVEs, publicly disclosed) [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Outdated YOURLS Version [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in older versions of the core YOURLS application that have been publicly disclosed (CVEs).
                *   **Exploitation:** Publicly available exploits or vulnerability scanners are used to identify and exploit these known weaknesses in the outdated core code, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), database compromise, or full server takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Phishing for Admin Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers send deceptive emails or create fake login pages that mimic the YOURLS admin panel to trick administrators into revealing their usernames and passwords.
        *   **Exploitation:**  Attackers use social engineering techniques to make the phishing attempts convincing. Once admin credentials are obtained, they can directly log in to the YOURLS admin panel and gain full control.
    *   **Tricking Admin into Installing Malicious Plugin [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use social engineering to convince administrators to install a malicious plugin, often disguised as a legitimate or useful extension for YOURLS.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers might pose as trusted developers, use fake plugin marketplaces, or exploit administrator trust to get malicious plugins installed. Once installed, the plugin can execute malicious code, create backdoors, or introduce vulnerabilities.
