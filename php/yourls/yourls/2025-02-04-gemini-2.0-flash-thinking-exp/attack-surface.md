# Attack Surface Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Attack Surface: [Weak Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for the administrator account, providing unauthorized access.
*   **Yourls Contribution:** Yourls configuration relies on `config.php` to set initial administrator usernames and passwords.  The application itself doesn't enforce strong password policies or mandatory initial password changes.
*   **Example:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Yourls admin panel using common default credentials like "admin/password" or "administrator/yourls" and successfully gains access because the administrator did not change them.
*   **Impact:** Full administrative access to Yourls. Attackers can control URL redirection, modify application settings, inject malicious code (via plugins or settings), and potentially compromise the underlying server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Password Change:**  Implement a mandatory password change upon initial setup, forcing administrators to set strong, unique credentials.
    *   **Strong Password Policy:**  Document and recommend strong password policies for administrator accounts.
    *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Exposure](./attack_surfaces/api_key_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentional disclosure or leakage of Yourls API keys, granting unauthorized API access.
*   **Yourls Contribution:** Yourls uses API keys for authentication to its API endpoints. The application's design relies on the secrecy of these keys for API security.
*   **Example:** An API key is accidentally embedded in client-side JavaScript code, committed to a public code repository, or exposed in server logs. An attacker discovers this key and uses it to programmatically shorten malicious URLs or access private statistics via the Yourls API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Yourls API functionalities. Attackers can shorten URLs for malicious purposes (spam, phishing), retrieve usage statistics, and potentially perform other API actions depending on the exposed endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Key Generation:** Generate strong, unpredictable API keys.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Store API keys securely server-side. Avoid embedding them in client-side code or version control. Use environment variables or secure configuration management.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement a mechanism for administrators to periodically rotate API keys.
    *   **API Access Control:** Implement server-level access controls (e.g., IP whitelisting) to restrict API access to authorized sources if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Panel](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_panel.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into the Yourls admin panel that are executed in the browsers of administrators, leading to account compromise.
*   **Yourls Contribution:** Yourls admin panel handles user input in various fields (custom keywords, link titles, plugin settings). Insufficient input validation and output encoding within the Yourls admin panel code can create XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a custom keyword field. When an administrator views the list of shortened URLs in the admin panel, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on behalf of the administrator.
*   **Impact:** Administrator account compromise through session hijacking, defacement of the admin panel, redirection of administrators to malicious sites, and potentially further exploitation of the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization for all user-supplied data within the admin panel. Sanitize and validate input based on expected data types and formats.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all output displayed in the admin panel, especially user-generated content, using context-aware output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (Introduced by Plugin System)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__introduced_by_plugin_system_.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in third-party Yourls plugins, exploitable through the Yourls plugin system.
*   **Yourls Contribution:** Yourls' plugin architecture, while extending functionality, inherently introduces an attack surface. Yourls core code is responsible for loading and executing plugin code, and vulnerabilities in plugins can directly impact the security of the entire Yourls installation.
*   **Example:** A poorly developed plugin contains an SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through the plugin's functionality, gaining unauthorized access to the Yourls database and potentially compromising sensitive data or the entire application.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin vulnerability, including data breaches, arbitrary code execution on the server, denial of service, and complete compromise of the Yourls installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be **Critical** depending on the plugin and vulnerability type)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Security Audits:**  Regularly audit installed plugins for known vulnerabilities and security best practices.
    *   **Trusted Plugin Sources:**  Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources. Exercise caution with plugins from unknown or unverified developers.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:**  Maintain all installed plugins up-to-date. Plugin updates often include critical security patches.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Use:**  Reduce the number of installed plugins to the minimum necessary functionality to reduce the overall attack surface.
    *   **Plugin Security Reviews (Development):** For developers creating Yourls plugins, implement secure coding practices and conduct thorough security reviews and testing before releasing plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Debug/Errors (Sensitive Data Exposure)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_debugerrors__sensitive_data_exposure_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive information, such as database credentials or internal paths, through debug messages or improperly handled error pages.
*   **Yourls Contribution:** Yourls error handling and debug settings can, if misconfigured, lead to the disclosure of sensitive information within error messages displayed to users or logged in an insecure manner.
*   **Example:** If debug mode is enabled in a production environment, or error reporting is set to display detailed errors, a database connection error might inadvertently reveal database credentials or file paths in the error message displayed on a public web page.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration details, database credentials, file paths, and internal application structure. This information can be leveraged by attackers to further exploit the system and gain deeper access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (Critical if database credentials or API keys are exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** Ensure debug mode is completely disabled in production environments.
    *   **Custom Error Pages:** Configure custom error pages that do not reveal any sensitive information or application internals.
    *   **Secure Error Logging:** Implement secure server-side error logging. Log errors to secure files with restricted access and avoid logging sensitive data in plain text.
    *   **Minimize Verbose Error Reporting:** Configure error reporting to a minimal level in production, logging errors for debugging purposes but preventing detailed error messages from being displayed to users.
