# Deep Analysis: Strong, Unique Passwords & 2FA for YOURLS

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of the "Strong, Unique Passwords & 2FA" mitigation strategy in securing a YOURLS installation against common authentication-related threats.  This includes identifying gaps in the current implementation, assessing the residual risk, and recommending concrete steps to achieve full implementation and maximize security.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the password policy and 2FA implementation within YOURLS, encompassing:

*   YOURLS's built-in password configuration options (`config.php`).
*   The installation, configuration, and enforcement of 2FA plugins.
*   The interaction between password policies and 2FA.
*   The threats directly mitigated by this strategy.

This analysis *does not* cover broader security aspects like server hardening, network security, or other YOURLS plugins unrelated to authentication.  It also assumes a standard YOURLS installation without significant custom modifications.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Reiterate the identified threats and their severity, focusing on how the mitigation strategy addresses them.
2.  **Implementation Gap Analysis:**  Compare the described "ideal" implementation with the "currently implemented" state, highlighting specific deficiencies.
3.  **Technical Analysis:**  Examine the YOURLS codebase (where relevant) and plugin mechanisms to understand how password policies and 2FA are technically enforced.
4.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the remaining risk after full implementation of the mitigation strategy.
5.  **Recommendations:**  Provide actionable recommendations to close the implementation gaps and further enhance security.
6.  **Limitations:** Acknowledge any limitations of the analysis.

## 2. Threat Modeling Review

The mitigation strategy directly addresses the following threats:

*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):**  Automated attempts to guess passwords by trying numerous combinations.  Strong passwords significantly increase the time required for a successful brute-force attack, while 2FA renders it practically impossible without access to the second factor.
*   **Credential Stuffing (Severity: High):**  Using stolen credentials (username/password pairs) from other breaches to attempt access.  Unique passwords prevent this, and 2FA adds a layer of protection even if credentials are compromised.
*   **Unauthorized Account Access (Severity: High):**  The overarching threat that encompasses various attack vectors, including brute-force, credential stuffing, and exploiting weak passwords.  This strategy directly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access.
*   **Phishing (Severity: Medium):**  Tricking users into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails or websites.  While 2FA doesn't prevent phishing itself, it significantly reduces the impact, as the attacker still needs the second factor.  A phished password alone is insufficient.

## 3. Implementation Gap Analysis

The following gaps exist between the ideal and current implementations:

| Feature                     | Ideal Implementation                                  | Current Implementation                               | Gap Severity |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Password Length             | Minimum 12 characters                               | Minimum 8 characters                                | Medium       |
| Password Complexity         | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols required      | Numbers required, others not enforced                 | High         |
| Common Password Blacklist   | Blacklist of common/compromised passwords             | No blacklist implemented                              | Medium       |
| 2FA Enforcement             | Mandatory for all administrative accounts             | Optional                                              | **Critical** |
| 2FA Plugin Configuration    | Fully configured and tested                          | Installed, but effectiveness depends on user action | Medium       |
| User Education              | Clear instructions and training on 2FA setup/usage   | Not explicitly mentioned, assumed to be adequate      | Low          |

The most critical gap is the lack of mandatory 2FA enforcement.  Optional 2FA provides minimal security benefit, as attackers will target accounts without 2FA enabled.

## 4. Technical Analysis

*   **`config.php` Password Settings:** YOURLS uses the `YOURLS_USER_PASSWORDS` array in `config.php` to store usernames and hashed passwords.  Password hashing is handled by the `yourls_hash_password()` function, which (by default) uses PHP's `password_hash()` function with the `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` algorithm (currently bcrypt).  This is a strong hashing algorithm.  The minimum length and character requirements are checked *before* hashing.  The relevant code sections are in `includes/functions-password.php` and `includes/functions-auth.php`.

*   **2FA Plugin Mechanism:** YOURLS's plugin system allows for extending functionality without modifying core code.  2FA plugins typically hook into the authentication process (using YOURLS's action and filter hooks) to add the second-factor verification step.  They usually store 2FA secrets associated with user accounts in the database.  The specific implementation details vary between plugins, but they generally follow this pattern.  The Google Authenticator plugin, for example, likely uses the `yourls_pre_auth_successful` hook to inject the 2FA check.

*   **Enforcement:**  The crucial aspect of 2FA enforcement is typically handled within the 2FA plugin itself.  The plugin needs to provide a mechanism (e.g., a setting in the admin interface) to make 2FA mandatory.  If this setting is not enabled, the plugin might only *offer* 2FA as an option, leaving a significant security vulnerability.

## 5. Residual Risk Assessment

Even with full implementation of this mitigation strategy, some residual risks remain:

*   **Compromised 2FA Device:** If an attacker gains physical access to the user's 2FA device (e.g., phone) or compromises the device remotely, 2FA can be bypassed.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Attackers might attempt to trick users into revealing their 2FA codes or bypassing 2FA through social engineering tactics.
*   **Vulnerabilities in the 2FA Plugin:**  A vulnerability in the chosen 2FA plugin itself could be exploited to bypass 2FA.  This highlights the importance of using well-maintained and reputable plugins.
*   **Server-Side Attacks:**  This strategy primarily focuses on authentication.  Vulnerabilities in YOURLS itself, the web server, or the underlying operating system could still lead to compromise, even with strong authentication.
*   **Database Compromise:** If the database is compromised, the attacker will have the password hashes. While the hashes are strong, they are not immune to cracking, especially if the password is weak.

## 6. Recommendations

To fully implement the mitigation strategy and minimize risk, the following actions are recommended:

1.  **Enforce Strong Password Policy:**
    *   Modify `config.php` (or use a plugin that manages this) to enforce:
        *   Minimum password length of 12 characters.
        *   Requirement for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
    *   Implement a common password blacklist.  Consider using a service like the Pwned Passwords API (via a plugin) or a local list.

2.  **Mandatory 2FA:**
    *   **Immediately enable mandatory 2FA** within the Google Authenticator plugin settings (or whichever 2FA plugin is used).  This is the highest priority action.
    *   Verify that the plugin correctly enforces 2FA for *all* administrative accounts.  Test this by attempting to log in without providing the 2FA code.

3.  **Plugin Review:**
    *   Ensure the chosen 2FA plugin is actively maintained and has a good security track record.  Consider alternatives if necessary.
    *   Regularly update the plugin to the latest version to address any security vulnerabilities.

4.  **User Education:**
    *   Provide clear, concise instructions to all administrators on how to set up and use 2FA with their chosen authenticator app.
    *   Emphasize the importance of keeping their 2FA device secure.

5.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Periodically review the YOURLS configuration and plugin settings to ensure that the security measures are still in place and effective.
    *   Consider performing penetration testing to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

6.  **Session Management:**
    * Implement secure session management practices, such as short session timeouts and secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure). While not directly part of this mitigation, it complements it.

7. **Consider Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * A WAF can help to mitigate brute-force attacks at the network level, providing an additional layer of defense.

## 7. Limitations

*   This analysis is based on the provided information and a general understanding of YOURLS.  Specific configurations or custom modifications might affect the accuracy of the assessment.
*   The analysis does not include a full code review of YOURLS or the 2FA plugin.  Undiscovered vulnerabilities might exist.
*   The effectiveness of 2FA depends on the user's adherence to security best practices.

By addressing the identified gaps and implementing the recommendations, the security of the YOURLS installation against authentication-related threats will be significantly enhanced. The most critical step is to enforce mandatory 2FA immediately.
