## Attack Tree Path: [1. Abuse Plugin Functionality [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__abuse_plugin_functionality__hr_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch represents the significant risk posed by YOURLS's plugin architecture. Plugins have deep integration with the core application, making vulnerabilities in this area particularly dangerous.

*   **1.1 Malicious Plugin [HR] [CN]**

    *   **Description:** An attacker installs a malicious plugin, either by compromising a legitimate plugin repository, social engineering an administrator, or exploiting a vulnerability that allows arbitrary plugin installation. This plugin contains code designed to compromise the YOURLS instance.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on admin diligence and plugin source security)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Potential for complete control of the YOURLS instance, data theft, redirection of all short URLs, etc.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Developing a malicious plugin requires coding skills, but distribution can be easier)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Plugin development, potentially exploit development, and social engineering)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires code review of the plugin, behavioral analysis, or intrusion detection systems)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (official YOURLS directory, reputable developers).
        *   **Plugin Code Review:** Manually inspect the plugin's source code before installation, if possible.
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing (Ideal, but complex):** Explore techniques to isolate plugins from the core YOURLS code, limiting the damage a malicious plugin can cause.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review installed plugins and their permissions.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure plugins only have the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Monitor Plugin Repositories:** Be aware of any reported vulnerabilities in plugins you are using.

*   **1.2 Authentication Bypass via Plugin [HR]**

    *   **Description:** A poorly written or intentionally malicious plugin contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass YOURLS's authentication mechanisms. This could involve exploiting flaws in how the plugin interacts with the YOURLS API, session management, or user authentication logic.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on the complexity and quality of installed plugins)
    *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to administrative functions, allowing modification of short URLs, user accounts, and settings)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding the plugin's code and identifying authentication-related vulnerabilities)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Vulnerability research and exploitation)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring for unusual API calls, unauthorized access attempts, or unexpected behavior)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Plugin Code Review:** Thoroughly review the authentication and authorization logic of all installed plugins.
        *   **Input Validation:** Ensure plugins properly validate all user inputs, especially those related to authentication or session management.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict plugin permissions to the absolute minimum required.
        *   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual API calls or authentication attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Configuration Issues [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_configuration_issues__hr_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch highlights vulnerabilities arising from improper configuration of the YOURLS instance. These are often easier to exploit than code-level vulnerabilities.

*   **3.1 Weak Cookie Secret [HR] [CN]**

    *   **Description:** YOURLS uses a `YOURLS_COOKIE_KEY` setting to sign cookies used for authentication. If this secret is weak (e.g., a default value, a short string, a common word, or easily guessable), an attacker can forge valid authentication cookies.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Administrators *should* set a strong secret, but mistakes happen, and default values might be used in testing or overlooked)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Forged cookies grant full administrative access to the YOURLS instance, allowing complete control)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (If the secret is weak or default, exploitation is trivial using readily available tools)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (Basic understanding of cookies and HTTP requests)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Requires access to the YOURLS configuration file or analyzing network traffic for patterns indicative of forged cookies, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the secret)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strong Secret Generation:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to create a long (at least 64 characters, preferably longer) and complex cookie secret. Avoid using words, phrases, or easily guessable patterns.
        *   **Secret Rotation:** Regularly rotate the cookie secret (e.g., every few months or after any suspected security incident).
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store the cookie secret securely, protecting it from unauthorized access.
        *   **Configuration Review:** Regularly review the YOURLS configuration file to ensure the secret is strong and hasn't been accidentally changed or exposed.
