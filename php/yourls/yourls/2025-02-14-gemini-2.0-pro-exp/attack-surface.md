# Attack Surface Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Attack Surface: [Spam/Phishing URL Generation](./attack_surfaces/spamphishing_url_generation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers abuse the URL shortening service to create links to malicious websites.
*   **How YOURLS Contributes:** Provides the core functionality for creating short URLs, which can mask the true destination.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a short URL pointing to `phishing-site.com/fake-login`, disguised as a legitimate service.
*   **Impact:** Users are tricked into visiting malicious sites, leading to credential theft, malware infection, or financial loss. YOURLS instance may be blacklisted.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement URL blacklisting (using external services like Google Safe Browsing), rate limiting (per IP and globally), CAPTCHAs, and consider requiring authentication for URL creation. Implement robust input validation.
    *   **Users:** If self-hosting, regularly update blacklists and monitor for abuse. Consider disabling public URL creation if not strictly necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Stored XSS (in Admin Interface)](./attack_surfaces/stored_xss__in_admin_interface_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into URL titles or descriptions, affecting other admins.
*   **How YOURLS Contributes:** The admin interface stores and displays user-provided data (URL titles, descriptions) without proper sanitization.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a short URL with a title containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which executes when another admin views the URL details.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of administrator accounts, potential for further attacks on the YOURLS instance or the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement rigorous output encoding (HTML entity encoding) and input validation. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script execution. Sanitize all user-provided input *before* storing it in the database.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about the content of URLs being shortened, especially if from untrusted sources (though this is primarily a developer responsibility).

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated admins into performing unintended actions.
*   **How YOURLS Contributes:** The admin interface allows modification and deletion of short URLs, and may lack sufficient CSRF protection.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by an authenticated admin, deletes all short URLs.
*   **Impact:** Loss of data, disruption of service, potential for unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement CSRF tokens for *all* state-changing actions (creating, editing, deleting URLs). Ensure these tokens are properly validated on the server-side.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about clicking links from untrusted sources while logged into the YOURLS admin interface (though this is primarily a developer responsibility).

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (in Admin Interface)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__in_admin_interface_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through search/filter fields.
*   **How YOURLS Contributes:** The admin interface interacts with the database to manage short URLs, and may have insufficient input validation.
*   **Example:** An attacker enters `' OR 1=1 --` into a search field, potentially bypassing authentication or retrieving all data.
*   **Impact:** Database compromise, data leakage, potential for complete control of the YOURLS instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* database interactions. Avoid dynamic SQL construction based on user input. Implement strict input validation.
    *   **Users:** No direct mitigation; this relies entirely on secure coding practices by the developers.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Leakage](./attack_surfaces/api_key_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of API keys allows unauthorized access to the YOURLS API.
*   **How YOURLS Contributes:** YOURLS provides an API for programmatic interaction, and relies on API keys for authentication.
*   **Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can create, modify, or delete short URLs, potentially causing significant disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Provide clear documentation on secure API key management.
    *   **Users:** Store API keys securely (e.g., in environment variables, a secure configuration file *outside* the webroot). Avoid embedding API keys in client-side code. Regularly rotate API keys. Use .gitignore or similar to prevent accidental commits.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party plugins introduce security vulnerabilities.
*   **How YOURLS Contributes:** YOURLS supports a plugin architecture.
*   **Example:** A poorly coded plugin allows arbitrary file uploads.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but can include complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the plugin)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide security guidelines for plugin developers.
        *   **Users:** Carefully vet plugins. Keep plugins updated. Audit installed plugins. Disable unused plugins.
