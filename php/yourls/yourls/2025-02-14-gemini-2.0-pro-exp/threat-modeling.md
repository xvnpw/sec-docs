# Threat Model Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Threat: [Unauthorized URL Modification/Deletion (Admin Panel)](./threats/unauthorized_url_modificationdeletion__admin_panel_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the YOURLS administrative interface, either through credential stuffing, session hijacking (relevant as it's the *intended* access method), or exploiting a vulnerability in the admin panel itself. Once logged in, they can modify or delete existing short URLs, redirecting users to malicious sites or breaking existing links.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of service, redirection of users to malicious websites, data loss (if URLs are deleted).
*   **Affected Component:** `admin/` directory (all administrative interface files), database interaction functions within the admin panel.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Consider adding support for 2FA natively. Regularly audit the admin panel code for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:** Use a strong, unique password for the YOURLS admin account. Enable 2FA if available (via a plugin). Restrict access to the `/admin/` directory to trusted IP addresses using `.htaccess` or server-level configuration. Regularly back up the YOURLS database.

## Threat: [Unauthorized URL Modification/Deletion (API)](./threats/unauthorized_url_modificationdeletion__api_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the YOURLS API secret signature (API key) and uses it to make unauthorized API calls. They can create, modify, or delete short URLs without needing to access the admin panel. Exposure could occur through insecure storage, accidental disclosure, or a compromised client application.
*   **Impact:** Similar to admin panel compromise: disruption of service, redirection to malicious sites, data loss.
*   **Affected Component:** `includes/functions-api.php` (API request handling), any functions that interact with the database based on API requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Provide clear documentation on secure API key management. Consider implementing API key rotation features.
    *   **Users:** Store the API secret signature securely (e.g., in a server-side configuration file, environment variable, or secrets management system). *Never* embed the API key in client-side code. Regularly rotate the API key. Implement rate limiting on API requests.

## Threat: [Short URL Prediction/Enumeration](./threats/short_url_predictionenumeration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess or sequentially generate valid short URLs. They might use a script to try common keywords, incrementing numbers, or combinations of characters. This allows them to discover shortened URLs that were intended to be private or unlisted.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources linked by private short URLs, potential redirection to malicious sites if the attacker can predict and register a URL before the legitimate user.
*   **Affected Component:** `includes/functions-shorturls.php` (specifically the URL generation logic), potentially custom keyword generation functions if implemented.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if sequential or easily guessable keywords are used).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Improve the default keyword generation algorithm to ensure high entropy and randomness. Offer configuration options for keyword length and complexity.
    *   **Users:** Always use strong, random, and sufficiently long custom keywords. Avoid sequential or predictable patterns. Enable and configure any available plugins that enhance URL randomness. Implement rate limiting on URL creation.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious plugin to the YOURLS installation, either through a compromised admin account or by exploiting a vulnerability in the plugin upload functionality *if provided by core YOURLS*. The malicious plugin can contain arbitrary code that compromises the entire YOURLS instance.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breaches, arbitrary code execution, potential lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** `includes/functions-plugins.php` (plugin loading and execution, *if upload is core functionality*), the entire `user/plugins/` directory.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation of uploaded plugin files *if upload is a core feature*. Consider a plugin signing mechanism to verify plugin integrity. Provide a curated list of trusted plugins.
    *   **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (official YOURLS plugin directory or reputable developers). Verify plugin checksums before installation. Regularly update plugins. Implement file integrity monitoring on the `user/plugins/` directory.
