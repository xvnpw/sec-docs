# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong, Unique Passwords & 2FA](./mitigation_strategies/strong__unique_passwords_&_2fa.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce strong passwords and require Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all administrative accounts.

**Description:**
1.  **Password Policy (config.php):** Modify the `config.php` file to set minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters), require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and potentially disallow common passwords using a blacklist.  This is done using YOURLS's built-in configuration options.
2.  **2FA Plugin Installation:** Install a 2FA plugin (e.g., a Google Authenticator plugin) from the YOURLS plugin directory. This utilizes YOURLS's plugin system.
3.  **2FA Configuration:** Configure the 2FA plugin, typically involving setting up a secret key and providing instructions for users to link their authenticator apps. This is done within the YOURLS admin interface.
4.  **2FA Enforcement:**  Make 2FA *mandatory* for all administrative accounts.  This usually involves a setting within the 2FA plugin or YOURLS core configuration, accessible through the admin panel.
5.  **User Education:**  Provide clear instructions to administrators on how to set up and use 2FA (though this is less about YOURLS itself).

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):**
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Severity: High):**
    *   **Unauthorized Account Access (Severity: High):**
    *   **Phishing (Severity: Medium):**

**Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced to near zero.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Unauthorized Account Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Phishing:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   `config.php` has a minimum password length of 8 characters and requires numbers.
    *   A Google Authenticator plugin is installed but *not* enforced.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   Password complexity requirements are not fully enforced.
    *   2FA is *optional*, not mandatory.
    *   No blacklist of common passwords.

## Mitigation Strategy: [IP Restriction (Whitelist)](./mitigation_strategies/ip_restriction__whitelist_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict access to the YOURLS admin panel to a specific set of allowed IP addresses.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Admin IPs:** Determine the static IP addresses (or ranges) from which administrators will access the YOURLS admin panel.
2.  **Configuration (config.php):** YOURLS allows specifying allowed IPs directly in the `config.php` file using the `YOURLS_ADMIN_IPS` constant. This is the *key* YOURLS-specific action.
3.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):**
    *   **Remote Exploits (Severity: Medium):**

**Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Remote Exploits:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   No IP restriction is currently in place.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `YOURLS_ADMIN_IPS` constant needs to be configured in `config.php`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Login Attempts](./mitigation_strategies/limit_login_attempts.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Limit the number of failed login attempts from a single IP address.

**Description:**
1.  **Plugin or Core Functionality:** Utilize either YOURLS's built-in rate limiting (if available) or install a YOURLS plugin that provides this functionality. This relies on YOURLS's plugin system or core features.
2.  **Configuration:** Configure the rate limiting settings *within YOURLS* (either through the plugin's settings page or YOURLS's own configuration options).

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):**

**Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   A basic rate-limiting plugin is installed, limiting to 10 attempts per hour.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   The lockout period and threshold could be adjusted within the plugin's settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change Default Admin Path](./mitigation_strategies/change_default_admin_path.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Change the default `/admin` path to a less predictable URL.

**Description:**
1.  **config.php Modification:** Edit the `config.php` file and change the `YOURLS_ADMIN_FOLDER` constant to a new, non-obvious path. This is a direct YOURLS configuration change.
2.  **Testing:** Access the admin panel using the new path.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Automated Scanners (Severity: Low):**
    *   **Opportunistic Attackers (Severity: Low):**

**Impact:**
    *   **Automated Scanners & Opportunistic Attackers:** Provides a small degree of protection.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   The default `/admin` path is still in use.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `YOURLS_ADMIN_FOLDER` constant needs to be changed in `config.php`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation & Sanitization (XSS)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_&_sanitization__xss_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Rigorously validate and sanitize all user input, both in the YOURLS core and in any installed plugins.

**Description:**
1.  **Plugin Review:** Carefully review the code of all third-party *YOURLS plugins* before installation. This focuses on the YOURLS plugin ecosystem.
2.  **Custom Code (If Applicable):** If you develop custom *YOURLS plugins* or modifications, implement strict input validation and sanitization within the plugin's PHP code. This is specific to extending YOURLS.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):**

**Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
    *   YOURLS core appears to have good practices.
    *   One installed plugin has questionable input handling.

**Missing Implementation:**
    *   The problematic plugin needs review/modification/replacement.
