## Attack Tree Path: [Create Malicious Short URLs (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/create_malicious_short_urls__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Phishing Attacks (HIGH RISK):** Attackers create short URLs that redirect to fake login pages mimicking the target application. Users trusting the shortened link might enter their credentials, leading to account compromise.
    * **Redirect to Fake Login Pages (AND Application Domain Spoofing) (HIGH RISK):** The short URL leads to a fraudulent page designed to steal user credentials. Domain spoofing can make the fake page appear more legitimate.
* **Malware Distribution (HIGH RISK):** Short URLs redirect to websites hosting malware or exploit kits. Unsuspecting users clicking these links can have their devices infected.
    * **Redirect to Sites Hosting Exploits/Malware (HIGH RISK):** The shortened link directly leads to a site that attempts to install malicious software on the user's device.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Yourls Admin Interface (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_yourls_admin_interface__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Brute-Force Admin Credentials (HIGH RISK):** Attackers attempt to guess the admin username and password through repeated login attempts.
* **Exploit Default Admin Credentials (if not changed) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK):** If the default admin credentials are not changed, attackers can easily gain access.
* **Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):** Vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism could allow attackers to bypass login requirements.
* **SQL Injection in Admin Interface (if database interaction exists) (CRITICAL NODE):** If the admin interface interacts with a database without proper input sanitization, attackers could inject SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to data or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (if yourls uses a database) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__if_yourls_uses_a_database___critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Modify Existing Mappings (HIGH RISK):** Redirect legitimate short URLs to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal to Access Configuration Files (CRITICAL NODE POTENTIAL)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_to_access_configuration_files__critical_node_potential_.md)

* **Retrieve Sensitive Information (API Keys, Database Credentials) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK):** Accessing configuration files can expose critical secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data (CRITICAL NODE POTENTIAL)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data__critical_node_potential_.md)

* **Retrieve API Keys or other secrets (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK):**  Direct access to sensitive credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Yourls Plugins (CRITICAL NODE POTENTIAL, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_yourls_plugins__critical_node_potential__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Plugins (HIGH RISK):** Attackers identify installed plugins and exploit known vulnerabilities.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK):** Vulnerable plugins could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Data Breach via Plugin Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE):** Plugin vulnerabilities could expose sensitive data stored by the plugin or the core yourls application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Yourls (CRITICAL NODE POTENTIAL)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_yourls__critical_node_potential_.md)

* **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (HIGH RISK):** Attackers identify the libraries and components used by yourls and exploit known vulnerabilities.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Dependency Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK):** Vulnerabilities in dependencies could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
