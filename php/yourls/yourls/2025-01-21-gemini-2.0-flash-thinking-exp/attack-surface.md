# Attack Surface Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Attack Surface: [Admin Interface Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/admin_interface_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** A flaw in the authentication mechanism allows unauthorized access to the administrative dashboard.

**How YOURLS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** YOURLS provides a dedicated admin interface for managing links and settings. Weaknesses in its authentication logic directly expose this interface.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the session management allows an attacker to predict or hijack a valid administrator session cookie without needing valid credentials.

**Impact:** Full control over the YOURLS instance, including the ability to create malicious short links, delete legitimate ones, modify settings, and potentially gain further access to the underlying server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust and secure authentication mechanisms, including strong password hashing, secure session management (using HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies), and protection against common authentication bypass techniques. Regularly review and update authentication code. Enforce strong password policies. Consider multi-factor authentication.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** Malicious scripts can be injected into input fields within the admin interface and executed in the browsers of other administrators.

**How YOURLS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** YOURLS allows administrators to input data like custom short URLs, titles, and descriptions. If this input is not properly sanitized, it can be used to inject scripts.

**Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Title" field of a short URL. When another administrator views the list of URLs, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account takeover of administrators, defacement of the admin interface, or redirection of administrators to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all data displayed in the admin interface. Use context-aware escaping techniques. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** The core functionality of YOURLS, redirecting short URLs, can be abused to redirect users to arbitrary external websites.

**How YOURLS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** YOURLS's primary function is URL redirection. If the destination URL is not properly validated, attackers can manipulate the redirection target.

**Example:** An attacker creates a short URL that redirects to a phishing website designed to steal user credentials. Unsuspecting users clicking on the short link are redirected to the malicious site.

**Impact:** Phishing attacks, malware distribution, and damage to the reputation of the YOURLS instance owner.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strict whitelisting of allowed URL schemes (e.g., `http://`, `https://`) and domains if possible. Sanitize and validate the destination URL before redirection. Consider displaying a warning page before redirecting to external sites.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into database queries through user-supplied input.

**How YOURLS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** YOURLS interacts with a database to store short URLs and other data. If input used in database queries is not properly sanitized, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious short URL containing SQL code that, when processed by YOURLS, allows them to extract sensitive data from the database or even execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and potentially complete compromise of the YOURLS installation and the underlying database server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. This prevents user input from being directly interpreted as SQL code. Implement proper input validation and sanitization on the server-side.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__in_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** Attackers can trick authenticated administrators into performing unintended actions on the YOURLS instance.

**How YOURLS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The admin interface allows for actions like creating, deleting, and modifying short URLs and settings. If these actions are not protected against CSRF, they can be triggered by malicious websites or emails.

**Example:** An attacker sends an email to an administrator with a link that, when clicked while the administrator is logged into YOURLS, silently deletes all short URLs.

**Impact:** Unintended modification or deletion of data, changes to YOURLS settings, and potentially further compromise of the system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement CSRF protection mechanisms, such as synchronizer tokens (CSRF tokens) in forms and AJAX requests. Ensure that all state-changing requests require a valid CSRF token.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Plugin Management (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_plugin_management__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the way plugins are installed, updated, or managed can introduce security risks.

**How YOURLS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** YOURLS supports plugins to extend its functionality. If the plugin system is not secure, it can be a point of entry for attackers.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the plugin installation process to upload a malicious plugin that grants them backdoor access to the server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the YOURLS instance and potentially the underlying server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement secure plugin installation and update mechanisms. Verify the integrity and authenticity of plugins. Isolate plugins to limit the impact of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Configuration File (`config.php`)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_configuration_file___config_php__.md)

**Description:** The `config.php` file, containing sensitive information like database credentials, is accessible to unauthorized users.

**How YOURLS Contributes to the Attack Surface:** YOURLS stores critical configuration details in `config.php`. Improper web server configuration can expose this file.

**Example:** Due to misconfigured web server rules, an attacker can directly access `config.php` by navigating to its URL, revealing database credentials.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the YOURLS instance and potentially other systems using the same database credentials.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Provide clear instructions on securing the `config.php` file during installation and deployment.
