# Threat Model Analysis for yourls/yourls

## Threat: [Open Redirection Vulnerability via yourls redirection script](./threats/open_redirection_vulnerability_via_yourls_redirection_script.md)

Description: While yourls is designed for redirection, vulnerabilities in how it handles the redirection logic could be exploited. An attacker might craft a request that bypasses the intended short URL lookup and redirects users to an arbitrary external site. This could involve manipulating parameters or exploiting flaws in the redirection script.

Impact: Phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious login pages or fake websites, malware distribution, bypassing security controls that rely on the yourls domain.

Affected Component: The core redirection script, typically `yourls-go.php`.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
- Ensure the redirection script strictly validates the provided short URL against the stored database entries.
- Avoid any logic that could lead to uncontrolled redirects based on user-supplied input other than the expected short URL identifier.
- Regularly review and audit the redirection code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Default or Weak Administrative Credentials](./threats/default_or_weak_administrative_credentials.md)

Description: If the default administrative username and password are not changed during installation or if weak credentials are used, attackers can easily gain access to the yourls administration panel through brute-force attacks or by using known default credentials.

Impact: Full control over the yourls instance, including the ability to create, modify, and delete short URLs, potentially redirecting all users to malicious sites or deleting legitimate links, accessing sensitive data within the yourls database.

Affected Component: Authentication mechanism within the admin interface (`/admin/index.php` and related authentication files).

Risk Severity: Critical

Mitigation Strategies:
- Enforce strong password policies for administrative accounts.
- Require users to change the default administrative credentials upon initial setup.
- Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.
- Consider using multi-factor authentication for administrative access.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

Description: If the `config.php` file is not properly secured with appropriate file permissions, attackers who gain access to the server (e.g., through other vulnerabilities) could read this file and obtain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys (if used), and salts.

Impact: Database compromise, unauthorized access to the yourls instance, potential for wider system compromise if database credentials are reused.

Affected Component: The `config.php` file.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
- Ensure proper file permissions on `config.php`, restricting access to the web server user only.
- Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files if possible (consider using environment variables).
