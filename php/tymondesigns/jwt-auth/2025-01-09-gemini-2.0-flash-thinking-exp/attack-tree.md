## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via JWT-Auth Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_jwt-auth_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the successful culmination of any of the attacks listed below. The attacker gains unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting weaknesses in the JWT authentication mechanism.
* **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, potential data breach, loss of user trust, financial damage, reputational harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in JWT Generation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_jwt_generation__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker focuses on flaws in how the application creates JWTs, aiming to generate valid or seemingly valid tokens without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Secret Key (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_secret_key__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses a secret key that is easily guessable, a default value, or has been compromised. The attacker can use this key to sign their own malicious JWTs, impersonating legitimate users or gaining administrative privileges.
* **Impact:** Complete authentication bypass, full control over user accounts and application resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Key Storage (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_key_storage__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The JWT secret key is stored in a location where an attacker can access it, such as in publicly accessible configuration files, within the codebase, or in version control systems. Once the key is obtained, the attacker can forge JWTs.
* **Impact:**  Similar to a weak secret key, leading to authentication bypass and full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Algorithm Confusion Attack (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/algorithm_confusion_attack__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application doesn't enforce the expected signing algorithm during JWT generation and verification. An attacker crafts a JWT with the "none" algorithm (or another insecure algorithm allowed by the application), effectively bypassing signature verification.
* **Impact:** Allows the attacker to create arbitrary valid-looking JWTs without knowing the secret key, leading to authentication bypass and unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in JWT Verification (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_jwt_verification__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker targets flaws in how the application validates the received JWTs, seeking to have forged or manipulated tokens accepted as legitimate.

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing or Improper Signature Verification (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/missing_or_improper_signature_verification__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application fails to correctly verify the signature of the JWT. This could be due to incorrect implementation of the verification logic or disabling signature verification altogether. The attacker can then modify the JWT claims without invalidating the signature (or with no signature at all).
* **Impact:** Allows the attacker to manipulate user roles, permissions, and other critical claims within the JWT, leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Information Exposure via JWT (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_information_exposure_via_jwt__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Even if the authentication is secure, the attacker exploits the fact that JWTs are base64 encoded and can be easily decoded to reveal the information within the claims.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sensitive Information in JWT Claims (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/sensitive_information_in_jwt_claims__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application includes sensitive information (e.g., user roles, permissions, personal data) directly in the JWT payload. An attacker intercepting the token can easily decode it and access this information.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential for identity theft, unauthorized access to resources based on revealed roles or permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Token Handling Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_token_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker focuses on how the application stores and manages JWTs on the client-side, aiming to steal or manipulate these tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Leading to Token Theft (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__leading_to_token_theft__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's frontend. This script can then access the user's cookies or local storage where the JWT is stored and send it to the attacker's server.
* **Impact:** Complete account takeover. The attacker can use the stolen JWT to impersonate the user and perform any actions they are authorized to do.
