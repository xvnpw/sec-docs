# Threat Model Analysis for tymondesigns/jwt-auth

## Threat: [Weak Secret Key](./threats/weak_secret_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak Secret Key
    *   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to guess or brute-force the secret key used by `jwt-auth` to sign JWTs. If successful, they can forge valid JWTs for any user by using the compromised key with `jwt-auth`'s signing functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Complete authentication bypass, unauthorized access to all user accounts and resources, potential data breaches, and the ability to perform actions as any user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWT::signingKey()` method within `jwt-auth` and the configuration mechanism used to store the secret key accessed by this component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, randomly generated, high-entropy secrets.
        *   Store the secret key securely, avoiding hardcoding in the codebase. Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management systems.
        *   Implement regular secret key rotation.

## Threat: [Exposed Secret Key](./threats/exposed_secret_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposed Secret Key
    *   **Description:** The secret key used by `jwt-auth` for signing JWTs is unintentionally exposed through various means, such as:
        *   Hardcoding in the codebase and committing to a public repository.
        *   Storing the key in insecure configuration files that are accessible.
        *   Leaking the key through server vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that allow access to the server's filesystem or environment variables.
        An attacker obtaining this key can use `jwt-auth`'s signing functions to forge valid JWTs.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to a weak secret key, attackers can forge valid JWTs, leading to complete authentication bypass and the ability to impersonate any user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading mechanisms used by `jwt-auth`, server security practices impacting access to the secret.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode the secret key in the application code.
        *   Utilize secure environment variables or dedicated secret management services that `jwt-auth` can access.
        *   Implement proper access controls and permissions for configuration files.
        *   Regularly scan codebase and infrastructure for exposed secrets.

## Threat: [Algorithm Confusion/Substitution Attack](./threats/algorithm_confusionsubstitution_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Algorithm Confusion/Substitution Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to manipulate the `alg` header of the JWT to use a weaker or no signature algorithm (e.g., `alg: none`). If the application, through its configuration or usage of `jwt-auth`, doesn't strictly enforce the expected algorithm, the attacker can forge JWTs without a valid signature, effectively bypassing `jwt-auth`'s verification.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** JWT verification logic within `JWT::check()` or related methods in `jwt-auth`, and the configuration controlling allowed algorithms within the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure and enforce the use of strong, approved signing algorithms (e.g., `HS256`, `RS256`) within the `jwt-auth` configuration.
        *   Ensure the application's JWT verification process, utilizing `jwt-auth`, strictly validates the `alg` header and rejects tokens with unexpected or insecure algorithms.
        *   Verify that `jwt-auth` is configured to prevent the use of `alg: none`.

## Threat: [Insufficient Claim Validation](./threats/insufficient_claim_validation.md)

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Claim Validation
    *   **Description:** The application, after `jwt-auth` successfully verifies the token's signature, doesn't properly validate the claims within the JWT (e.g., `exp`, `nbf`, custom roles/permissions). An attacker might manipulate these claims and, if not validated by the application logic interacting with `jwt-auth`'s output, bypass authorization checks or access resources they shouldn't.
    *   **Impact:** Authorization bypass, privilege escalation, access to sensitive data or functionalities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Application logic that consumes the validated JWT claims provided by `jwt-auth` after successful verification. While `jwt-auth` verifies the signature, it's the application's responsibility to validate the claims.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always validate the standard claims like `exp` (expiration time) and `nbf` (not before time) after `jwt-auth` verification.
        *   Thoroughly validate any custom claims used for authorization decisions based on the data extracted from the JWT by the application after `jwt-auth` processing.
        *   Ensure claim values are within expected ranges and formats in the application logic.

## Threat: [Exploiting Token Refresh Mechanisms (If Implemented Using `jwt-auth`)](./threats/exploiting_token_refresh_mechanisms__if_implemented_using__jwt-auth__.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Token Refresh Mechanisms (If Implemented Using `jwt-auth`)
    *   **Description:** If the application uses `jwt-auth` (or its ecosystem libraries) to implement token refresh mechanisms and this mechanism is flawed (e.g., refresh tokens are not securely stored, lack proper validation within `jwt-auth` or the application logic, or can be reused indefinitely), attackers might exploit it to gain persistent access.
    *   **Impact:** Long-term unauthorized access to user accounts, even after the initial session should have expired.
    *   **Affected Component:** The logic responsible for issuing and validating refresh tokens, potentially involving `jwt-auth`'s token generation and verification functionalities if used for refresh tokens.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store refresh tokens securely (e.g., in a database with proper encryption) if the application manages them.
        *   Implement proper validation for refresh tokens, ensuring they are associated with the correct user and haven't been used before, potentially leveraging `jwt-auth`'s validation capabilities.
        *   Use short expiration times for refresh tokens and implement rotation mechanisms.
