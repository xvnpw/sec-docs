By storing the secret key in accessible locations, developers create a significant risk of authentication bypass and full control for attackers. It is crucial to prioritize secure key management practices, primarily utilizing environment variables and avoiding hardcoding secrets. Regular security assessments and developer training are essential to prevent this high-risk vulnerability.")
