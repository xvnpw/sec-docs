# Attack Surface Analysis for tymondesigns/jwt-auth

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Exposed JWT Secret Key](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_exposed_jwt_secret_key.md)

**Description:** The secret key used to sign and verify JWTs is either easily guessable, hardcoded, or exposed through insecure storage or configuration.

**How jwt-auth Contributes:** `jwt-auth` relies on the `JWT_SECRET` configuration variable for cryptographic operations. If this secret is weak or exposed, the security of the entire JWT scheme managed by `jwt-auth` is compromised.

**Example:** The `.env` file containing `JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey` is accidentally committed to a public repository. An attacker finds this key, which allows them to forge valid JWTs that `jwt-auth` will accept.

**Impact:** Attackers can forge valid JWTs, impersonate users managed by the `jwt-auth` system, gain unauthorized access to resources protected by `jwt-auth`, and potentially escalate privileges within the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, randomly generated secrets with sufficient entropy for the `JWT_SECRET`.
* Securely store the `JWT_SECRET` using environment variables or a dedicated secret management system, ensuring it's not directly in the codebase.
* Avoid hardcoding the secret directly in the application's configuration files.
* Implement regular key rotation for the `JWT_SECRET`.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure JWT Algorithm Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_jwt_algorithm_configuration.md)

**Description:** The application is configured to use insecure or deprecated JWT signing algorithms (e.g., `none`).

**How jwt-auth Contributes:** `jwt-auth` allows configuring the algorithm used for JWT signing through the `jwt.php` configuration file. If set to an insecure algorithm, `jwt-auth` will use this weak method, weakening the security.

**Example:** The `jwt.php` configuration has `'algo' => 'none'`. This allows attackers to create JWTs with an empty signature, which `jwt-auth` will incorrectly validate as legitimate.

**Impact:** Attackers can forge JWTs without needing the secret key, leading to complete authentication bypass within the `jwt-auth` managed sections of the application and unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always configure `jwt-auth` to use strong and recommended algorithms like RS256 or ES256.
* Explicitly disallow insecure algorithms in the `jwt.php` configuration.
* Regularly review and update the application's dependencies, including `jwt-auth`, to benefit from security updates and best practices regarding algorithm choices.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of JWT Expiration (`exp`) Claim](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_jwt_expiration___exp___claim.md)

**Description:** The application, through its configuration or usage of `jwt-auth`, fails to properly validate the `exp` (expiration time) claim of the JWT, allowing expired tokens to be used for authentication.

**How jwt-auth Contributes:** While `jwt-auth` provides mechanisms for handling the `exp` claim, developers need to ensure it's correctly configured within the `jwt-auth` middleware or authentication guard to enforce expiration. Incorrect configuration bypasses this protection offered by `jwt-auth`.

**Example:** The `jwt-auth` middleware is not configured to check the `exp` claim, or a custom authentication guard built on `jwt-auth` omits this validation. An expired JWT is then accepted by the application.

**Impact:** Attackers can potentially reuse compromised or leaked JWTs even after they should have expired, extending the window of opportunity for malicious activity within the `jwt-auth` protected areas.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the `jwt-auth` middleware or any custom authentication guard utilizing `jwt-auth` is configured to strictly validate the `exp` claim.
* Set appropriate and reasonably short expiration times for JWTs generated by `jwt-auth`.
* Implement mechanisms for refreshing tokens if longer session durations are required, ensuring the refresh process is also secure.
