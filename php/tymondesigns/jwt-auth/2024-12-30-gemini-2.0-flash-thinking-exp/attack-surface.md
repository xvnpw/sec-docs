*   **Attack Surface: Weak or Predictable `JWT_SECRET`**
    *   **Description:** The secret key used to sign JWTs is weak, easily guessable, or has low entropy.
    *   **How jwt-auth Contributes:** `jwt-auth` relies on the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable for signing. If this variable is not securely generated and managed, it becomes a point of vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** The `JWT_SECRET` is set to a default value like "secret" or a common phrase, or it's a short, easily brute-forced string.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can forge valid JWTs, impersonate users, bypass authentication, and gain unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate a strong, cryptographically random `JWT_SECRET` with sufficient length and complexity.
        *   Store the `JWT_SECRET` securely, preferably using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
        *   Regularly rotate the `JWT_SECRET` as a security best practice.

*   **Attack Surface: Algorithm Confusion/Substitution Attacks**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit the lack of strict algorithm enforcement during JWT verification to use a weaker or different algorithm than intended.
    *   **How jwt-auth Contributes:** If `jwt-auth`'s configuration or the underlying JWT library doesn't strictly enforce the expected signing algorithm, attackers might try to use the `none` algorithm or a less secure HMAC variant.
    *   **Example:** An attacker changes the `alg` header in a JWT to "none" or a weaker algorithm and attempts to bypass signature verification.
    *   **Impact:** Successful bypass of signature verification, allowing attackers to forge JWTs and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure `jwt-auth` to use only strong, approved algorithms (e.g., `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512` for HMAC, or appropriate RS/ES algorithms).
        *   Ensure the underlying JWT library used by `jwt-auth` is configured to strictly enforce the expected algorithm during verification.
        *   Avoid allowing the `none` algorithm unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

*   **Attack Surface: Exposure of `JWT_SECRET`**
    *   **Description:** The `JWT_SECRET` is unintentionally exposed through various means.
    *   **How jwt-auth Contributes:** `jwt-auth`'s reliance on the `JWT_SECRET` makes its secure storage paramount. Any exposure directly compromises the authentication mechanism.
    *   **Example:** The `JWT_SECRET` is hardcoded in the application code, committed to version control, present in error logs, or accessible through server misconfigurations.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the JWT authentication system, allowing attackers to forge tokens and gain full access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode the `JWT_SECRET` in the application code.
        *   Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions to store the `JWT_SECRET`.
        *   Implement proper access controls and permissions on configuration files and environment settings.
        *   Regularly scan for exposed secrets in code repositories and logs.
