*   **Threat:** Weak or Predictable Signing Key
    *   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to guess or brute-force the secret key used to sign JWTs. If successful, they can forge valid JWTs.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to impersonate any user, gain unauthorized access to resources, and potentially manipulate data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWTAuth` facade (used for generating tokens), underlying JWT encoding/decoding logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, randomly generated secret keys with sufficient length and complexity.
        *   Store the secret key securely, preferably in environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
        *   Rotate the signing key periodically.

*   **Threat:** Algorithm Confusion Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate the JWT header to change the signing algorithm to a weaker or "none" algorithm, bypassing signature verification.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to create unsigned or weakly signed JWTs that the application might incorrectly trust, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWT::decode()` method (responsible for verifying the signature), middleware responsible for JWT authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the library is configured to explicitly enforce a specific, strong signing algorithm.
        *   Do not allow the client to specify or influence the signing algorithm used for verification.
        *   Regularly update the `jwt-auth` library to benefit from security patches.

*   **Threat:** Ignoring or Improperly Validating `exp` (Expiration) Claim
    *   **Description:** The application fails to properly check the `exp` claim in the JWT, allowing expired tokens to be used for authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to reuse old, potentially compromised JWTs to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWT::check()` method, middleware responsible for JWT authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `jwt-auth` library is configured to strictly enforce the `exp` claim. This is generally the default behavior, but verify the configuration.
        *   Set appropriate expiration times for JWTs based on security requirements.

*   **Threat:** Lack of JWT Revocation Mechanism
    *   **Description:** Once a JWT is issued, it remains valid until its expiration time. If a user's account is compromised or they log out, the existing JWTs might still be usable.
    *   **Impact:** Prolonged unauthorized access even after a security incident or user logout.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWTAuth` facade (for blacklisting), potentially custom logic for handling revocation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a JWT revocation mechanism (e.g., using the built-in blacklist feature of `jwt-auth`).
        *   Consider using refresh tokens with short lifespans to reduce the window of opportunity for compromised tokens.
