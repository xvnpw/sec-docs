# Threat Model Analysis for tymondesigns/jwt-auth

## Threat: [Weak Secret Key](./threats/weak_secret_key.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak Secret Key
    *   **Description:** If the `jwt-auth` library is configured with a weak or easily guessable secret key, an attacker can exploit this to forge valid JWTs using the same weak key. This allows them to impersonate any user.
    *   **Impact:** Complete account takeover, unauthorized access to all resources, ability to perform actions as any user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWTManager` (configuration setting for `secret`), `JWT::encode()` function (uses the secret for signing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate a cryptographically strong, random secret key with sufficient length and complexity.
        *   Configure the `jwt-auth` library to use this strong secret key.
        *   Store the secret securely, using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system, and avoid hardcoding it in the application.
        *   Regularly rotate the secret key.

## Threat: [Algorithm Confusion Vulnerability](./threats/algorithm_confusion_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Algorithm Confusion Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** If the `jwt-auth` library's configuration or the application logic does not strictly enforce the allowed signing algorithms, an attacker can manipulate the JWT header to use the "none" algorithm or a weak/deprecated algorithm. This bypasses the signature verification process within the `jwt-auth` library.
    *   **Impact:** Bypass authentication entirely, impersonate any user without needing the secret key, gain unauthorized access to protected resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWTManager` (configuration setting for `algo`), `JWT::decode()` function (performs signature verification based on the algorithm).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure the `jwt-auth` library to only allow strong and secure signing algorithms (e.g., HS256, RS256).
        *   Ensure the configuration disallows the "none" algorithm.
        *   Regularly update the `jwt-auth` library to benefit from security patches that might address algorithm handling.

## Threat: [JWT Secret Exposure Leading to Forgery](./threats/jwt_secret_exposure_leading_to_forgery.md)

*   **Threat:** JWT Secret Exposure Leading to Forgery
    *   **Description:** If the secret key used by `jwt-auth` is exposed (e.g., through misconfigured servers, insecure storage, or vulnerabilities in other parts of the application), an attacker can obtain this secret and use it to forge valid JWTs.
    *   **Impact:** Complete account takeover, unauthorized access to all resources, ability to perform actions as any user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWTManager` (the secret itself), any part of the application or infrastructure where the secret is stored or accessed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the JWT secret securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
        *   Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to configuration files and environment variables.
        *   Regularly audit the application and infrastructure for potential secret leaks.

## Threat: [Failure to Validate `exp` (Expiration Time) Claim](./threats/failure_to_validate__exp___expiration_time__claim.md)

*   **Threat:** Failure to Validate `exp` (Expiration Time) Claim
    *   **Description:** If the `jwt-auth` library is not configured correctly or if there's a flaw in its implementation, it might fail to properly validate the `exp` (expiration time) claim of a JWT. This allows attackers to reuse expired JWTs to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access using old, potentially compromised JWTs, even after a user's session should have expired.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JWT::check()` function, `JWT::parseToken()` function (specifically the logic for checking the `exp` claim).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `jwt-auth` library is configured to strictly enforce the `exp` claim. This is generally the default behavior, but verify the configuration.
        *   Set appropriate and relatively short expiration times for JWTs to minimize the window of opportunity for using compromised tokens.
        *   Regularly update the `jwt-auth` library to benefit from any bug fixes related to claim validation.
