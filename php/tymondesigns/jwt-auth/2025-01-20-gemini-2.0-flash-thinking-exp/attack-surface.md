# Attack Surface Analysis for tymondesigns/jwt-auth

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default JWT Secret Key](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_jwt_secret_key.md)

**Description:** The application uses a weak, easily guessable, or the default secret key for signing JWTs.

**How `jwt-auth` Contributes:** `jwt-auth` relies on the developer to configure a strong secret key. If a weak key is provided in the configuration (e.g., `.env` file), the library will use it, creating a vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker discovers the default secret key used in many `jwt-auth` examples or a weak secret like "secret" configured in the application's `.env` file. They can then forge valid JWTs.

**Impact:** Critical. Attackers can forge JWTs, impersonate any user, bypass authentication, and potentially gain full control of the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Generate Strong, Unique Secrets:** Use cryptographically secure random strings for the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable.
* **Securely Store Secrets:**  Store the secret key securely, preferably using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system. Avoid hardcoding secrets in the application code.
* **Regularly Rotate Secrets:** Periodically change the `JWT_SECRET` to limit the lifespan of potentially compromised keys.

## Attack Surface: [JWT Algorithm Confusion](./attack_surfaces/jwt_algorithm_confusion.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate the `alg` header of the JWT to bypass signature verification or downgrade to a weaker, exploitable algorithm.

**How `jwt-auth` Contributes:** If `jwt-auth`'s configuration doesn't strictly enforce the expected signing algorithm or if the verification process is not robust, it might be susceptible to algorithm confusion attacks.

**Example:** An attacker changes the `alg` header from `HS256` (HMAC with SHA-256) to `none` or `HS256` with a null key, and the application incorrectly validates the token.

**Impact:** High. Attackers can forge JWTs without knowing the secret key, leading to authentication bypass and potential privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Explicitly Define and Enforce Allowed Algorithms:** Configure `jwt-auth` to only accept specific, strong signing algorithms (e.g., `HS256`, `RS256`).
* **Strict Algorithm Validation:** Ensure the JWT verification process strictly adheres to the configured algorithm and rejects tokens with unexpected or insecure algorithms.
* **Avoid Using `none` Algorithm:** Never allow the `none` algorithm for JWT signing.

## Attack Surface: [Ignoring JWT Expiration (`exp` Claim)](./attack_surfaces/ignoring_jwt_expiration___exp__claim_.md)

**Description:** The application doesn't properly validate the `exp` (expiration time) claim in the JWT.

**How `jwt-auth` Contributes:** While `jwt-auth` provides functionality to check the `exp` claim, developers must explicitly enable and utilize this validation. If not implemented correctly, expired tokens will be accepted.

**Example:** An attacker obtains a valid JWT. Even after its intended expiration time, the application continues to accept it, allowing continued unauthorized access.

**Impact:** High. Attackers can reuse compromised or leaked tokens for an extended period, even after they should have expired.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable and Enforce `exp` Validation:** Ensure that `jwt-auth`'s configuration or middleware is set up to validate the `exp` claim.
* **Set Appropriate Token Expiration Times:** Configure reasonable token expiration times (TTL) based on the application's security requirements. Shorter expiration times reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.
