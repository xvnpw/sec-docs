# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project aims to implement secure authentication and authorization for web applications and APIs using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The primary business goal is to protect sensitive resources and data by ensuring only authenticated and authorized users or applications can access them. This is crucial for maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and for complying with relevant security and privacy regulations.

Business priorities for this project are:
- Security: Robust and reliable authentication and authorization mechanisms are paramount to protect business assets and user data.
- Ease of Integration: The solution should be relatively easy to integrate into existing and new applications without significant development overhead.
- Performance: Authentication and authorization processes should be efficient and not introduce noticeable latency for users.
- Scalability: The solution should be able to handle increasing user loads and application growth.

Key business risks associated with this project include:
- Authentication Bypass: Unauthorized access to resources due to vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism.
- Data Breaches: Exposure of sensitive data due to compromised authentication or authorization.
- Service Disruption: Denial of service or performance degradation due to authentication system failures or attacks.
- Compliance Violations: Failure to meet regulatory requirements related to data protection and access control.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Secure coding practices are assumed to be followed during the development of the JWT Auth package (as a third-party library). Location: Implicit in the development process of the library.
- security control: HTTPS is assumed to be used for all communication between clients and the application/API. Location: Infrastructure level, web server configuration.
- security control: Input validation is expected to be implemented within the application using the JWT Auth package to handle user credentials and JWT claims. Location: Application code using the JWT Auth package.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies of the JWT Auth package. Mitigation: Dependency scanning and updates.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of the JWT Auth package or the application using it. Mitigation: Secure configuration guidelines and testing.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement dependency scanning for the JWT Auth package and its dependencies to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) on the application code that integrates with the JWT Auth package to identify potential security flaws.
- security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) on the deployed application to identify runtime security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and throttling on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
- security control: Implement security logging and monitoring for authentication and authorization events to detect and respond to security incidents.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Securely authenticate users or applications attempting to access protected resources.
    - requirement: Support password-based authentication and potentially other authentication methods (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
    - requirement: Implement protection against brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Enforce authorization policies to ensure that only authorized users or applications can access specific resources or perform certain actions.
    - requirement: Utilize JWT claims to represent user roles and permissions for fine-grained access control.
    - requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) as needed.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Validate all inputs related to authentication and authorization, including user credentials, JWTs, and API requests.
    - requirement: Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    - requirement: Implement proper error handling and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms for JWT signing and encryption (if applicable).
    - requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys used for JWT signing and encryption.
    - requirement: Enforce HTTPS for all communication involving sensitive data, including JWT transmission.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- User Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or applications accessing the system. Failure can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
- API Access Control: Ensuring that only authorized users or applications can access specific API endpoints and resources. Failure can lead to data breaches and unauthorized actions.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User Credentials (passwords): Highly sensitive. If compromised, attackers can impersonate users and gain unauthorized access.
- User Roles and Permissions: Sensitive. Incorrect authorization can lead to unauthorized access to data and functionality.
- Application Data: Sensitivity depends on the specific application. Could range from low to high sensitivity depending on the nature of the data (e.g., personal data, financial data, confidential business information).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the specific use case for JWT authentication? (e.g., API security, web application session management, microservices authentication).
- What are the expected user volumes and transaction rates? (To inform scalability and performance considerations).
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
- What is the organization's risk appetite? (To prioritize security controls).
- Are there any existing identity providers or authentication systems that need to be integrated with?
- What is the expected lifespan of the application and the JWT Auth integration? (To plan for long-term maintenance and security updates).

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The project is critical for securing access to valuable resources and data. Security is a high priority. The organization has a moderate risk appetite and is willing to invest in reasonable security controls.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Standard web security practices are currently in place (HTTPS, basic input validation). There is a need to enhance security controls, particularly around dependency management, SAST/DAST, and rate limiting. Secure software development lifecycle principles are generally followed but can be strengthened.
- DESIGN: A typical three-tier web application architecture is assumed (Web Server, Application Server, Database Server). Cloud-based deployment on AWS is considered as a likely scenario. GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD. The JWT Auth package is used as a core component for authentication and authorization.
