# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tymondesigns/jwt-auth

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Strong JWT Secret Key Generation (in JWT-Auth Context)](./mitigation_strategies/1__strong_jwt_secret_key_generation__in_jwt-auth_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong JWT Secret Key Generation (in JWT-Auth Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use a cryptographically secure random number generator:** Utilize functions like `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes` in PHP or similar functions to generate a truly random string for the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth`.
    2.  **Ensure sufficient length and complexity:** The `JWT_SECRET` should be long (at least 32 characters for HS256, longer for stronger algorithms) and contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    3.  **Avoid predictable patterns or dictionary words:** The `JWT_SECRET` should be completely random and not based on any easily guessable patterns or words. This secret is directly used by `jwt-auth` for signing and verifying JWTs.
    4.  **Generate the secret key during application setup or deployment:**  Ideally, generate the `JWT_SECRET` automatically during the initial setup or deployment process, rather than manually creating it and ensure it's properly configured for `jwt-auth` to use.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **JWT Secret Key Brute-Force/Guessing (High Severity):**  Weak secrets used by `jwt-auth` are vulnerable to brute-force attacks, allowing attackers to forge valid JWTs.
    *   **JWT Signature Forgery (High Severity):** If the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth` is compromised, attackers can forge JWTs, bypassing authentication and authorization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **JWT Secret Key Brute-Force/Guessing (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the likelihood of successful brute-force or guessing attacks against the `jwt-auth` secret.
    *   **JWT Signature Forgery (High Impact):** Makes signature forgery practically impossible within `jwt-auth` if the secret remains secure.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented during initial project setup. The `JWT_SECRET` is generated using `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes` during deployment and stored in `.env` file, which is then used by `jwt-auth` configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation currently related to `jwt-auth`'s usage of the secret. Regular review of key generation process is recommended during security audits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Secure JWT Secret Key Storage (for JWT-Auth)](./mitigation_strategies/2__secure_jwt_secret_key_storage__for_jwt-auth_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure JWT Secret Key Storage (for JWT-Auth)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Environment Variables:** Store the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth` in environment variables (e.g., `.env` file in development, server environment variables in production). `jwt-auth` is configured to read the secret from environment variables by default.
    2.  **Avoid Hardcoding:**  Never embed the `JWT_SECRET` directly within the application code (PHP files, configuration files within the codebase) that `jwt-auth` uses.
    3.  **Restrict Access to Environment Variables:**  Configure server and deployment environments to restrict access to environment variables containing the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth` to only authorized processes and users.
    4.  **Consider Secrets Management Systems (Production):** For production environments, explore using dedicated secrets management systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault for enhanced security and centralized secret management of the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth`.
    5.  **Secure `.env` file (Development):** In development, ensure the `.env` file containing `JWT_SECRET` is not committed to version control and is properly secured on developer machines.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **JWT Secret Key Exposure via Code Repository (High Severity):** Hardcoding secrets used by `jwt-auth` in code makes them easily accessible if the code repository is compromised.
    *   **JWT Secret Key Exposure via Server Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):**  Improper server configuration could potentially expose environment variables containing the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **JWT Secret Key Exposure via Code Repository (High Impact):** Eliminates the risk of secret exposure through code repositories for the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth`.
    *   **JWT Secret Key Exposure via Server Misconfiguration (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of exposure through server misconfigurations by separating secrets from web-accessible files, ensuring `jwt-auth` reads from secure sources.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented. `JWT_SECRET` is stored in the `.env` file (not committed to Git) and accessed via `env('JWT_SECRET')` in the application, which is the standard way `jwt-auth` expects to find the secret. In production, it's set as a server environment variable.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider migrating to a dedicated secrets management system for production in the future for enhanced security and auditability of the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. JWT Secret Key Rotation (with JWT-Auth)](./mitigation_strategies/3__jwt_secret_key_rotation__with_jwt-auth_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** JWT Secret Key Rotation (with JWT-Auth)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement a Key Rotation Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for rotating the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth` (e.g., every 3-6 months, or triggered by security events).
    2.  **Generate a New Secret Key:** When rotating, generate a new strong secret key using the same secure generation process as initial key creation for `jwt-auth`.
    3.  **Update Application Configuration:** Update the application's environment variables or secrets management system with the new `JWT_SECRET` that `jwt-auth` will use.
    4.  **Graceful Transition Period:**  Implement a mechanism to support both the old and new secret keys for a short transition period. This allows existing valid JWTs signed with the old key (by `jwt-auth`) to remain valid until they expire, preventing immediate session invalidation for all users.  `jwt-auth` might require custom implementation for this graceful transition.
    5.  **Invalidate Old Keys:** After the transition period, remove support for the old secret key in the `jwt-auth` configuration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prolonged Impact of Secret Key Compromise (Medium Severity):** If the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth` is compromised, regular rotation limits the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit it.
    *   **Insider Threat (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk if the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth` is leaked by an insider, as the key will eventually be rotated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prolonged Impact of Secret Key Compromise (Medium Impact):** Significantly reduces the long-term impact of a potential compromise of the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Insider Threat (Medium Impact):** Mitigates the risk associated with long-lived secrets in insider threat scenarios related to `jwt-auth`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, not currently implemented. Key rotation for `jwt-auth` is a planned feature.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Key rotation logic needs to be implemented specifically for `jwt-auth`. This includes:
    *   A script or process to generate and update the `JWT_SECRET` used by `jwt-auth`.
    *   Code changes to `jwt-auth` configuration or custom middleware to handle multiple valid secret keys during the transition period for `jwt-auth` generated tokens.
    *   Documentation and procedures for performing key rotation for `jwt-auth`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Enforce Strong JWT Algorithm (in JWT-Auth Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/4__enforce_strong_jwt_algorithm__in_jwt-auth_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong JWT Algorithm (in JWT-Auth Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explicitly Configure Algorithm:** In the `jwt-auth` configuration file (`config/jwt.php`), explicitly set the `algo` option to a strong algorithm like `HS256` or `RS256`. This directly dictates the algorithm `jwt-auth` will use.
    2.  **Verify Configuration:** Double-check the `config/jwt.php` configuration file to ensure the `algo` is correctly set and not commented out or set to a weak algorithm for `jwt-auth`.
    3.  **Avoid Weak Algorithms:**  Never use algorithms like `none` or `HS1` in `jwt-auth` configuration.  `jwt-auth` defaults to `HS256`, but always explicitly verify the configuration.
    4.  **Understand Algorithm Choice:** Choose between symmetric (HS256) and asymmetric (RS256) algorithms in `jwt-auth` configuration based on your application's needs and key management capabilities. For most common use cases with `jwt-auth`, `HS256` is sufficient and simpler to manage.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Algorithm Confusion Attack (High Severity):**  Using weak or allowing algorithm negotiation in `jwt-auth` can make the application vulnerable to algorithm confusion attacks where attackers can manipulate the JWT header to use a weaker or `none` algorithm, bypassing signature verification performed by `jwt-auth`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Algorithm Confusion Attack (High Impact):**  Completely eliminates the risk of algorithm confusion attacks when using `jwt-auth` by enforcing a strong, pre-defined algorithm in its configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented. `config/jwt.php` is configured to use `HS256` algorithm for `jwt-auth`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation. Configuration should be reviewed during security audits to ensure it remains correctly set for `jwt-auth`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Strict JWT Signature Verification (using JWT-Auth Middleware)](./mitigation_strategies/5__strict_jwt_signature_verification__using_jwt-auth_middleware_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict JWT Signature Verification (using JWT-Auth Middleware)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `jwt-auth` Middleware:** Ensure that `jwt-auth`'s middleware (e.g., `\Tymon\JWTAuth\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class`) is correctly applied to all routes that require JWT authentication provided by `jwt-auth`.
    2.  **Avoid Bypassing Middleware:**  Do not create exceptions or bypass the authentication middleware provided by `jwt-auth` for any routes that should be protected by JWT authentication.
    3.  **Review Middleware Configuration:**  Verify the middleware configuration in your route definitions or middleware groups to confirm `jwt-auth`'s middleware is correctly applied.
    4.  **Log Signature Verification Failures:** Implement logging to capture any instances where JWT signature verification by `jwt-auth` fails. This can help detect potential attacks or configuration issues related to `jwt-auth`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **JWT Signature Bypass (High Severity):** If signature verification by `jwt-auth` is not strictly enforced, attackers can send unsigned or improperly signed JWTs and potentially bypass authentication.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** While HTTPS protects against token interception, strict signature verification by `jwt-auth` ensures that even if a token is somehow modified in transit, it will be rejected.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **JWT Signature Bypass (High Impact):**  Completely prevents signature bypass attacks when using `jwt-auth` by ensuring every JWT is verified by its middleware.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Impact):** Adds an extra layer of defense against token manipulation even if HTTPS is compromised (though HTTPS is the primary defense), as `jwt-auth` will verify the signature.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented. `\Tymon\JWTAuth\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class` middleware is applied to all API routes requiring authentication in `routes/api.php`, ensuring `jwt-auth` handles verification.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Logging of signature verification failures within `jwt-auth`'s middleware is not currently implemented. This should be added for monitoring and security auditing of `jwt-auth` operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. Implement Short-Lived Access Tokens (in JWT-Auth)](./mitigation_strategies/6__implement_short-lived_access_tokens__in_jwt-auth_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Short-Lived Access Tokens (in JWT-Auth)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Token TTL:** In `config/jwt.php`, adjust the `ttl` (time-to-live) setting to a short duration (e.g., 15-60 minutes). This setting directly controls the expiration time for access tokens generated by `jwt-auth`.
    2.  **Balance Security and User Experience:** Choose a TTL value in `jwt-auth` configuration that balances security (shorter TTL is more secure) with user experience (longer TTL reduces the frequency of token refresh requests when using `jwt-auth`).
    3.  **Communicate Token Expiration to Client:**  Inform the client-side application about the token expiration time of tokens issued by `jwt-auth` so it can proactively handle token refresh before expiration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Access Token Compromise - Reduced Window of Opportunity (Medium Severity):** If an access token generated by `jwt-auth` is compromised, its short lifespan limits the time window during which it can be misused by an attacker.
    *   **Session Hijacking - Reduced Duration (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the duration of a successful session hijacking attack if an access token issued by `jwt-auth` is stolen.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Access Token Compromise - Reduced Window of Opportunity (Medium Impact):** Significantly reduces the impact of a compromised access token generated by `jwt-auth` by limiting its validity period.
    *   **Session Hijacking - Reduced Duration (Medium Impact):** Limits the duration of a session hijacking attack involving tokens from `jwt-auth`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented. `ttl` in `config/jwt.php` is set to 60 minutes for tokens generated by `jwt-auth`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Client-side application needs to be improved to proactively handle token expiration and refresh more gracefully, potentially using token expiration information from the JWT payload issued by `jwt-auth`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [7. Utilize Refresh Tokens (with JWT-Auth)](./mitigation_strategies/7__utilize_refresh_tokens__with_jwt-auth_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Refresh Tokens (with JWT-Auth)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Refresh Token Flow:** Implement the refresh token flow provided by `jwt-auth` or a custom refresh token mechanism that works with `jwt-auth`. This typically involves issuing a refresh token along with the access token upon successful login using `jwt-auth`'s functionalities.
    2.  **Longer Refresh Token Expiration:** Configure refresh tokens with a longer expiration time than access tokens (e.g., days or weeks) when using `jwt-auth`'s refresh token features.
    3.  **Secure Refresh Token Storage:** Store refresh tokens securely, preferably using HttpOnly, Secure cookies or secure server-side storage linked to user sessions. This is crucial for refresh tokens managed in conjunction with `jwt-auth`. Avoid storing refresh tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` if possible.
    4.  **Refresh Token Rotation:** Implement refresh token rotation: when a new access token is issued using a refresh token (via `jwt-auth`'s refresh endpoint), invalidate the old refresh token and issue a new one. This limits the lifespan of a compromised refresh token used with `jwt-auth`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Long-Lived Access Token Necessity (Medium Severity):**  Without refresh tokens, developers might be tempted to issue long-lived access tokens with `jwt-auth`, increasing the risk of compromise. Refresh tokens allow for short-lived access tokens while maintaining user session persistence when used with `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Refresh Token Compromise - Reduced Impact (Medium Severity):** Refresh token rotation limits the impact of a compromised refresh token used with `jwt-auth` by invalidating it upon use.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Long-Lived Access Token Necessity (High Impact):** Eliminates the need for long-lived access tokens generated by `jwt-auth`, significantly improving security.
    *   **Refresh Token Compromise - Reduced Impact (Medium Impact):** Reduces the impact of a compromised refresh token used with `jwt-auth` by limiting its reusability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Refresh token generation and usage for access token renewal is implemented using `jwt-auth`'s refresh functionality. Refresh tokens are currently stored in HttpOnly, Secure cookies.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Refresh token rotation is not yet implemented for `jwt-auth`'s refresh tokens.  This needs to be added to further enhance refresh token security. Server-side storage of refresh tokens (managed alongside `jwt-auth`) could also be considered for enhanced control and revocation capabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [8. Invalidate Tokens on Logout and Security Events (related to JWT-Auth)](./mitigation_strategies/8__invalidate_tokens_on_logout_and_security_events__related_to_jwt-auth_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Invalidate Tokens on Logout and Security Events (related to JWT-Auth)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Logout Functionality:**  Create a logout endpoint that invalidates both access and refresh tokens associated with the user's session. This should include invalidating tokens issued and managed by `jwt-auth`. For cookie-based storage, this involves clearing the cookies where `jwt-auth` stores tokens. For server-side storage, it involves removing the token record associated with `jwt-auth`'s tokens.
    2.  **Token Invalidation on Password Change:**  When a user changes their password, invalidate all active access and refresh tokens associated with their account that were issued by `jwt-auth`.
    3.  **Token Invalidation on Account Compromise:**  Implement a mechanism to invalidate tokens issued by `jwt-auth` if an account is suspected of being compromised (e.g., through administrative actions or automated security alerts).
    4.  **Consider Token Blacklisting (Optional):** For immediate revocation needs of tokens issued by `jwt-auth`, consider implementing a token blacklist or revocation list. This adds complexity and performance overhead but allows for immediate invalidation of specific tokens generated by `jwt-auth`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Persistent Session After Logout (Medium Severity):** Without token invalidation on logout, access and refresh tokens issued by `jwt-auth` might remain valid, allowing continued access even after a user intends to log out.
    *   **Session Persistence After Security Events (High Severity):** If tokens from `jwt-auth` are not invalidated after password changes or account compromises, attackers could potentially continue to use compromised tokens.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Persistent Session After Logout (Medium Impact):** Ensures proper session termination upon logout, including invalidating tokens from `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Session Persistence After Security Events (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of continued unauthorized access after security-related events by invalidating tokens from `jwt-auth`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Logout functionality clears cookies, effectively invalidating tokens stored in cookies by `jwt-auth`. Token invalidation on password change is implemented, targeting tokens issued by `jwt-auth`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Token invalidation on account compromise (e.g., administrative account suspension) is not fully implemented for tokens issued by `jwt-auth`.  Token blacklisting for `jwt-auth` tokens is not implemented and might be considered for future enhancement if immediate revocation becomes a critical requirement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [9. Validate Essential JWT Claims (in Application Logic using JWT-Auth)](./mitigation_strategies/9__validate_essential_jwt_claims__in_application_logic_using_jwt-auth_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate Essential JWT Claims (in Application Logic using JWT-Auth)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify `iss` (Issuer) Claim:**  Validate that the `iss` claim in the JWT generated by `jwt-auth` matches the expected issuer of your application. This helps prevent token reuse from other applications, even if they are using `jwt-auth`.
    2.  **Verify `aud` (Audience) Claim:**  If applicable, validate the `aud` claim to ensure the token from `jwt-auth` is intended for your application or service.
    3.  **Verify `exp` (Expiration) Claim:**  `jwt-auth` handles expiration automatically, but it's good practice to be aware of this and potentially add explicit checks in critical authorization logic if needed, especially when working with tokens from `jwt-auth`.
    4.  **Custom Claim Validation:** Validate any custom claims included in your JWTs generated by `jwt-auth` that are relevant to your application's authorization logic.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Validating `iss` and `aud` claims helps mitigate token replay attacks where tokens issued for one application (even if using `jwt-auth`) might be reused in another.
    *   **Expired Token Usage (Low Severity):** While `jwt-auth` handles expiration, explicit checks can provide an extra layer of assurance when dealing with tokens from `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Claim Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Validating custom claims ensures that authorization decisions are based on expected and valid claim values within tokens from `jwt-auth`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Replay Attacks (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of token replay attacks across different applications, even those potentially using `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Expired Token Usage (Low Impact):** Provides a minor additional check against expired tokens generated by `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Claim Manipulation (Medium Impact):**  Ensures authorization logic relies on valid and expected claim data within tokens from `jwt-auth`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `jwt-auth` handles `exp` claim validation. `iss` and `aud` claims are not explicitly validated in application logic beyond what `jwt-auth` might do internally.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit validation of `iss` and `aud` claims should be added to the application's authentication middleware or authorization logic for enhanced security, especially if the application interacts with other services or applications and relies on tokens from `jwt-auth`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [10. Sanitize and Validate User Data in Claims (Used with JWT-Auth)](./mitigation_strategies/10__sanitize_and_validate_user_data_in_claims__used_with_jwt-auth_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize and Validate User Data in Claims (Used with JWT-Auth)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sanitize Data Before Adding to Claims:** Before adding user data to JWT claims (e.g., user roles, permissions) that will be included in tokens generated by `jwt-auth`, sanitize the data to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., escaping special characters).
    2.  **Validate Data Retrieved from Claims:** When retrieving user data from JWT claims (from tokens generated by `jwt-auth`) for authorization decisions, validate the data to ensure it conforms to expected formats and values.
    3.  **Minimize Data in Claims:** Avoid storing excessive or sensitive user data directly in JWT claims within tokens generated by `jwt-auth`. Store only essential information needed for authentication and basic authorization.
    4.  **Fetch User Details from Backend:** Consider using JWTs (from `jwt-auth`) primarily for authentication and fetching detailed user information from a secure backend service based on the user ID in the token, rather than embedding all user details in the JWT claims generated by `jwt-auth`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Injection via Claims (Medium Severity):** If user data in claims of tokens from `jwt-auth` is not sanitized, attackers might be able to inject malicious data that could be exploited in application logic.
    *   **Authorization Bypass via Claim Manipulation (Medium Severity):** If claim data in tokens from `jwt-auth` is not validated, attackers might be able to manipulate claims to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Claims (Low Severity):** Storing excessive user data in claims of tokens from `jwt-auth` increases the potential for information disclosure if JWTs are intercepted or logged improperly.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Injection via Claims (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of data injection vulnerabilities through JWT claims in tokens from `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Authorization Bypass via Claim Manipulation (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of authorization bypass due to manipulated claim data in tokens from `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Claims (Low Impact):** Minimizes the amount of potentially sensitive data exposed in JWT claims of tokens from `jwt-auth`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. User roles added to claims are validated for format, but explicit sanitization of user data before adding to claims in tokens generated by `jwt-auth` is not consistently applied.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement consistent sanitization of user data before adding it to JWT claims in tokens generated by `jwt-auth`.  Review and minimize the amount of user data stored in claims within tokens from `jwt-auth`. Consider fetching user details from a backend service instead of embedding them in JWTs generated by `jwt-auth`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [11. Limit JWT Claim Size (in JWT-Auth Tokens)](./mitigation_strategies/11__limit_jwt_claim_size__in_jwt-auth_tokens_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit JWT Claim Size (in JWT-Auth Tokens)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Store Minimal Data in Claims:** Only include essential information in JWT claims of tokens generated by `jwt-auth`, such as user ID, roles (if necessary for basic authorization), and expiration time.
    2.  **Avoid Storing Large Objects or Arrays:** Do not store large objects, arrays, or extensive lists of permissions directly in JWT claims of tokens generated by `jwt-auth`.
    3.  **Use References Instead of Data:**  Instead of embedding data in JWT claims of tokens from `jwt-auth`, consider using references (e.g., user ID) and fetching detailed user information from a backend service when needed.
    4.  **Compress JWTs (Less Common):** In very specific scenarios where JWT size of tokens from `jwt-auth` is a significant concern, consider JWT compression techniques, but be aware of potential complexity and compatibility issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Request Overhead (Low Severity):** Large JWTs generated by `jwt-auth` increase the size of HTTP requests, potentially impacting performance, especially on mobile networks.
    *   **Information Disclosure - Increased Exposure (Low Severity):** Larger JWTs from `jwt-auth` expose more data if intercepted or logged, increasing the potential for information disclosure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Request Overhead (Low Impact):** Reduces request overhead by minimizing JWT size of tokens generated by `jwt-auth`.
    *   **Information Disclosure - Increased Exposure (Low Impact):** Minimizes the amount of data exposed in JWTs generated by `jwt-auth`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Efforts are made to keep claims minimal in tokens from `jwt-auth`, but there's no strict enforcement or monitoring of JWT size.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement guidelines and code reviews to ensure JWT claims in tokens from `jwt-auth` are kept minimal.  Consider monitoring JWT size in development and production to identify and address any potential issues related to tokens generated by `jwt-auth`.
