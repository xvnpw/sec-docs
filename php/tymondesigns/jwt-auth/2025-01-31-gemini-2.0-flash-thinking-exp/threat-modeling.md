# Threat Model Analysis for tymondesigns/jwt-auth

## Threat: [Secret Key Exposure](./threats/secret_key_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `JWT_SECRET` key used by `jwt-auth`. This could occur through various means such as server compromise, access to configuration files, or code repository leaks. With the exposed secret key, an attacker can forge valid JWTs for any user, effectively impersonating them and gaining full access to the application.
*   **Impact:** Complete account takeover for any user, full unauthorized access to application resources and data, potential data breaches, and severe reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration (`JWT_SECRET` environment variable)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Employ secure storage mechanisms for the `JWT_SECRET`, such as environment variables or dedicated secret management systems.
    *   Strictly control access to server configurations, deployment pipelines, and code repositories.
    *   Implement a policy for regular rotation of the `JWT_SECRET` key.
    *   Generate and utilize strong, cryptographically random secrets for `JWT_SECRET`.

## Threat: [Weak Secret Key](./threats/weak_secret_key.md)

*   **Description:** The `JWT_SECRET` configured for `jwt-auth` is weak, easily guessable, or susceptible to brute-force attacks. If an attacker obtains a sample JWT, they could attempt offline brute-force attacks to recover the weak secret. Successful recovery allows them to forge JWTs and bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to application resources, potential data breaches. While potentially requiring more effort than direct secret exposure, it still poses a significant risk.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration (`JWT_SECRET` environment variable), Signature Verification (indirectly)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong secret key generation policies during setup and configuration.
    *   Utilize cryptographically secure random string generators to create the `JWT_SECRET`.
    *   Conduct regular audits to assess the strength of the configured `JWT_SECRET` and enforce updates if necessary.

## Threat: [Algorithm Confusion/Substitution](./threats/algorithm_confusionsubstitution.md)

*   **Description:** Although `jwt-auth` is designed to enforce configured algorithms, vulnerabilities in the underlying JWT libraries or misconfiguration could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the JWT header to use a weaker or no algorithm (e.g., `none`). This bypasses the intended signature verification process, enabling JWT forgery without knowing the secret key.
*   **Impact:** Complete bypass of signature verification, enabling JWT forgery, leading to unauthorized access and potential privilege escalation within the application.
*   **Affected Component:** JWT Parsing and Verification (`lcobucci/jwt` dependency, `jwt-auth` middleware)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly configure and enforce a strong, specific algorithm (e.g., `HS256`, `RS256`) within the `jwt-auth` configuration.
    *   Maintain up-to-date versions of `jwt-auth` and its dependency `lcobucci/jwt` to patch any algorithm-related vulnerabilities.
    *   When using asymmetric algorithms like `RS256`, ensure proper and secure management of public and private keys, using the public key only for verification.

## Threat: [JWT Injection/Manipulation](./threats/jwt_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to modify the JWT payload or header after it has been issued by the application, hoping to alter claims or bypass validation. If `jwt-auth` or the underlying JWT library has vulnerabilities in parsing or signature verification, or if validation is not correctly implemented, these manipulations could be successful.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation if claims related to authorization are manipulated, potential data manipulation if claims control application logic.
*   **Affected Component:** JWT Validation (`jwt-auth` middleware, `lcobucci/jwt` dependency)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on `jwt-auth`'s built-in signature verification mechanisms to ensure JWT integrity.
    *   Implement custom claim validation logic where necessary to enforce application-specific authorization rules.
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any data extracted from JWT claims before using it in security-sensitive operations.
    *   Ensure all JWT communication occurs over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that could facilitate JWT interception and manipulation.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `jwt-auth` or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__jwt-auth__or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered within the `tymondesigns/jwt-auth` library itself or its dependencies, such as `lcobucci/jwt`. If applications are not promptly updated to address these vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them to compromise the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** The impact varies depending on the specific vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure and authentication bypass to remote code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire `jwt-auth` library and its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain a proactive approach to dependency management by keeping `jwt-auth` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    *   Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `jwt-auth` and `lcobucci/jwt`.
    *   Establish a vulnerability management process to promptly assess, patch, and mitigate any reported security issues.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of `jwt-auth`](./threats/misconfiguration_of__jwt-auth_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers may misconfigure `jwt-auth` settings, leading to insecure deployments. Examples include using insecure or weak algorithms, disabling signature verification entirely, or improperly configuring claim validation. Such misconfigurations can weaken or completely bypass the intended security benefits of JWT authentication.
*   **Impact:** Weakened or bypassed authentication, leading to unauthorized access, potential data breaches, and various attack vectors depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration (`config/jwt.php`, `.env` variables), `jwt-auth` service provider.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (in cases of severe misconfiguration leading to authentication bypass)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review the official `jwt-auth` documentation and adhere to security best practices during configuration.
    *   Utilize secure configuration defaults and carefully scrutinize any customizations for potential security implications.
    *   Implement configuration validation checks during application startup to detect and prevent insecure configurations before deployment.
    *   Conduct regular security code reviews to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations in `jwt-auth` setup.
