## Attack Tree Path: [1. Token Forgery/Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/1__token_forgerymanipulation.md)

*   **1.1 Weak Secret Key [CRITICAL]**
    *   Description: The foundation of JWT security.  A weak or compromised secret key allows attackers to forge valid tokens.
    *   **1.1.1 Brute Force [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description:  The attacker tries many different keys until one works.  Feasible if the secret is short or has low entropy.
        *   Likelihood: Low (if a strong key is used), High (if a weak key is used)
        *   Impact: Very High (complete compromise)
        *   Effort: High (for strong keys), Low (for weak keys)
        *   Skill Level: Beginner (for weak keys), Advanced (for strong keys)
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (failed login attempts might be logged)
    *   **1.1.2 Predictable Secret [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: The secret is based on something easily guessable (e.g., "secret", the application name, a dictionary word).
        *   Likelihood: Low (if developers follow best practices), Medium (if poor practices are used)
        *   Impact: Very High (complete compromise)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Beginner
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard (unless the secret is exposed publicly)

*   **1.2 Algorithm Substitution**
    *   **1.2.2 None Algorithm [CRITICAL]**
        *   Description: The attacker sets the algorithm to "none," indicating no signature.  A poorly configured server might accept this, bypassing all signature verification.
        *   Likelihood: Very Low (if the library is properly configured)
        *   Impact: Very High (complete compromise)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Beginner
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (if the server logs invalid tokens)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Token Leakage/Interception](./attack_tree_paths/2__token_leakageinterception.md)

*   **2.1 MITM (Implicitly Critical)**
    *   Description: Although not explicitly in the sub-tree *if* HTTPS is correctly implemented, the *absence* of HTTPS or a misconfiguration makes this a critical and easily exploitable vulnerability.  The attacker intercepts the token during transmission.
    *   Likelihood: Low (if HTTPS is properly implemented), High (if HTTP is used or HTTPS is misconfigured)
    *   Impact: High (token compromise)
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Hard (without specialized network monitoring)

*   **2.2 Client-Side Storage Vulnerabilities**
    *   **2.2.1 XSS [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the application, which can then access the token if it's stored in a place accessible to JavaScript (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or a non-HttpOnly cookie).
        *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on the application's overall security)
        *   Impact: High (token compromise)
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (if WAF or security tools are in place)

*   **2.3 Server-Side Storage Vulnerabilities**
    *   **2.3.1 Log Files [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: The token is accidentally logged (e.g., in request logs).
        *   Likelihood: Low (if logging is properly configured), Medium (if developers are careless)
        *   Impact: High (token compromise)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Beginner
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (if logs are regularly reviewed)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **3.1 Known CVEs (Past/Present)**
    *   **3.1.1, 3.1.2 Specific CVE [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the `jwt-auth` library.
        *   Likelihood: Medium (if the library is not updated), Very Low (if the library is updated)
        *   Impact: Varies (depends on the specific CVE), potentially Very High
        *   Effort: Varies (depends on the specific CVE), potentially Low
        *   Skill Level: Varies (depends on the specific CVE), potentially Script Kiddie
        *   Detection Difficulty: Varies (depends on the specific CVE), potentially Easy (if intrusion detection systems are in place)

*   **3.3 Configuration Errors in jwt-auth**
    *   **3.3.1 Invalid TTL Settings [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: Tokens are valid for too long, increasing the window of opportunity for an attacker if a token is compromised.
        *   Likelihood: Medium (if developers don't understand token lifetimes)
        *   Impact: Medium (increased window of opportunity for attackers)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Beginner
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard (unless token usage patterns are closely monitored)
    *   **3.3.2 Incorrect Refresh Token Handling [HIGH RISK]**
        *   Description: Refresh tokens are not properly validated or are vulnerable to replay attacks, leading to persistent unauthorized access.
        *   Likelihood: Medium (if developers don't understand refresh token best practices)
        *   Impact: High (potential for long-term unauthorized access)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard (unless refresh token usage patterns are closely monitored)
