# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tymondesigns/jwt-auth

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Secret and Explicit Algorithm Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/strong_secret_and_explicit_algorithm_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Secret:** Use the `php artisan jwt:secret` command to generate a cryptographically secure random `JWT_SECRET`. Verify the generated key's length (at least 64 characters) and randomness.
    2.  **Explicit Algorithm:** In `config/jwt.php`, *explicitly* set the `algo` key to the desired signing algorithm (e.g., `'RS256'` or `'HS256'`).  Do *not* rely on the library's default.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **JWT Secret Key Compromise:** (Severity: **Critical**) - A strong secret makes it computationally infeasible to forge signatures.
    *   **Algorithm Confusion/Downgrade Attacks:** (Severity: **High**) - Explicitly setting the algorithm prevents attackers from forcing the use of a weaker algorithm.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **JWT Secret Key Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced (though secure storage and rotation are still crucial).
    *   **Algorithm Confusion/Downgrade Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Strong Secret Generation:** Partially implemented - `php artisan jwt:secret` is used, but key length/randomness verification is in `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`.
    *   **Explicit Algorithm Configuration:** Implemented - `algo` is set in `config/jwt.php`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None, assuming the secret is strong and the algorithm is correctly configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Short-Lived Tokens and Refresh Token Usage](./mitigation_strategies/short-lived_tokens_and_refresh_token_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Short `ttl`:** In `config/jwt.php`, set the `ttl` (time to live) to a short value (e.g., 15-60 minutes). This limits the lifespan of access tokens.
    2.  **Refresh Token Implementation:** Utilize `tymondesigns/jwt-auth`'s built-in refresh token functionality.  This involves:
        *   Using `JWTAuth::refresh()` to obtain a new access token using a valid refresh token.
        *   Configuring the refresh token's time-to-live (`refresh_ttl` in `config/jwt.php`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Replay Attacks:** (Severity: **High**) - Short `ttl` reduces the window for replay.
    *   **Token Compromise:** (Severity: **High**) - Limits the damage if an access token is stolen.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Replay Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Token Compromise:** Impact significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Short `ttl`:** Partially implemented - `ttl` is set, but could be shorter.
    *   **Refresh Token Implementation:** Partially implemented - Refresh tokens are used, but not one-time use (one-time use is *outside* the direct scope of the library).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`ttl` Optimization:** Requires careful consideration of user experience and security trade-offs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [JWT ID (jti) Claim and Library's Blacklist (Cache-Based)](./mitigation_strategies/jwt_id__jti__claim_and_library's_blacklist__cache-based_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`jti` Claim:** Ensure that each issued JWT includes a unique `jti` (JWT ID) claim.  `tymondesigns/jwt-auth` *does this automatically*.
    2.  **Library's Blacklist (Cache):** Utilize the library's built-in, cache-based blacklist. This is the *default* behavior.  When you invalidate a token (e.g., on logout), use `JWTAuth::invalidate($token)`. This adds the `jti` to the cache.  The library automatically checks the cache during token validation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Replay Attacks:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents reuse of invalidated tokens (within the cache's limitations).
    *   **Token Compromise:** (Severity: **High**) - Allows invalidation of compromised tokens (within the cache's limitations).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced, but the cache-based blacklist has limitations (see below).
    *   **Token Compromise:** Impact reduced, but the cache-based blacklist has limitations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **`jti` Claim:** Implemented - Automatic by the library.
    *   **Library's Blacklist (Cache):** Likely implemented (default behavior), but needs verification.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Verification of Blacklist Usage:** Ensure `JWTAuth::invalidate($token)` is being called correctly on logout and other invalidation events.  The *limitations* of the cache-based blacklist (not persistent across server restarts or multiple instances) are important to understand.  A database-backed blacklist is *better* but *outside* the scope of this focused list.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Payload Handling (within Library Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_payload_handling__within_library_usage_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Signature Verification:** *Always* use `JWTAuth::parseToken()->authenticate()` (or equivalent methods like `JWTAuth::attempt()`) to validate the token's signature *before* accessing any data from the payload. This is the *intended and correct* way to use the library.
    2. **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Do not store sensitive data directly in the JWT payload.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Tampering (Payload Modification):** (Severity: **High**) - Signature verification prevents unauthorized modification.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Tampering:** Risk reduced to near zero with correct library usage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Signature Verification:** Implemented - Standard library usage.
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Partially Implemented - Review payload.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Payload Review:** Requires a thorough review of the data currently included in the JWT payload.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Generic Error Messages (with Library Exceptions)](./mitigation_strategies/generic_error_messages__with_library_exceptions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Custom Exception Handling:** Wrap calls to `JWTAuth` methods (e.g., `parseToken`, `authenticate`, `refresh`) in `try-catch` blocks.  Specifically, catch exceptions of type `Tymon\JWTAuth\Exceptions\JWTException` and its subclasses (e.g., `TokenExpiredException`, `TokenInvalidException`).
    2.  **Generic Responses:** In the `catch` block, *do not* return the specific exception message from the library to the client. Return a generic error message (e.g., "Unauthorized", "Invalid token") and an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 401).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents attackers from gaining insights into the JWT validation process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Custom Exception Handling:** Partially implemented - Some exception handling exists, but needs review for consistency and specific `JWTException` types.
    *   **Generic Responses:** Partially implemented - Needs consistent application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent Exception Handling and Generic Responses:** Requires a review of all JWT-related code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Standard Claims Validation (within Library Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/standard_claims_validation__within_library_usage_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`iat` (Issued At) Claim:** `tymondesigns/jwt-auth` automatically includes and validates `iat`.
    2.  **`exp` (Expiration Time) Claim:** `tymondesigns/jwt-auth` automatically includes and validates `exp` based on the configured `ttl`.
    3.  **`nbf` (Not Before) Claim:** If you use `nbf`, `tymondesigns/jwt-auth` will validate it. You would set this when creating the token if needed.
    4.  **`aud` (Audience) Claim:** While the library doesn't *enforce* `aud` validation, you can easily add it.
        *   When creating the token, include the `aud` claim: `$token = JWTAuth::claims(['aud' => 'your-audience'])->attempt($credentials);`
        *   After retrieving the payload (but *before* full authentication), check the `aud` claim:
            ```php
            try {
                $payload = JWTAuth::getPayload($token); // Get payload *without* full validation
                if ($payload['aud'] !== 'your-audience') {
                    // Handle invalid audience
                    return response()->json(['error' => 'Invalid audience'], 401);
                }
                $user = JWTAuth::parseToken()->authenticate(); // Now do full validation
            } catch (JWTException $e) {
                // Handle other JWT exceptions
                return response()->json(['error' => 'Invalid token'], 401);
            }

            ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Misuse:** (Severity: **Medium**) - `aud` prevents tokens intended for one application from being used in another.
    *   **Token Replay (with `iat`, `exp` and `nbf`):** (Severity: **Medium**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Misuse:** Risk significantly reduced if `aud` is properly implemented.
    *   **Token Replay:** Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **`iat` Claim:** Implemented (automatic).
    *   **`exp` Claim:** Implemented (automatic).
    *   **`nbf` Claim:** Not implemented (but supported if used).
    *   **`aud` Claim:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`aud` Claim:** Requires adding the claim when creating tokens and adding the validation check shown above.
    *   **`nbf` Claim:** Only if you need to issue tokens that are not valid until a future time.
