Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing on elements directly involving CodeIgniter with high or critical severity:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Output**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** If developers don't use CodeIgniter's output escaping functions (like `esc()`) in views, user-provided data or data from the database can be rendered directly, allowing for script injection.
    *   **Example:** A comment form where user input is directly displayed without escaping: `<h1><?php echo $comment; ?></h1>`. An attacker could submit a comment like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always use CodeIgniter's `esc()` function or other appropriate output encoding methods (e.g., `htmlentities()`) when displaying user-generated content or data from untrusted sources in views. Choose the appropriate escaping context (HTML, JavaScript, URL, CSS).

*   **SQL Injection (if not using Query Builder correctly)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into database interactions.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** While CodeIgniter's Query Builder provides protection, developers using raw queries or not properly escaping data within Query Builder can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**  Using a raw query with unsanitized input: `$this->db->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_GET['username'] . "'");`. An attacker could provide a username like `' OR '1'='1`.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Primarily use CodeIgniter's Query Builder with bound parameters or proper escaping for all database interactions. Avoid using raw queries whenever possible. If raw queries are necessary, meticulously sanitize and escape user input using database-specific escaping functions.

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Token Bypass**
    *   **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** If CSRF protection is not enabled or implemented correctly (e.g., missing tokens, improper validation), the application becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A form submission without a CSRF token. An attacker could craft a malicious link or embed a form on another website that, when clicked by an authenticated user, performs an action on the CodeIgniter application.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user (e.g., changing passwords, making purchases).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure CodeIgniter's CSRF protection is enabled in the configuration. Use the `form_open()` helper to automatically include CSRF tokens in forms. Validate CSRF tokens on form submissions. Consider using `CSRF Regeneration` for enhanced security.

*   **Insecure File Uploads**
    *   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files that can be executed on the server or used for other malicious purposes.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** If file upload handling is not properly implemented, including insufficient validation of file types, sizes, and names, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Allowing uploads of `.php` files without proper validation and storing them in a publicly accessible directory. An attacker could upload a backdoor script.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just extensions. Limit file sizes. Sanitize file names. Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in directories with restricted execution permissions. Implement proper access controls for uploaded files.

*   **Session Hijacking/Fixation**
    *   **Description:** Attackers steal or manipulate user session IDs to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** If session configuration is insecure (e.g., using default session names, not using HTTPS, not regenerating session IDs after login), it increases the risk.
    *   **Example:** An application not using HTTPS, allowing an attacker to intercept the session cookie. Or, an application not regenerating the session ID after successful login, making it vulnerable to session fixation attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Force HTTPS for the entire application. Configure secure and HTTP-only session cookies. Regenerate session IDs after successful login. Use a strong session driver (e.g., database or Redis). Set appropriate session timeout values.
