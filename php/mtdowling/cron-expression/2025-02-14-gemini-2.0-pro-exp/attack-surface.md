# Attack Surface Analysis for mtdowling/cron-expression

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Cron Expressions](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_cron_expressions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted cron expression designed to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory) during parsing or calculation of the next execution time, leading to a denial of service.
*   **How `cron-expression` Contributes:** The library's parsing and calculation logic is the *direct* target of this attack. The complexity of the cron syntax allows for potentially resource-intensive expressions. This is the core vulnerability of using a cron parsing library.
*   **Example:**
    *   `0-59,0-59,0-59,0-59,0-59 * * * *` (Excessive comma-separated values)
    *   `1-59/9999999 * * * *` (Attempting large iteration counts, though the library *should* handle this)
    *   `*/1,*/1,*/1,*/1,*/1 * * * *` (Many divisions)
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential for complete system unresponsiveness if resource limits are not in place.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if no resource limits are enforced)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement *strict* whitelist-based validation of cron expressions. Reject *any* input that doesn't conform to a predefined, *limited* set of allowed characters and patterns.  Do *not* rely solely on the library's built-in validation.
    *   **Length Limitation:** Enforce a maximum length for the cron expression string (e.g., 255 characters, or even shorter).
    *   **Complexity Limitation:** Limit the number of components (commas, hyphens, slashes) within the expression.  Be very restrictive.
    *   **Resource Limits (Crucial):** Implement timeouts and resource quotas (CPU time, memory usage) for the cron expression parsing and calculation process. Terminate any operation that exceeds these limits. This is the *most important* mitigation, and it *must* be implemented at the application level.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Regularly perform fuzz testing with a wide range of valid and *invalid* inputs to identify potential parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation (Indirect, but Requires `cron-expression` Vulnerability)](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation__indirect__but_requires__cron-expression__vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability *within* the `cron-expression` parsing logic (e.g., a bug that allows injection of unintended values), *combined* with the scheduled task running with elevated privileges, could allow an attacker to indirectly execute arbitrary code with those privileges.  This requires a flaw *in the library itself* that allows for manipulation beyond just DoS.
*   **How `cron-expression` Contributes:** The library's parsing vulnerability is the *necessary* initial entry point. Without a flaw in how the library handles input, this escalation is not possible via the library. The escalation happens because of the *context* (high-privilege task) in which the parsed expression is used, but a library bug is *required*.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a *hypothetical* parsing vulnerability in `cron-expression` to inject a malicious command into the scheduled task's arguments (if the application uses the parsed expression to construct commands). The task runs as root, giving the attacker root access. *This relies on a bug in the library that allows more than just DoS.*
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breaches, arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run scheduled tasks with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges. Never run tasks as root or administrator unless absolutely unavoidable. This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Beyond Parsing):** Even after the cron expression is parsed by `cron-expression`, *thoroughly* sanitize any data derived from it *before* using that data to construct commands or interact with the system. This is crucial to prevent injection attacks *if* the library has a parsing flaw.
    *   **Secure Configuration:** Ensure that the system's cron daemon itself is configured securely and that access to cron configuration files is restricted.
    * **Assume Library Vulnerability:** Because this is critical, operate under the assumption that the library *might* have an undiscovered parsing vulnerability. The other mitigations are designed to limit the impact of such a vulnerability.
