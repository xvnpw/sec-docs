## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation (Whitelisting)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation__whitelisting_.md)

1.  **Define Allowed Characters:** Create a regular expression that *precisely* defines the allowed characters and structure of a valid cron expression for your application.  Start with a very restrictive regex and only add what's absolutely necessary.  Example (adjust to your needs!):
    ```go
    var validCronRegex = regexp.MustCompile(`^(\*|\d+(-\d+)?(,\d+(-\d+)?)*)(/\d+)? (\*|\d+(-\d+)?(,\d+(-\d+)?)*)(/\d+)? (\*|\d+(-\d+)?(,\d+(-\d+)?)*)(/\d+)? (\*|\d+(-\d+)?(,\d+(-\d+)?)*)(/\d+)? (\*|\d+(-\d+)?(,\d+(-\d+)?)*)(/\d+)?$`);
    ```
2.  **Validate Before Parsing:**  Before calling `cron.Parse()`, use the `validCronRegex.MatchString(inputString)` function to check if the input cron expression matches the allowed pattern.
3.  **Reject Invalid Input:** If the input does *not* match the regex, immediately reject it.  Do *not* attempt to sanitize or modify the input.  Return a clear error message (e.g., "Invalid cron expression format").
4.  **Additional Range Checks (Optional but Recommended):** After the regex match, perform additional checks to ensure that the numerical values within each field are within the allowed ranges (e.g., minutes: 0-59, hours: 0-23, etc.). This adds another layer of validation.
5. **Whitelist specific non-standard descriptors:** If you use non-standard descriptors, create a list of allowed descriptors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Expressions (High Severity):** Maliciously crafted, overly complex cron expressions can cause excessive CPU and memory consumption during parsing, leading to a denial-of-service attack. Strict validation prevents these complex expressions from being processed.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):**  Invalid or unexpected cron expressions could lead to the scheduler running tasks at unintended times or with unintended frequencies.  Validation ensures only expected expressions are used.
    *   **(Low Probability, but possible) Code Execution via Unsafe Output Handling (Critical Severity):** If the *output* of the cron library (calculated dates) is used unsafely (e.g., in shell commands without escaping), a carefully crafted input *could* (though unlikely with this specific library) influence the output in a way that leads to code execution. Strict input validation minimizes the attack surface.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:**  Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by malicious cron expressions.  The risk is reduced from high to low.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Eliminates the risk of unexpected behavior due to invalid input. The risk is reduced from medium to negligible.
    *   **Code Execution:**  Indirectly reduces the risk by limiting the potential for manipulated output. The risk is reduced from low probability to extremely low probability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic regex validation is implemented in the `validateCronExpression` function in `utils/cron_validator.go`.
    *   This function is called before parsing any cron expression received from user input in the `api/schedule_task.go` endpoint.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `config/scheduler_config.go` file reads cron expressions from a configuration file.  *No validation is currently performed on these expressions.* This is a potential vulnerability if the configuration file can be tampered with.
    *   Range checks (e.g., ensuring minutes are between 0-59) are *not* currently implemented.
    *   Non-standard descriptors are not explicitly whitelisted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limitation (Timeout and Iteration Limit)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limitation__timeout_and_iteration_limit_.md)

1.  **Context with Timeout for Parsing:** Wrap all calls to `cron.Parse()` within a `context.WithTimeout()`.  This sets a maximum time limit for the parsing operation.
    ```go
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second) // Example: 5 seconds
    defer cancel()
    expr, err := cron.Parse(expression, cron.WithContext(ctx))
    ```
2.  **Context with Timeout for Date Calculation:**  Similarly, wrap calls to `GetNext()`, `GetPrev()`, and any other methods that calculate dates with a `context.WithTimeout()`.    ```go
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second) // Example: 2 seconds
    defer cancel()
    nextTime := expr.Next(currentTime, cron.WithContext(ctx))
    ```
3.  **Iteration Limit:** When calling `GetNext()` or `GetPrev()` repeatedly (e.g., to get multiple future execution times), implement a maximum iteration count to prevent infinite loops or excessively long calculations.
    ```go
    maxIterations := 100
    for i := 0; i < maxIterations; i++ {
        // ... get next execution time with timeout ...
    }
    ```
4.  **Choose Appropriate Timeout Values:**  The timeout values (e.g., 5 seconds, 2 seconds) should be chosen based on the expected complexity of the cron expressions and the performance characteristics of your system.  Start with relatively short timeouts and adjust as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Long-Running Calculations (High Severity):**  Malicious expressions could be designed to cause extremely long calculation times for `GetNext()` or `GetPrev()`, tying up resources. Timeouts prevent these calculations from running indefinitely.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Infinite Loops (High Severity):**  Certain expressions might lead to infinite loops when calculating future times.  The iteration limit prevents this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (Long-Running Calculations):** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS by limiting the execution time of date calculations. Risk reduced from high to low.
    *   **DoS (Infinite Loops):** Eliminates the risk of DoS due to infinite loops. Risk reduced from high to negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Timeouts are implemented for `cron.Parse()` calls in `api/schedule_task.go`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeouts are *not* consistently implemented for `GetNext()` and `GetPrev()` calls throughout the application.  Specifically, the `scheduler/worker.go` component, which handles the actual execution of scheduled tasks, does *not* use timeouts when calculating the next execution time.
    *   An iteration limit is *not* implemented anywhere in the code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling.md)

1.  **Check for Errors:** Always check the `error` return value from `cron.Parse()` and other `cron-expression` functions.
2.  **Log Detailed Errors:** Log any errors, including the input cron expression that caused the error, to a secure log file. This is crucial for debugging and identifying potential attacks.
3.  **Generic User Messages:**  Do *not* expose internal error messages or stack traces to the user.  Instead, return a generic error message, such as "Invalid input" or "An error occurred."
4. **Handle Timeouts:** When using contexts with timeouts, handle the `context.DeadlineExceeded` error appropriately. Log the timeout and return a suitable error message.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents sensitive information (e.g., internal code structure, library versions) from being leaked to attackers through error messages.
        *   **Debugging and Auditing (Low Severity):**  Proper error logging facilitates debugging and auditing, making it easier to identify and fix issues, including security vulnerabilities.

    * **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk of information disclosure. Risk reduced from medium to low.
        *   **Debugging and Auditing:** Improves the ability to debug and audit the application.

    * **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic error checking is performed for `cron.Parse()` in `api/schedule_task.go`.

    * **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Error handling is inconsistent throughout the application. Some functions do not check for errors or do not log them properly.
        *   Error messages returned to the user are sometimes too verbose and may reveal internal details.
        *   Timeout errors are not always handled explicitly.
