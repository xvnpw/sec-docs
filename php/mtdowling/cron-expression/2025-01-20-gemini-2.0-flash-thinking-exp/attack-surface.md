# Attack Surface Analysis for mtdowling/cron-expression

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Cron Strings Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_cron_strings_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted, overly complex cron expression that consumes excessive computational resources during parsing and validation by the `cron-expression` library.
*   **How `cron-expression` Contributes:** The library's core function is to parse and validate cron expressions. Inefficient parsing logic or lack of safeguards against overly complex expressions can lead to resource exhaustion.
*   **Example:**  A cron string like `*/1 * * * * ,*/1 * * * *,*/1 * * * *,*/1 * * * *,*/1 * * * *,*/1 * * * *,*/1 * * * *,*/1 * * * *,*/1 * * * *,*/1 * * * *` (repeatedly defining the same schedule) or an extremely long list of specific values (e.g., `1,2,3,4,5,...,1000 * * * *`) could overwhelm the parser.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown, temporary unavailability, or complete service disruption due to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input validation to limit the complexity of cron expressions (e.g., maximum number of comma-separated values, maximum length of the string).
    *   Set timeouts for the parsing and validation process to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
    *   Consider using a more robust or optimized cron expression parsing library if performance is a critical concern.
    *   Implement rate limiting on endpoints that accept cron expressions as input.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) within the Library](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__within_the_library.md)

*   **Description:** If the `cron-expression` library internally uses regular expressions for parsing, a specially crafted malicious cron string could trigger catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, leading to excessive CPU consumption.
*   **How `cron-expression` Contributes:** The library's internal implementation details, specifically the regular expressions used for parsing, can be vulnerable to ReDoS.
*   **Example:** A cron string with a repeating pattern that causes the regex engine to explore a large number of possibilities before failing to match or successfully matching. This is highly dependent on the specific regex used within the library.
*   **Impact:**  Severe performance degradation, application hang, or complete denial of service due to CPU exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Review the `cron-expression` library's source code to identify if regular expressions are used for parsing and if they are potentially vulnerable to ReDoS.
    *   If ReDoS vulnerabilities are suspected, consider patching the library or using an alternative library with more robust parsing logic.
    *   Implement input validation to restrict patterns that are known to cause ReDoS issues in similar regex implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Injection via Stored Cron Expressions](./attack_surfaces/injection_via_stored_cron_expressions.md)

*   **Description:** If cron expressions are stored in a database or configuration files and an attacker gains write access (through other vulnerabilities), they can inject malicious cron strings that are later processed by the `cron-expression` library.
*   **How `cron-expression` Contributes:** The library processes the cron strings retrieved from storage, regardless of their origin. If these strings are malicious, the library will contribute to the resulting attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a cron string into the database that, when parsed and executed, performs unauthorized actions or causes a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary commands (if the scheduled tasks allow it), data manipulation, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the application's functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls and input validation at the point where cron expressions are stored (e.g., database input sanitization, secure configuration file management).
    *   Regularly audit the stored cron expressions for any suspicious or unexpected entries.
    *   Apply the mitigation strategies mentioned above for malicious cron strings via direct input, as these injected strings will eventually be processed by the `cron-expression` library.
