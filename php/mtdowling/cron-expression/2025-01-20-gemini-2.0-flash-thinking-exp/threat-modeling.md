# Threat Model Analysis for mtdowling/cron-expression

## Threat: [Malicious Cron Expression Leading to Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./threats/malicious_cron_expression_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted cron expression designed to consume excessive CPU or memory resources *when parsed by the library*. This could involve overly complex expressions or those that generate a very large number of future execution times, directly impacting the library's processing.

**Impact:** The application's performance degrades significantly, potentially leading to unresponsiveness or complete failure due to the library's resource consumption. This impacts the availability of the application for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** `CronExpression::factory()` function (responsible for parsing the expression), internal parsing logic within the library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation to restrict the complexity and length of cron expressions *before* passing them to the library.
* Set timeouts for the cron expression parsing process *within the application* to prevent indefinite resource consumption by the library.
* Monitor resource usage during cron expression parsing and trigger alerts if thresholds are exceeded.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities in the Library](./threats/exploitation_of_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_the_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a malformed, overly long, or specially crafted cron expression that triggers a bug or vulnerability *within the `cron-expression` library's parsing logic*. This could lead to unexpected errors, crashes, or potentially even remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough. The attacker's success depends on the application passing untrusted input directly to the library.

**Impact:** Application instability, potential security breaches if the vulnerability allows for code execution or memory corruption *within the application's process due to the library's behavior*.

**Affected Component:** `CronExpression::factory()` function, internal parsing logic, regular expressions used for parsing *within the library*.

**Risk Severity:** High (if code execution is possible)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `cron-expression` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Implement input sanitization to remove potentially harmful characters or patterns before passing the expression to the library.
* Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the library or its usage.
* Implement robust error handling around the cron expression parsing process to prevent crashes from propagating.
