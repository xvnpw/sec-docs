## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the potential to leverage weaknesses in how the `cron-expression` library parses input. While direct Remote Code Execution within the parsing logic is less likely, it can lead to indirect RCE or Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Achieve Remote Code Execution (Indirect) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__achieve_remote_code_execution__indirect___critical_node_.md)

This node represents the high-impact scenario where an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the application's server, not directly through a vulnerability in the `cron-expression` library itself, but by exploiting how the application uses the parsed cron expression data.

    *   **Inject malicious payload within a valid cron expression:**
        *   An attacker crafts a cron expression that appears valid but contains a malicious payload within one of its fields.
    *   **Application interprets parsed data unsafely:**
        *   The application takes the parsed values from the cron expression and uses them in a way that allows for code injection.
    *   **Example: Application uses parsed values to construct system commands:**
        *   The application might use a parsed value (e.g., the minute value) to construct a system command without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject a malicious command within the cron expression that gets executed.
        *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Medium to High
        *   Skill Level: Medium to High
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Application Logic Flaws Related to Cron Expressions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_application_logic_flaws_related_to_cron_expressions__critical_node_.md)

This node represents vulnerabilities in how the application itself handles and manages cron expressions, beyond the parsing logic of the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Manipulate Scheduled Tasks (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/4__manipulate_scheduled_tasks__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the ability for an attacker to interfere with the application's scheduled tasks, either by creating new malicious tasks or modifying existing ones.

    *   **Inject malicious cron expression for task creation:**
        *   If the application allows users or external sources to define cron expressions for scheduled tasks, an attacker can inject a malicious expression that will execute attacker-controlled code at a specified time.
        *   Schedule execution of attacker-controlled code:
            *   The malicious cron expression triggers the execution of code defined by the attacker, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low to Medium
            *   Skill Level: Low to Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

    *   **Modify existing cron expressions:**
        *   An attacker gains access to the application's data store or configuration and alters existing cron expressions.
        *   Alter task execution timing or payload:
            *   By modifying the cron expression, the attacker can change when a task runs or alter the actions the task performs, potentially disrupting services or causing unintended consequences.
            *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
            *   Impact: Medium to High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
