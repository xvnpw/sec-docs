# Attack Surface Analysis for mtdowling/cron-expression

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Complex Cron Expression](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_complex_cron_expression.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an overly complex or deeply nested cron expression.

**How cron-expression contributes:** The library's parsing and evaluation logic must process the provided string. If the logic is not optimized or lacks safeguards, processing highly complex expressions can consume significant resources.

**Example:**  `*/1 * * * * , */1 * * * *, */1 * * * *, ... (repeated many times)` or expressions with many nested ranges and steps.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU or memory consumption on the server processing the cron expression.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement input validation to restrict the complexity of cron expressions (e.g., limit the number of comma-separated entries, the depth of ranges/steps).
*   Set timeouts for cron expression parsing and evaluation to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
*   Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory) for the process handling cron expression parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Potential Parser Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_potential_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Crafting a specific malformed cron string that triggers a vulnerability within the library's parsing engine itself (e.g., buffer overflow, integer overflow - though less likely in modern languages).

**How cron-expression contributes:** The core functionality of the library is to parse and interpret the cron string. Any flaw in this parsing logic is a direct vulnerability.

**Example:**  Providing a cron string with an extremely long sequence of a specific character or a carefully crafted sequence that exploits a parsing error.

**Impact:**  Potentially crashes the application, or in more severe (and less likely) scenarios, could lead to remote code execution if a critical vulnerability exists.

**Risk Severity:**  High (if a vulnerability exists).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `cron-expression` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories related to the library.
*   Consider using static analysis security testing (SAST) tools on the application code that uses the library.
