# Threat Model Analysis for mtdowling/cron-expression

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Cron Expression](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_cron_expression.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an extremely complex cron expression (e.g., using many ranges, lists, or step values in multiple fields) that causes the `cron-expression` library to consume excessive CPU time and memory during parsing or when calculating the next run time. The attacker might submit this malicious expression through a user interface, API endpoint, or by modifying configuration data if accessible.

**Impact:** The application's performance degrades significantly, potentially leading to denial of service for legitimate users. The server hosting the application might become unresponsive or crash.

**Affected Component:**
* `CronExpression::factory()`:  During the parsing of the cron string.
* `CronExpression::getNextRunDate()` / `CronExpression::getPreviousRunDate()`: When calculating future or past execution times.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation to restrict the complexity of cron expressions allowed. This could involve limiting the number of comma-separated values, the range of numerical values, or the usage of wildcard characters.
* Set timeouts for the parsing and next/previous run time calculation operations. If the operation exceeds the timeout, it should be terminated to prevent resource exhaustion.
* Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) associated with cron expression processing and alert on unusual spikes.
* Consider using a separate process or thread with resource limits for parsing and calculating cron expressions to isolate potential resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Input Validation Bypass due to Library Vulnerability](./threats/input_validation_bypass_due_to_library_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `cron-expression` library itself that allows for the creation of cron expressions that bypass intended input validation rules implemented by the application. This could occur if the library's parsing logic has flaws or inconsistencies. An attacker could exploit this to inject malicious or overly complex expressions despite application-level checks.

**Impact:**  The application's intended safeguards against malicious or problematic cron expressions are circumvented, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or logic manipulation.

**Affected Component:**
* The core parsing logic within the `CronExpression` class.

**Risk Severity:** High (if a vulnerability is actively exploited)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `cron-expression` library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor the library's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
* Implement robust input validation on the application side, but be aware that vulnerabilities in the underlying library might still pose a risk. Consider layering validation approaches.
* If concerns exist about the library's robustness, consider using alternative or more rigorously vetted cron expression parsing libraries.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attack (Specifically Targeting `cron-expression`)](./threats/dependency_confusionsupply_chain_attack__specifically_targeting__cron-expression__.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to introduce a malicious version of the `cron-expression` library with the same name into a public or private package repository that the application uses. If the application's dependency management is not properly configured, it could inadvertently download and use the compromised library.

**Impact:** The malicious library could contain arbitrary code that is executed within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other severe security incidents.

**Affected Component:** The entire `cron-expression` library as a dependency.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper dependency management practices, including using a package lock file (e.g., `composer.lock` for PHP) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
* Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies using checksums or signatures if available.
* Use a private package repository or artifact manager to control and vet the dependencies used within the organization.
* Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or similar software composition analysis tools.
