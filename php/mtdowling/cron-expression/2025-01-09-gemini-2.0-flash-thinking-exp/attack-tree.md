## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Supply Malicious Cron Expression](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_supply_malicious_cron_expression.md)

This represents the overarching strategy of introducing a harmful cron expression into the application.

*   **Directly Input Malicious Cron Expression:**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit API Endpoint Vulnerability (to inject malicious expression):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the application's API endpoints to bypass security controls and inject a malicious cron expression. This could involve flaws in authentication, authorization, or input validation on API endpoints that accept or process cron expressions.
        *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary tasks at attacker-defined times, potentially causing significant disruptions, data manipulation, or even complete system takeover depending on the application's functionality.

*   **Indirectly Supply Malicious Cron Expression:**
    This involves compromising the storage mechanisms of cron expressions.
    *   **Critical Path: Compromise Data Source Containing Cron Expressions (e.g., database):**
        *   **Critical Node: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries that handle cron expressions. This allows them to bypass normal security measures and directly manipulate the database, including modifying existing cron expressions or inserting new, malicious ones.
            *   **Impact:**  Full database access, leading to the potential for data breaches, data corruption, and the ability to schedule arbitrary tasks with the application's privileges.
        *   **Critical Node: Exploit Weak Database Credentials:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers obtain valid but weak or default database credentials through various means (e.g., social engineering, brute-force attacks, information leaks). These credentials allow direct access to the database.
            *   **Impact:**  Similar to SQL injection, this grants full database access, enabling the attacker to manipulate cron expressions and other data.
        *   **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Database Access Controls:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The application's database access controls are misconfigured, granting excessive privileges to users or applications that should not have direct access to the cron expression data.
            *   **Impact:**  Allows unauthorized modification of cron expressions, potentially leading to unintended application behavior.
        *   **Compromise Configuration File Containing Cron Expressions:**
            *   **Critical Node: Exploit File Inclusion Vulnerability:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that allow them to include arbitrary files into the application's execution context. If configuration files containing cron expressions are targeted, attackers can inject malicious content or overwrite the existing configurations.
                *   **Impact:**  Can lead to the execution of arbitrary code if the included file is crafted maliciously, or the ability to manipulate cron schedules for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Weaknesses in Cron Expression Parsing/Validation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_weaknesses_in_cron_expression_parsingvalidation.md)

This involves leveraging flaws in how the library processes cron expressions.

*   **Cause Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Buffer Overflow (Less Likely, but possible in native implementations):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted, overly long, or malformed cron expression is provided as input, exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in the underlying parsing logic (more likely in native implementations of cron parsers).
        *   **Impact:** Can lead to application crashes, memory corruption, and potentially even code execution in vulnerable scenarios.

*   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (Highly Unlikely with this specific library):**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerability in the Parsing Logic Leading to Code Injection (e.g., through specially crafted characters):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** A highly sophisticated attack where a carefully crafted cron expression exploits a vulnerability in the parsing logic to inject and execute arbitrary code within the application's context. This is generally very difficult to achieve in well-designed parsing libraries.
        *   **Impact:** If successful, this results in complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
