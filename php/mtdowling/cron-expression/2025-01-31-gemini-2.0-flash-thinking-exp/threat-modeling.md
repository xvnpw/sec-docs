# Threat Model Analysis for mtdowling/cron-expression

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Complex Cron Expressions](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_complex_cron_expressions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and provides an extremely complex cron expression. When the `cron-expression` library attempts to parse or evaluate this expression, it consumes excessive CPU and memory resources. This can lead to application slowdown or complete service unavailability. The attacker exploits the library's resource consumption during parsing or evaluation of complex expressions.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion. Service outage and inability to process scheduled tasks.
*   **Affected Component:** Parsing and Evaluation modules within the `cron-expression` library. Specifically, functions handling complex ranges, wildcards, and time calculations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input validation *before* passing cron expressions to the library.  Restrict the allowed complexity of cron expressions based on application needs. This could involve limiting the number of wildcards, ranges, or the overall length of the expression string.
    *   Set timeouts specifically for the `cron-expression` library's parsing and `isDue()` evaluation functions to prevent unbounded processing.
    *   Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement alerts to detect unusual spikes that might indicate a DoS attack via complex cron expressions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Algorithmic Complexity Exploits](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_algorithmic_complexity_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies specific cron expressions that trigger inefficient algorithms within the `cron-expression` library. These expressions cause the library to perform computationally expensive operations, leading to prolonged processing times and DoS. The attacker leverages algorithmic weaknesses in the library's code.
*   **Impact:** Application performance severely degrades or becomes unavailable. Scheduled tasks are delayed or not processed at all.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific algorithms within the `cron-expression` library's core logic, particularly in parsing, time calculation, and next-run-time determination functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Conduct a thorough code review of the `mtdowling/cron-expression` library to identify and address potential algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities. Focus on areas handling complex cron syntax and edge cases.
    *   Perform fuzz testing and performance testing of the library with a wide range of cron expressions, including crafted inputs designed to trigger worst-case algorithmic behavior.
    *   Update to the latest version of the `mtdowling/cron-expression` library, as maintainers may have addressed performance issues or algorithmic vulnerabilities in newer releases.
    *   Implement timeouts for library operations as a general safeguard against unexpected delays caused by algorithmic issues.

## Threat: [Incorrect Scheduling due to Parsing Errors or Ambiguities](./threats/incorrect_scheduling_due_to_parsing_errors_or_ambiguities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or ambiguities in the `cron-expression` library's parsing logic can lead to misinterpretation of valid cron expressions. This results in tasks being scheduled and executed at incorrect times, deviating from the intended schedule defined by the cron expression. The vulnerability lies in the library's parsing implementation.
*   **Impact:** Critical scheduled tasks may not run as intended, leading to functional failures, data inconsistencies, or security breaches if scheduling is security-critical.
*   **Affected Component:** Parsing module of the `cron-expression` library, specifically the code responsible for interpreting cron expression syntax and converting it into a schedule.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous unit and integration tests specifically targeting the `cron-expression` library's parsing functionality. Test with a comprehensive suite of valid, edge-case, and potentially ambiguous cron expressions to ensure accurate interpretation.
    *   Thoroughly validate the scheduled times generated by the library in test environments before deploying to production. Compare the library's output against expected schedules.
    *   If possible, contribute to the `mtdowling/cron-expression` project by reporting and providing fixes for any parsing errors or ambiguities discovered.
    *   Consider using alternative, well-vetted cron expression libraries if scheduling accuracy and reliability are paramount for security-critical operations.

## Threat: [Time Zone Handling Vulnerabilities leading to Incorrect Execution Timing](./threats/time_zone_handling_vulnerabilities_leading_to_incorrect_execution_timing.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the `cron-expression` library's time zone handling logic can cause incorrect calculation of scheduled times when time zones are involved. This can lead to tasks running at unintended times if the library does not correctly account for time zone conversions or daylight saving time. The vulnerability resides in the library's time zone calculation and conversion logic.
*   **Impact:** Time-sensitive tasks are executed at wrong times, potentially causing functional errors, missed deadlines, or security vulnerabilities if time-based access control or operations are affected.
*   **Affected Component:** Time zone handling logic within the `cron-expression` library, if it performs time zone conversions or calculations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   If the application requires time zone support, thoroughly test the `cron-expression` library's time zone handling capabilities, especially around time zone transitions (Daylight Saving Time) and across different time zones.
    *   Explicitly specify and consistently handle time zones within the application and when using the `cron-expression` library. Ensure clarity on which time zone the cron expressions are interpreted in.
    *   If possible, use UTC time internally within the application and for cron expressions to minimize time zone ambiguity and potential errors. Convert to local time zones only for display or user interaction.
    *   Review the `mtdowling/cron-expression` library's documentation and source code related to time zone handling to understand its capabilities and limitations. Report and contribute fixes for any time zone related bugs discovered.
