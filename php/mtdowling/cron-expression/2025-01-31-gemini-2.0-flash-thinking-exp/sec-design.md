# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a PHP library for parsing and describing cron expressions. It enables developers to easily work with cron expressions in their PHP applications, allowing for task scheduling and automation.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a reliable and accurate cron expression parsing and evaluation library for PHP developers.
- Simplify the process of working with cron expressions in PHP applications.
- Offer a well-documented and easy-to-use library to enhance developer productivity.
- Ensure the library is performant and does not introduce significant overhead to applications using it.

Business Risks:
- Incorrect cron expression parsing could lead to tasks being executed at the wrong time or not at all, disrupting business processes that rely on scheduled tasks.
- Performance issues in the library could negatively impact the performance of applications using it, especially if cron expressions are evaluated frequently.
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited if an attacker can control the cron expression input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or information disclosure in the applications using the library.
- Lack of maintenance and updates could lead to compatibility issues with newer PHP versions or unpatched security vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Standard PHP security practices are assumed for the development and execution environment of applications using this library.
- security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, benefiting from GitHub's infrastructure security.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Dependency on a third-party library introduces a potential supply chain risk. Vulnerabilities in the library could affect applications using it.
- accepted risk: Security of applications using this library is the responsibility of the application developers. This library itself does not enforce security policies on its users.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement dependency scanning in the build process to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in the library and its dependencies (if any).
- security control: Encourage users to perform input validation on cron expressions before passing them to the library to prevent unexpected behavior due to malformed input.
- security control: Establish a process for monitoring and updating the library to address any reported security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to this library as it is a passive component. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using this library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to this library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using this library to control how and where cron expressions are used.
- Input Validation: The library should handle invalid cron expressions gracefully and predictably, preventing unexpected errors or crashes. It should validate the format of the input cron expression to avoid potential issues.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for this library's functionality. However, if cron expressions are stored or transmitted, standard security practices for data at rest and in transit should be applied by the applications using this library.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Process:
- Task Scheduling: The primary business process at risk is the reliable execution of scheduled tasks in applications that depend on this library. Incorrect or failed task scheduling can disrupt business operations, data processing, and automated workflows.

Data Sensitivity:
- Cron Expressions: Cron expressions themselves are generally not considered highly sensitive data. However, they can reveal information about scheduled processes and potentially system configurations.
- Application Logic related to Scheduled Tasks: The application code that uses this library and handles the execution of scheduled tasks might process sensitive data. The security of this data depends on the overall application security, not directly on the library itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Assumption: The library is intended for use in business applications where reliable task scheduling is important.
- Question: What is the expected scale and performance requirements for applications using this library?

SECURITY POSTURE:
- Assumption: Users of this library are expected to implement their own application-level security controls.
- Question: Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) that applications using this library might need to adhere to?

DESIGN:
- Assumption: The library will be primarily used in standard PHP environments (web servers, CLI applications).
- Question: Are there any specific deployment environments or architectures that the library needs to be compatible with (e.g., serverless environments, containerized deployments)?
