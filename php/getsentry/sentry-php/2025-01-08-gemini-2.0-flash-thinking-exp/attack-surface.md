# Attack Surface Analysis for getsentry/sentry-php

## Attack Surface: [Exposed DSN (Data Source Name)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_dsn__data_source_name_.md)

**Description:** The DSN contains sensitive information required for authentication with your Sentry project. If exposed, attackers can send arbitrary data to your Sentry instance.

**How Sentry-PHP Contributes:** `sentry-php` requires the DSN to be configured for it to function and transmits data using this DSN. The security of the DSN is paramount for the library's secure operation.

**Example:** A developer hardcodes the DSN directly into a publicly accessible PHP file or includes it in client-side JavaScript configuration used by `sentry-php`'s browser integration.

**Impact:**
*   Data pollution in your Sentry project, making it harder to identify genuine errors and potentially leading to missed critical issues.
*   Resource exhaustion on your Sentry project, potentially incurring unexpected costs or service disruption.
*   Possibility of attackers inferring information about your application by observing how their injected data is processed and displayed in Sentry.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store the DSN securely using environment variables or secure configuration management systems.
*   Avoid hardcoding the DSN in your application code.
*   Restrict access to configuration files containing the DSN.
*   If using client-side integrations, be extremely cautious about exposing the DSN and consider alternative authentication methods if available.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Logged Data](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_logged_data.md)

**Description:** User-controlled input that is not properly sanitized before being included in error messages or context data sent via `sentry-php` can be manipulated by attackers.

**How Sentry-PHP Contributes:** `sentry-php` provides the functionality to send custom data (messages, user context, extras) to Sentry. If developers pass unsanitized user input to these functions, it creates an injection point.

**Example:** An attacker provides a malicious string containing JavaScript code as their username, and this username is included in the user context sent to Sentry during an error using `sentry-php`. If Sentry's UI doesn't properly sanitize this, it could lead to XSS for users viewing the error.

**Impact:**
*   Log poisoning: Injecting misleading or false information into your Sentry logs, potentially obscuring real issues or framing others.
*   Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the Sentry UI, impacting users viewing error reports.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize all user-provided input before including it in messages, user context, tags, or extra data sent to Sentry using `sentry-php`'s functions.
*   Be mindful of the data being logged and avoid including sensitive information unnecessarily.
*   Review Sentry's documentation for any specific recommendations on data sanitization and encoding.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exfiltration via Error Messages](./attack_surfaces/data_exfiltration_via_error_messages.md)

**Description:** Error messages or context data sent to Sentry using `sentry-php` might inadvertently contain sensitive information.

**How Sentry-PHP Contributes:** `sentry-php` is the direct mechanism through which these error details are packaged and transmitted to the external Sentry service.

**Example:** An exception handler catches a database error that includes the database connection string (containing credentials) and this is sent to Sentry via `sentry-php`.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (credentials, API keys, personal data, internal application details) to anyone with access to the Sentry project.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review the data being sent to Sentry using `sentry-php` and avoid logging sensitive information.
*   Implement robust error handling to prevent sensitive details from being included in error messages before they are passed to `sentry-php`.
*   Use techniques like scrubbing sensitive data before sending it to Sentry (though this should be a last resort, better to avoid logging it in the first place).
*   Restrict access to your Sentry project to authorized personnel.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Sentry-PHP Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_sentry-php_library_itself.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities within the `sentry-php` library's code can be exploited by attackers.

**How Sentry-PHP Contributes:** As a software library directly integrated into the application, any vulnerability in `sentry-php`'s code can be a direct entry point for attacks.

**Example:** A known security vulnerability exists in an older version of `sentry-php` that allows for remote code execution if a specific type of crafted error is triggered and processed by the library.

**Impact:** Can range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution on the server running the application, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `sentry-php` updated to the latest stable version.
*   Regularly review the security advisories for `sentry-php` to be aware of and patch any known vulnerabilities.
*   Follow security best practices for dependency management and promptly apply security updates.
