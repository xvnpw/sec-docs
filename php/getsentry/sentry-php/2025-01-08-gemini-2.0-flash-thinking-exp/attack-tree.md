## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sentry PHP Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sentry_php_configuration.md)

**High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Sentry PHP Configuration -> Expose Sensitive Credentials -> Utilize Exposed Credentials -> Impersonate Application to Sentry**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access Sentry DSN/Auth Token (Critical Node):**
        *   Reading DSN/Auth Token from insecurely stored configuration files (e.g., world-readable files, hardcoded values).
        *   Reading DSN/Auth Token from exposed environment variables (e.g., accidentally committed to version control, exposed via server misconfiguration).
        *   Intercepting network traffic (if HTTPS is not enforced) during initial setup or reconfiguration.
    *   **Utilize Exposed Credentials (Critical Node):**
        *   Using the compromised DSN/Auth Token to directly send malicious payloads to the Sentry project, impersonating the legitimate application.
        *   Manipulating error reports to inject false information, cover up malicious activity, or cause confusion.
        *   Potentially gaining unauthorized access to the Sentry project's settings and data.
    *   **Impersonate Application to Sentry (Critical Node):**
        *   Successfully sending crafted error reports or events to the Sentry server using the stolen credentials.
        *   This allows the attacker to control the data being logged, potentially injecting malicious scripts (if the Sentry UI is vulnerable) or exfiltrating data via custom error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_credentials.md)

**High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting Sentry PHP Configuration -> Expose Sensitive Credentials -> Utilize Exposed Credentials -> Potentially Access Other Projects**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access Sentry DSN/Auth Token (Critical Node):** (Same as High-Risk Path 1)
    *   **Utilize Exposed Credentials (Critical Node):** (Same as High-Risk Path 1)
    *   **Potentially Access Other Projects:**
        *   If the compromised credentials belong to a Sentry user with access to multiple projects within the same organization, the attacker could pivot and gain access to those projects as well.
        *   This allows for a broader compromise, potentially affecting multiple applications and data sets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Point Sentry Configuration to a Malicious Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/point_sentry_configuration_to_a_malicious_endpoint.md)

**High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Sentry PHP Configuration -> Gain Control Over Configuration -> Redirect Error Data to Attacker-Controlled Server -> Capture Sensitive Data Sent in Error Reports**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Gain Control Over Configuration (Critical Node):**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's configuration management system to modify the Sentry DSN or endpoint.
        *   Compromising the server hosting the application to directly modify configuration files.
    *   **Redirect Error Data to Attacker-Controlled Server:**
        *   Successfully changing the Sentry DSN in the application's configuration to point to a server controlled by the attacker.
        *   This redirects all error reports to the attacker's server.
    *   **Capture Sensitive Data Sent in Error Reports (Critical Node):**
        *   The attacker's server receives all error reports generated by the application, potentially containing sensitive information like user data, API keys, internal paths, and more.
        *   This allows for direct exfiltration of sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Publicly Known Exploits](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_publicly_known_exploits.md)

**High-Risk Path 4: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Sentry PHP Library -> Leverage Publicly Known Exploits**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Leverage Publicly Known Exploits:**
        *   If the application is using a vulnerable version of the `getsentry/sentry-php` library, attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities.
        *   These vulnerabilities could range from remote code execution to information disclosure, depending on the specific flaw.
        *   Exploitation often involves sending specially crafted requests or data that triggers the vulnerability in the Sentry PHP library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Sentry PHP](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_sentry_php.md)

The ultimate goal, representing a complete security breach facilitated by the Sentry integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_credentials.md)

A critical point of failure. If credentials are leaked, multiple high-risk paths become viable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sentry DSN/Auth Token](./attack_tree_paths/access_sentry_dsnauth_token.md)

The initial step in credential compromise, making it a crucial target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Exposed Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_exposed_credentials.md)

The action of leveraging stolen credentials to perform malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Impersonate Application to Sentry](./attack_tree_paths/impersonate_application_to_sentry.md)

Allows attackers to manipulate error reporting and potentially inject malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Control Over Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_over_configuration.md)

Grants attackers the ability to redirect error data and potentially other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Capture Sensitive Data Sent in Error Reports](./attack_tree_paths/capture_sensitive_data_sent_in_error_reports.md)

The direct result of redirecting error data, leading to information theft.
