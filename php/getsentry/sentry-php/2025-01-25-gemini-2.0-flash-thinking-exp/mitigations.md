## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Data Scrubbing and Masking](./mitigation_strategies/implement_data_scrubbing_and_masking.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Data Scrubbing and Masking

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:**  Conduct a thorough review of your application code and data flow to pinpoint all locations where sensitive information might be present in variables, request parameters, session data, or database queries that could be captured by Sentry PHP.
    2.  **Configure `before_send` or `before_send_transaction` in Sentry PHP:** In your Sentry PHP configuration file (e.g., `config/sentry.php`), define the `before_send` or `before_send_transaction` options as PHP functions. These functions are specific to `sentry-php` and allow you to intercept and modify event data before it's sent to Sentry.
    3.  **Implement Scrubbing Logic within `before_send`:** Inside these functions, write PHP code to inspect the `$event` object (which represents the error or transaction data).
        *   Use conditional statements and array/object manipulation to check for sensitive data within the event's context (user context, request data, etc.).
        *   Employ PHP's string manipulation functions or regular expressions to identify and redact sensitive data within string values.
        *   Replace sensitive values with placeholders like `"[REDACTED]"` or generic descriptions directly within the `$event` object.
        *   Example using `before_send` in `config/sentry.php`:

            ```php
            'before_send' => function (\Sentry\Event $event): ?\Sentry\Event {
                $userContext = $event->getUserContext();
                if (isset($userContext['email'])) {
                    $userContext['email'] = '[REDACTED EMAIL]';
                    $event->setUserContext($userContext);
                }
                $requestData = $event->getRequestData();
                if (isset($requestData['query'])) {
                    // Example: Redact API key parameter
                    if (isset($requestData['query']['api_key'])) {
                        $requestData['query']['api_key'] = '[REDACTED API KEY]';
                        $event->setRequestData($requestData);
                    }
                }
                return $event;
            },
            ```
        4.  **Test Scrubbing:** Thoroughly test your scrubbing logic by triggering various errors and transactions in your application and then inspecting the events in your Sentry dashboard. Verify that sensitive information is effectively redacted as configured in your `before_send` function.
        5.  **Maintain and Update Scrubbing Rules:** Regularly review and update your scrubbing rules in `before_send` as your application evolves and new types of sensitive data are introduced or data handling practices change.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure/Sensitive Information Leaks (High Severity):** Accidental transmission of PII, secrets, or confidential data to Sentry via `sentry-php`, potentially exposing it to unauthorized individuals or systems.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium to High Severity):** Failure to comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) due to logging sensitive data in Sentry through `sentry-php`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure/Sensitive Information Leaks:** Risk reduced to **Low**. Effective scrubbing within `sentry-php` minimizes the chance of sensitive data reaching Sentry.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk reduced to **Low**. Scrubbing in `sentry-php` helps ensure compliance by preventing the logging of regulated data.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partial:** Basic scrubbing for user email and IP addresses is implemented in the `before_send` function within `config/sentry.php`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More comprehensive scrubbing rules are needed within `before_send` to cover request parameters, form data, and database query parameters captured by `sentry-php`.
    *   No scrubbing is currently implemented for transaction data captured by `sentry-php`.
    *   Regular review and updates of scrubbing rules in `before_send` are not yet a formalized process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Data Sampling](./mitigation_strategies/control_data_sampling.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Control Data Sampling

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Error Volume:** Analyze the volume of errors and transactions your application generates that are being captured and sent to Sentry via `sentry-php`.
    2.  **Configure `sample_rate` and `traces_sample_rate` in Sentry PHP:** In your Sentry PHP configuration file (`config/sentry.php`), adjust the `sample_rate` option (for error events) and `traces_sample_rate` option (for transaction events). These `sentry-php` options control the percentage of events sent to Sentry.
        *   `sample_rate`:  Set this `sentry-php` option to a value between 0.0 and 1.0 to sample error events. For example, `0.7` will send 70% of errors.
        *   `traces_sample_rate`: Set this `sentry-php` option similarly to sample transaction events. For example, `0.2` will send 20% of transactions.
        *   Example configuration in `config/sentry.php`:

            ```php
            'options' => [
                'sample_rate' => 0.7,
                'traces_sample_rate' => 0.2,
            ],
            ```
    3.  **Optimize Sampling Rates:** Experiment with different sampling rates in your `sentry-php` configuration to find a balance between reducing data volume sent to Sentry and maintaining sufficient error coverage for effective monitoring and debugging.
    4.  **Conditional Sampling within `before_send` (Advanced):** For more granular control, you can implement conditional sampling logic within the `before_send` function in `sentry-php`. This allows you to dynamically decide whether to sample an event based on its properties or severity, offering more flexibility than the global `sample_rate`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure/Sensitive Information Leaks (Medium Severity):** Reduces the overall probability of accidentally capturing sensitive data by decreasing the total number of events sent to Sentry via `sentry-php`.
    *   **Sentry Project Overload/Cost (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the volume of data sent to Sentry by `sentry-php`, potentially lowering costs and preventing performance issues in your Sentry project due to excessive data ingestion from your application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure/Sensitive Information Leaks:** Risk reduced to **Medium**. While scrubbing is more direct, sampling via `sentry-php` provides an additional layer of defense by reducing the data volume.
    *   **Sentry Project Overload/Cost:** Risk reduced to **Low**. Sampling configured in `sentry-php` directly addresses data volume concerns.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **No:** Data sampling is not currently configured in the `sentry-php` project configuration. All errors and transactions are being sent to Sentry.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `sample_rate` and `traces_sample_rate` options need to be configured within the `options` array in `config/sentry.php`.
    *   Optimal sampling rates need to be determined based on application error volume and monitoring needs for `sentry-php` integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Filter Sensitive Context Data](./mitigation_strategies/filter_sensitive_context_data.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Filter Sensitive Context Data

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Context Data Capture by Sentry PHP:** Understand what context data `sentry-php` automatically captures by default (request headers, user context, environment variables, etc.). Refer to the Sentry PHP documentation for the default integrations and data capture.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Context:** Determine which parts of the automatically captured context data by `sentry-php` might contain sensitive information in your application's context.
    3.  **Configure `options['default_integrations']` and `options['integrations']` in Sentry PHP:** Use the `options` array in your Sentry PHP configuration (`config/sentry.php`) to customize integrations and filter context data captured by `sentry-php`.
        *   To remove default integrations in `sentry-php` that might capture sensitive data, set `default_integrations` to `false` and then explicitly list only the integrations you want to enable in the `integrations` array.
        *   To customize or disable specific context data capture *within* integrations provided by `sentry-php`, configure the `integrations` option, modifying the settings of specific integration classes.
        *   Example in `config/sentry.php` to disable request body capture by `sentry-php`:

            ```php
            'options' => [
                'default_integrations' => false,
                'integrations' => [
                    new \Sentry\Integration\ExceptionListenerIntegration(),
                    new \Sentry\Integration\FrameContextIntegration(),
                    new \Sentry\Integration\RequestIntegration([
                        'body_parsers' => [], // Disable body parsing in RequestIntegration
                    ]),
                    // ... other integrations you want to keep from sentry-php
                ],
            ],
            ```
    4.  **Whitelist Safe Context Data:** Instead of blacklisting context data in `sentry-php`, consider whitelisting only the necessary context data you need for debugging and monitoring by selectively enabling integrations and their options.
    5.  **Test Configuration:** Verify that your context data filtering in `sentry-php` is working as expected by inspecting Sentry events and ensuring sensitive context information is not being captured.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure/Sensitive Information Leaks (Medium Severity):** Prevents the automatic capture of sensitive data by `sentry-php` that might be present in request headers, bodies, or other context information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure/Sensitive Information Leaks:** Risk reduced to **Medium**.  Filtering context data captured by `sentry-php` reduces the attack surface by limiting the types of data automatically collected.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **No:** Default context data capture settings of `sentry-php` are currently in use. No explicit filtering is configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configuration of `options['default_integrations']` and `options['integrations']` in `config/sentry.php` to filter sensitive context data captured by `sentry-php`.
    *   Review of default integrations and context data capture by `sentry-php` to identify and disable potentially problematic features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Manage Sentry DSN (Data Source Name)](./mitigation_strategies/securely_manage_sentry_dsn__data_source_name_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Securely Manage Sentry DSN (Data Source Name)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment Variables for Sentry DSN:** Store the Sentry DSN used by `sentry-php` as an environment variable (e.g., `SENTRY_DSN`). This is the recommended way to configure the DSN for `sentry-php`.
    2.  **Configuration Files (Environment-Specific):** Load the DSN for `sentry-php` from environment-specific configuration files (like `.env` files or environment-specific PHP configuration arrays) that are not committed to version control.  `sentry-php` configuration typically reads from your application's configuration system.
    3.  **Secure Configuration Management (Advanced):** For more secure and complex deployments, use a secure configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage the DSN that is then accessed by your application and used to configure `sentry-php`.
    4.  **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the environment where the DSN used by `sentry-php` is stored to only authorized personnel and systems.
    5.  **Avoid Hardcoding DSN in Sentry PHP Configuration:**  **Never** hardcode the DSN directly into your `sentry-php` configuration file (`config/sentry.php`) or commit it to version control.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sentry DSN (High Severity):**  Accidental exposure of the DSN used by `sentry-php` in version control, public repositories, or application logs. This could allow unauthorized individuals to send events to your Sentry project via `sentry-php`, potentially leading to data injection, spam, or abuse of your Sentry account.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sentry DSN:** Risk reduced to **Low**. Secure DSN management for `sentry-php` prevents unauthorized access and misuse.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Yes:** The Sentry DSN used by `sentry-php` is loaded from an environment variable (`SENTRY_DSN`) in `config/sentry.php`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation in terms of DSN storage for `sentry-php`. However, regular review of environment access controls is needed to ensure ongoing security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Sentry Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/validate_sentry_configuration.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Validate Sentry Configuration

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration Schema (Optional):** While not strictly required, you could define a schema or validation rules for your Sentry PHP configuration (`config/sentry.php`) to ensure options are set correctly.
    2.  **Validation on Startup/Deployment:** Implement validation checks within your application's startup or deployment processes to verify the `sentry-php` configuration.
    3.  **Verify Critical Sentry PHP Options:**  Specifically validate critical `sentry-php` options such as:
        *   DSN: Ensure the DSN configured for `sentry-php` is a valid DSN format and is not empty.
        *   Environment: Verify the `environment` option in `sentry-php` is set to an expected environment name (e.g., "production", "staging").
        *   Release: Confirm the `release` option in `sentry-php` is correctly set if you are using release tracking.
    4.  **Error Handling for Invalid Configuration:**  If validation of the `sentry-php` configuration fails, log an error and prevent the application from starting or deploying with an invalid Sentry setup. This ensures `sentry-php` is properly configured.
    5.  **Automated Validation in CI/CD:** Integrate configuration validation into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent validation of the `sentry-php` configuration across different environments.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Leading to Data Leakage (Medium Severity):**  Incorrectly configured DSN or other `sentry-php` options could lead to events being sent to the wrong Sentry project or data being logged in unintended ways via `sentry-php`, potentially causing data leakage or incorrect error reporting.
    *   **Service Disruption (Low to Medium Severity):**  Misconfiguration of `sentry-php` could prevent it from functioning correctly, leading to missed error reports and hindering debugging efforts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Leading to Data Leakage:** Risk reduced to **Low**. Validation of `sentry-php` configuration helps prevent misconfigurations that could lead to data leakage.
    *   **Service Disruption:** Risk reduced to **Low**. Validation ensures `sentry-php` is configured correctly for reliable error reporting.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **No:** No explicit Sentry configuration validation is currently implemented for `sentry-php`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of configuration validation logic in the application startup process (e.g., within a service provider or bootstrap file) to check `sentry-php` options.
    *   Definition of a configuration schema or validation rules for `sentry-php` options (optional but recommended).
    *   Integration of validation into the CI/CD pipeline for `sentry-php` configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `sentry-php` and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__sentry-php__and_dependencies.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Update `sentry-php` and Dependencies

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management with Composer:** Use Composer (or your project's dependency manager) to manage the `sentry-php` library and its dependencies.
    2.  **Stay Updated with Sentry PHP Releases:** Regularly check for updates to the `getsentry/sentry-php` library. Monitor release notes and security advisories from the Sentry PHP project for new versions and security patches.
    3.  **Update Process for Sentry PHP:** Implement a process for updating `sentry-php` and its dependencies, including testing after updates to ensure compatibility with your application and the continued proper functioning of `sentry-php`.
    4.  **Automated Updates (Consideration):** Explore using automated dependency update tools (e.g., Dependabot, Renovate) specifically for `sentry-php` and its dependencies to streamline the update process and receive notifications about new versions, including security updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `sentry-php` or its Dependencies (High Severity):**  Outdated versions of `sentry-php` or its dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Updating `sentry-php` and its dependencies patches these vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `sentry-php` or its Dependencies:** Risk reduced to **Low**. Regular updates of `sentry-php` ensure you benefit from security fixes and reduce the attack surface related to the error tracking library.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partial:** Dependencies, including `sentry-php`, are generally updated periodically, but no formal process or schedule is in place for regularly checking and updating `sentry-php` and its dependencies specifically for security updates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a formal process for regularly checking and updating `sentry-php` and its dependencies, prioritizing security updates released for `sentry-php` and its ecosystem.
    *   Consider implementing automated dependency update tools specifically for managing `sentry-php` and its related packages.
