# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for getsentry/sentry-php

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Scrubbing using `before_send` and `before_breadcrumb` in `sentry-php`](./mitigation_strategies/data_scrubbing_using__before_send__and__before_breadcrumb__in__sentry-php_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Developers must pinpoint sensitive data types that might be captured by `sentry-php` in application variables, request parameters, user inputs, and error messages.
    2.  **Implement `before_send` function in `sentry.php`:**  Within your `sentry.php` configuration file, define the `before_send` option as a function. This function will be executed by `sentry-php` before each error event is transmitted to Sentry.
    3.  **Implement `before_breadcrumb` function in `sentry.php`:** Similarly, define the `before_breadcrumb` option in `sentry.php` as a function to process breadcrumbs generated by `sentry-php` before sending.
    4.  **Redact Sensitive Data within `before_send` and `before_breadcrumb`:** Inside these functions, use PHP code to inspect the event data (in `before_send`) and breadcrumb data (in `before_breadcrumb`) provided by `sentry-php`. Employ string manipulation, regular expressions, or dedicated libraries within these functions to redact or remove identified sensitive data *before* `sentry-php` sends it.
    5.  **Test Scrubbing Rules with `sentry-php`:** Thoroughly test your scrubbing rules to ensure they function correctly within the `sentry-php` integration and effectively redact sensitive information without removing crucial debugging details.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Update `sentry-php` Scrubbing:** Periodically review and update your scrubbing rules in `sentry.php` as your application evolves and new sensitive data types emerge that `sentry-php` might capture.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Sentry Dashboard via `sentry-php`:** Severity: High.  `sentry-php` might inadvertently send sensitive data to Sentry, which could be exposed if the Sentry dashboard is compromised or accessed by unauthorized users.
        *   **Accidental Data Leaks through `sentry-php`:** Severity: Medium. Developers using `sentry-php` might unintentionally configure it to capture and send sensitive data without realizing the security implications.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Sentry Dashboard via `sentry-php`:** Impact: High.  Effective scrubbing in `sentry-php` significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data being sent and exposed via Sentry.
        *   **Accidental Data Leaks through `sentry-php`:** Impact: High. Proactive scrubbing within `sentry-php` minimizes the chance of accidental data leaks through the error reporting system.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - `before_send` is implemented in `config/sentry.php` to redact basic PII.
        *   Location: `config/sentry.php`
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `before_breadcrumb` is not fully utilized in `config/sentry.php` to scrub breadcrumb data.
        *   Scrubbing rules in `sentry.php` need expansion for application-specific sensitive data and regular updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Context Data and Limit Breadcrumb Data Configuration in `sentry.php`](./mitigation_strategies/control_context_data_and_limit_breadcrumb_data_configuration_in__sentry_php_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Context Data Usage with `sentry-php`:** Audit where context data (user context, tags, extra data) is added to Sentry events *via `sentry-php` calls* in your codebase.
    2.  **Minimize Context Data Sent by `sentry-php`:** Reduce unnecessary context data added through `sentry-php` that doesn't directly aid debugging.
    3.  **Sanitize Context Data Before Passing to `sentry-php`:** Sanitize context data in your application code *before* passing it to `sentry-php` functions to ensure no sensitive information is included.
    4.  **Review Default Breadcrumbs in `sentry.php` Configuration:** Examine the default breadcrumb capture settings in your `sentry.php` configuration (e.g., `breadcrumbs.monolog`, `breadcrumbs.sql_queries`, `breadcrumbs.http_client`).
    5.  **Disable Unnecessary Breadcrumbs in `sentry.php`:** Disable breadcrumb capture in `sentry.php` for categories that are not essential or likely to contain sensitive data.
    6.  **Customize Breadcrumb Capture in `sentry.php`:** If certain breadcrumb types are needed but might contain sensitive data, customize their capture in `sentry.php` to exclude sensitive parts (e.g., exclude query parameters from HTTP request breadcrumbs via configuration).
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure via Context and Breadcrumbs through `sentry-php`:** Severity: Medium. `sentry-php`'s context and breadcrumb features, if not configured carefully, can inadvertently capture and send sensitive data.
        *   **Information Overload in Sentry due to `sentry-php`:** Severity: Low. Excessive context and breadcrumbs sent by `sentry-php` can make error analysis in Sentry less efficient.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure via Context and Breadcrumbs through `sentry-php`:** Impact: Medium. Controlling context and breadcrumbs in `sentry-php` reduces the potential for data leaks through these features.
        *   **Information Overload in Sentry due to `sentry-php`:** Impact: Medium. Focused context and breadcrumbs from `sentry-php` improve Sentry's usability for debugging.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - User context is added via `sentry-php`, but review and sanitization are inconsistent. Default breadcrumbs are mostly enabled in `config/sentry.php`.
        *   Location: User context setup in application code and breadcrumb configuration in `config/sentry.php`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematic review and minimization of context data usage with `sentry-php` calls.
        *   Customization or disabling of breadcrumbs in `sentry.php`, especially for HTTP requests and database queries.
        *   Guidelines for developers on responsible context data usage with `sentry-php`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure DSN Management for `sentry-php`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dsn_management_for__sentry-php_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment Variables for DSN:** Store the Sentry DSN as an environment variable (e.g., `SENTRY_DSN`) accessed by your application and `sentry-php`.
    2.  **`sentry.php` Configuration via Environment Variable:** Configure `sentry-php` in `sentry.php` to retrieve the DSN from the environment variable using `env('SENTRY_DSN')`.
    3.  **Avoid Hardcoding DSN in `sentry-php` Configuration:** Never hardcode the DSN directly into `sentry.php` or any other application code that might be version controlled.
    4.  **Secure Access to DSN Environment:** Restrict access to the environment where the DSN environment variable is stored to authorized personnel and systems.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **DSN Exposure in Public Repositories via `sentry-php` Configuration:** Severity: High.  Accidentally committing a hardcoded DSN in `sentry.php` to a public repository allows unauthorized event submission to your Sentry project.
        *   **Unauthorized Use of `sentry-php` DSN:** Severity: Medium. If the DSN is leaked, unauthorized individuals could potentially use it to send events to your Sentry project.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DSN Exposure in Public Repositories via `sentry-php` Configuration:** Impact: High. Secure DSN management for `sentry-php` prevents accidental public exposure and mitigates unauthorized event submission.
