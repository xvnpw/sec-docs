# Threat Model Analysis for getsentry/sentry-php

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage via Error Reports](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_via_error_reports.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information if it is inadvertently included in error reports sent to Sentry. This could happen if developers fail to sanitize data before sending it, or if sensitive data is present in application variables or configurations captured by Sentry. An attacker with access to the Sentry project could then view this leaked data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential exposure of user PII, application secrets, or internal system details. Could lead to identity theft, account compromise, or further attacks based on leaked information.

**Affected Component:** `sentry-php` core library, specifically data capturing and sending mechanisms (e.g., `captureException`, `captureMessage`, context data handling).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement data scrubbing using `before_send` and `before_breadcrumb` hooks.
* Minimize context data sent to Sentry, only include necessary information.
* Sanitize error messages generated by the application.
* Regularly review `sentry-php` configuration and data scrubbing rules.
* Apply principle of least privilege for Sentry project access.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in `sentry-php` itself or its dependencies. This could allow them to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the application server, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact. Potential for full system compromise depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** `sentry-php` library and its dependencies (listed in `composer.json` or `composer.lock`).

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `sentry-php` and its dependencies.
* Implement automated dependency scanning.
* Include `sentry-php` in regular security audits and penetration testing.
* Monitor security advisories for PHP and related libraries.
