# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Sentry PHP SDK, aims to provide error tracking and performance monitoring capabilities for PHP applications. By integrating this SDK into their PHP applications, developers can capture and report errors, exceptions, and performance data to the Sentry platform. This allows for proactive identification and resolution of issues, leading to improved application stability, user experience, and faster debugging cycles.

- Business priorities:
  - Application stability and reliability.
  - Faster issue resolution and debugging.
  - Improved user experience through reduced errors and performance issues.
  - Data-driven insights into application health and performance.

- Business risks:
  - Data breaches of error and performance data sent to Sentry.
  - Service disruption if the SDK or Sentry platform becomes unavailable.
  - Reputational damage if sensitive data is exposed through error reports.
  - Compliance risks if data handling practices are not aligned with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Secure coding practices are likely followed during development, although explicit documentation within the repository needs to be verified. (Location: Repository code and potentially contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Dependency management using Composer to manage third-party libraries. (Location: `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files).
  - security control: HTTPS is used for communication with the Sentry backend. (Location: Code within the SDK handling communication).
  - security control: API keys are used for authentication with the Sentry backend. (Location: Documentation and code examples within the repository).

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies managed by Composer.
  - accepted risk: Potential for insecure configurations by users when integrating the SDK.
  - accepted risk: Exposure of API keys if not handled securely by users.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature implies reliance on community contributions, which may introduce vulnerabilities if not properly reviewed.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the development pipeline to identify potential security flaws in the code.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions.
  - security control: Provide clear and comprehensive security guidelines for users on how to securely configure and use the SDK, including API key management and data sanitization.
  - security control: Implement a process for security vulnerability reporting and incident response.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The SDK must securely authenticate with the Sentry backend using API keys.
    - Requirement: API keys should be treated as secrets and not hardcoded in the application.
    - Requirement: Support for different authentication methods offered by Sentry, if applicable.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The SDK should operate within the authorization context of the Sentry project it is configured for.
    - Requirement: Ensure that data is only sent to the authorized Sentry project.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: The SDK should validate and sanitize data before sending it to the Sentry backend to prevent injection attacks or data corruption.
    - Requirement: Users should be guided on how to sanitize sensitive data before capturing it with the SDK.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: All communication between the SDK and the Sentry backend must be encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Consider encryption of sensitive data within the SDK itself if it is stored locally or temporarily before transmission (though less likely for an SDK).

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment of the Sentry PHP SDK is inherently tied to the deployment of the PHP application itself. The SDK is a library that is integrated into the application code and runs within the application's deployment environment.

Common PHP Application Deployment Architectures:
1. Traditional Web Server (Apache/Nginx with PHP-FPM)
2. Containerized Deployment (Docker/Kubernetes)
3. Serverless Deployment (AWS Lambda, etc. - less common for full PHP applications but possible for specific use cases)

We will focus on a common Containerized Deployment using Docker and Kubernetes for illustration.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process we are trying to protect:
  - Application Monitoring and Error Tracking: Ensuring the continuous and reliable monitoring of PHP applications to identify and resolve issues quickly. This directly impacts application uptime, user experience, and developer productivity.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Error Data: Stack traces, error messages, application logs, user context data (IP address, user ID, etc.).
    - Sensitivity: Can range from low to high depending on the application and what data is captured. Stack traces might reveal code implementation details. User context data can be PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
  - Performance Data: Transaction timings, resource usage, performance metrics.
    - Sensitivity: Generally lower sensitivity than error data, but can still reveal application behavior and potentially indirect information about users or business processes.

  - Data Sensitivity Levels:
    - Low: Generic error messages, performance metrics without user context.
    - Medium: Stack traces, application logs, non-sensitive user context (e.g., generic user roles).
    - High: PII within error reports (e.g., email addresses, usernames, sensitive user IDs), business-critical application data exposed in logs or errors.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the target audience for this design document? Is it for internal Sentry developers, external contributors, or security auditors?
  - What is the assumed risk appetite of organizations using the Sentry PHP SDK? (Startup vs. Fortune 500).
  - Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that the SDK and its users need to adhere to?
  - What is the expected level of data sensitivity for applications using the SDK? Are they handling highly sensitive PII or primarily non-sensitive data?
  - Are there specific deployment environments that are prioritized or need special consideration?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a reliable and secure error tracking solution for PHP applications, improving application quality and developer efficiency.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows general secure coding practices for open-source projects. Security is a concern, but the primary focus is on functionality and usability. Users are expected to take responsibility for secure configuration and data sanitization when using the SDK.
  - DESIGN: The SDK is designed as a library to be integrated into standard PHP applications, deployed in common web server or containerized environments. The build process uses standard PHP development tools and CI/CD practices. Data sensitivity is assumed to be moderate, requiring HTTPS for transit and reasonable care in handling error data, but not necessarily end-to-end encryption within the SDK itself.
