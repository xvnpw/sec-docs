Here are the high and critical threats directly involving the `getsentry/sentry-php` library:

*   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Error Reports
    *   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to the Sentry dashboard (through compromised credentials or other means) and analyze error reports. These reports could inadvertently contain sensitive information like API keys, passwords, personally identifiable information (PII), or internal system details *captured by Sentry-PHP* during error reporting. The attacker could then use this information for malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, identity theft, compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Sentry-PHP Component:** Data Sanitization/Scrubbing Module, Context Capture.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust data scrubbing rules in the Sentry-PHP configuration to redact sensitive information before it's sent to Sentry.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive data in the application code that might be captured by Sentry.
        *   Regularly review the data being captured by Sentry and refine scrubbing rules as needed.
        *   Implement strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for the Sentry dashboard.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Error Transmission
    *   **Description:** If the communication *between Sentry-PHP and the Sentry server* is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTP instead of HTTPS due to misconfiguration in Sentry-PHP's transport settings), an attacker on the network could intercept the error reports being transmitted. This allows the attacker to read the contents of the error reports, potentially exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained within error reports.
    *   **Affected Sentry-PHP Component:** Transport Layer, HTTP Client.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that Sentry-PHP is configured to use HTTPS for all communication with the Sentry server. This is the default and should be verified.
        *   Verify the SSL/TLS certificate of the Sentry server.
