# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for getsentry/sentry-php

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Scrubbing via `before_send` Callback](./mitigation_strategies/data_scrubbing_via__before_send__callback.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a robust `before_send` callback.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a Callback Function:** Define a PHP function that will be called before each event is sent to Sentry. This function receives the `Event` object as an argument.
    2.  **Inspect the Event:** Within the function, access the various parts of the `Event` object:
        *   `$event->getRequest()->getData()`:  Request data (POST, GET, etc.).
        *   `$event->getRequest()->getHeaders()`: Request headers.
        *   `$event->getUser()`: User context.
        *   `$event->getContexts()`:  Other context data (e.g., custom tags, extra data).
        *   `$event->getBreadcrumbs()`:  Breadcrumbs (sequence of events).
        *   `$event->getExceptions()`: Exception details.
    3.  **Identify Sensitive Data:**  Use a combination of techniques to identify sensitive data:
        *   **Known Keys:**  If you know the names of sensitive keys (e.g., `password`, `credit_card`), directly check for and remove them.
        *   **Regular Expressions:** Use *precise* regular expressions to match patterns of sensitive data (e.g., email addresses, social security numbers).  Test these *thoroughly*.
        *   **Whitelisting:**  Define a list of *allowed* keys/values and remove anything not on the list. This is generally safer than blacklisting.
    4.  **Redact or Remove:**  For each piece of sensitive data:
        *   **`null` it out:**  Set the value to `null`.  This is the simplest approach.
        *   **Replace with a Placeholder:**  Replace the value with a placeholder like `[REDACTED]`.
        *   **Hash (if needed for tracking):**  Use a strong, salted hashing algorithm (e.g., `password_hash` for passwords, SHA-256 with a salt for other data) if you need to track the *existence* of the data but not its value.
    5.  **Modify the Event:**  Update the `Event` object with the scrubbed data.  For example:
        ```php
        $requestData = $event->getRequest()->getData();
        if (isset($requestData['password'])) {
            $requestData['password'] = null; // Or '[REDACTED]'
        }
        $event->getRequest()->setData($requestData);
        ```
    6.  **Return the Event (or `null`):**  Return the modified `$event` object.  If you want to *completely prevent* the event from being sent, return `null`.
    7.  **Register the Callback:**  When initializing the Sentry SDK, register your callback function:
        ```php
        \Sentry\init([
            'dsn' => 'your_dsn',
            'before_send' => 'your_before_send_callback_function',
        ]);
        ```
    8. **Test Extensively:** Use a development Sentry DSN and trigger various errors to ensure scrubbing is working correctly. Inspect the data received by Sentry.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Severity: High):**  Reduces the risk of sensitive data (PII, credentials, etc.) being sent to Sentry.
    *   **Data Manipulation/Poisoning (Severity: Low):**  Indirectly helps by limiting the data available for manipulation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:**  Significantly reduces the risk.  The effectiveness depends on the thoroughness of the scrubbing logic.  Reduces risk by 80-95% if implemented correctly.
    *   **Data Manipulation/Poisoning:**  Provides a small reduction in risk (perhaps 10-20%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Implemented in `src/ErrorHandling/SentryHandler.php`, but only removes `password` fields from request data.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing scrubbing of user context data (`$event->getUser()`).
    *   Missing scrubbing of breadcrumbs (`$event->getBreadcrumbs()`).
    *   Missing scrubbing of custom context data (`$event->getContexts()`).
    *   No regular expression-based scrubbing for PII like email addresses.
    *   No whitelisting approach is used.
    *   Needs more comprehensive testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Updates (of `sentry-php`)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_updates__of__sentry-php__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep `sentry-php` and its dependencies up-to-date.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Composer:**  Ensure `sentry-php` is managed via Composer (`composer.json`).
    2.  **Regularly Run `composer update`:**  At least weekly, run `composer update` to update all dependencies, including `sentry-php`, to their latest compatible versions.
    3.  **Review Changelogs:**  Before updating, review the changelogs for `sentry-php` and its dependencies to identify any security fixes or breaking changes.
    4.  **Test After Update:**  After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure that the update hasn't introduced any regressions.
    5.  **Automate (Ideally):**  Integrate dependency updates into your CI/CD pipeline.  Use tools like Dependabot (GitHub) or Renovate to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates.
    6.  **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for PHP, Composer, and `sentry-php`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium to High):**  Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in `sentry-php` or its dependencies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Significantly reduces the risk, especially if updates are applied promptly after vulnerabilities are disclosed. Reduces risk by 70-90% depending on update frequency.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Composer is used, and updates are run occasionally, but not on a regular schedule.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot).
    *   No formal schedule for running `composer update`.
    *   No documented process for reviewing changelogs before updating.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment Differentiation with Separate DSNs](./mitigation_strategies/environment_differentiation_with_separate_dsns.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Use different Sentry DSNs for different environments.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Multiple Sentry Projects:**  In your Sentry account, create separate projects for each environment (e.g., "My App - Development", "My App - Staging", "My App - Production").
    2.  **Obtain DSNs:**  For each project, obtain the corresponding DSN (a unique URL).
    3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**  Store the DSNs in environment variables (e.g., `SENTRY_DSN_DEVELOPMENT`, `SENTRY_DSN_STAGING`, `SENTRY_DSN_PRODUCTION`).  *Do not* hardcode DSNs in your code.
    4.  **Load DSN Based on Environment:**  In your application's initialization code, load the appropriate DSN based on the current environment (e.g., using an environment variable like `APP_ENV`).
        ```php
        $environment = getenv('APP_ENV'); // e.g., 'development', 'staging', 'production'
        $dsn = getenv('SENTRY_DSN_' . strtoupper($environment));

        \Sentry\init([
            'dsn' => $dsn,
            // ... other options
        ]);
        ```
    5. **Conditional Sentry Initialization (Optional):** You might choose to *completely disable* Sentry in certain environments (e.g., local development):
        ```php
          if ($environment !== 'development') {
              \Sentry\init([
                  'dsn' => $dsn,
                  // ... other options
              ]);
          }

        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Severity: Medium):**  Prevents development/testing data (which might contain sensitive information or be less carefully scrubbed) from being mixed with production data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:**  Reduces the risk of accidental exposure of development data. Reduces risk by 50-70%.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes. Implemented in `config/sentry.php` using environment variables.

*   **Missing Implementation:** None. This strategy is fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side Rate Limiting (within `before_send`)](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_rate_limiting__within__before_send__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement rate limiting within the `before_send` callback.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Rate Limiting Strategy:**
        *   **Simple Counter:**  Track the number of events sent within a time window (e.g., per minute).
        *   **Token Bucket:**  A more sophisticated algorithm that allows for bursts of events.
        *   **External Rate Limiter (e.g., Redis):**  Use a shared rate limiter if you have multiple application instances.
    2.  **Implement in `before_send`:**  Within your `before_send` callback:
        *   **Check the Rate Limit:**  Determine if the rate limit has been exceeded.
        *   **Drop Events (if exceeded):**  If the rate limit is exceeded, return `null` from the `before_send` callback to prevent the event from being sent.
        *   **Log Locally (Optional):**  Log a warning to your application's logs indicating that events are being dropped due to rate limiting.
    3.  **Example (Simple Counter):**
        ```php
        function before_send_callback($event) {
            static $eventCount = 0;
            static $lastReset = 0;
            $limit = 100; // 100 events per minute
            $window = 60;  // 60 seconds

            $now = time();
            if ($now - $lastReset > $window) {
                $eventCount = 0;
                $lastReset = $now;
            }

            if ($eventCount >= $limit) {
                // Log a warning (optional)
                error_log('Sentry rate limit exceeded. Dropping event.');
                return null; // Drop the event
            }

            $eventCount++;

            // ... (your other scrubbing logic) ...

            return $event;
        }
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Sentry (Severity: Low):**  Prevents your application from overwhelming your Sentry instance with too many events.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS against Sentry:**  Significantly reduces the risk. Reduces risk by 90-95% if implemented correctly.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No rate limiting logic is currently implemented in the `before_send` callback or anywhere else in the project.  This needs to be added to `src/ErrorHandling/SentryHandler.php`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Sentry SDK Options](./mitigation_strategies/configure_sentry_sdk_options.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize built-in Sentry SDK options for data handling and limits.

* **Description:**
    1.  **Review Options:**  Examine the `sentry-php` documentation for configuration options related to data handling and limits. Key options include:
        *   `send_default_pii`: Set to `false` to disable sending potentially sensitive data by default.
        *   `max_breadcrumbs`: Limit the number of breadcrumbs.
        *   `max_value_length`: Limit the length of string values.
        *   `attach_stacktrace`: Control whether stack traces are attached (can contain sensitive file paths/code).
        *   `release`:  Set a release version to track errors across deployments.
        *   `environment`: Set the environment (e.g., 'production', 'staging').
    2.  **Configure in `\Sentry\init()`:**  Set these options when initializing the Sentry SDK:
        ```php
        \Sentry\init([
            'dsn' => 'your_dsn',
            'send_default_pii' => false,
            'max_breadcrumbs' => 50,
            'max_value_length' => 255,
            'attach_stacktrace' => true, // Consider setting to false if necessary
            'release' => '1.0.0', // Use your application's version
            'environment' => 'production',
            // ... other options
        ]);
        ```
    3. **Test:** Verify that the options are working as expected by triggering errors and inspecting the data in Sentry.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Severity: Medium):**  Reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data sent to Sentry.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Sentry (Severity: Low):**  Limits the size and number of events, reducing the load on Sentry.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Provides a moderate reduction in risk. Reduces risk by 20-40%.
    *   **DoS against Sentry:** Provides a small reduction in risk. Reduces risk by 10-20%.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `send_default_pii` is set to `false`. `release` and `environment` are set.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `max_breadcrumbs` and `max_value_length` are not explicitly configured.
    *   `attach_stacktrace` should be reviewed and potentially set to `false` if file paths/code are considered sensitive. Needs to be reviewed and potentially updated in `config/sentry.php`.
