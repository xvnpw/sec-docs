## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

1.  **Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **Unpatched Vulnerability (CVE-XXXX) [HIGH RISK] leading to RCE {CRITICAL}:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability (identified by a CVE number) in a specific version of the `sentry-php` library. This vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the application server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the existence of a published CVE and the speed of patching.)
        *   **Impact:** High (RCE grants full control of the server.)
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Public exploits are often available.)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (Script kiddies can use existing exploits; others can develop their own.)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS/WAFs might detect known patterns, but zero-days are harder.)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Keep `sentry-php` updated to the latest version.
            *   Implement a vulnerability scanning and patching process.
            *   Monitor security advisories.
            *   Use dependency management tools.
    *    **Data Exfiltration via Unsafe Deserialization {CRITICAL}:**
        *    **Description:** If `sentry-php` or the application's interaction with it involves insecure deserialization of untrusted data, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object. When this object is deserialized, it can trigger unintended code execution, leading to data exfiltration.
        *    **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
        *    **Impact:** High
        *    **Effort:** Medium-High
        *    **Skill Level:** Medium-High
        *    **Detection Difficulty:** High
        *    **Mitigation:**
            *   Review code for any instances of deserialization.
            *   Ensure only trusted data is deserialized.
            *   Implement whitelisting or type checking.
            *   Avoid deserializing data from user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Sentry Configuration/Integration](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_sentry_configurationintegration.md)

2.  **Manipulate Sentry Configuration/Integration:**

    *   **Leak Sentry DSN [HIGH RISK] leading to Expose Sensitive Data {CRITICAL}:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker obtains the Sentry DSN, which contains the credentials to send data to the Sentry instance. This can happen through various means, such as exposed environment variables, hardcoded values in client-side code, accidental commits to public repositories, or server log exposure. With the DSN, the attacker can send crafted error reports containing sensitive data from other applications (if the same DSN is misused across multiple apps) or potentially inject malicious data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Accidental DSN exposure is a common mistake.)
        *   **Impact:** Medium-High (Depends on the data sent to Sentry; could expose credentials, PII, etc.)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Once the DSN is leaked, sending data is trivial.)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic scripting knowledge is sufficient.)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring for unauthorized access to the Sentry instance and analyzing the data.)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Never hardcode the DSN.
            *   Use environment variables or a secrets management solution.
            *   Audit codebase and deployments for exposed DSNs.
            *   Implement least privilege for the DSN.
            *   Rotate DSNs periodically.
            *   Use unique DSNs per application and environment.
