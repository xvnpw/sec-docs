# Attack Surface Analysis for getsentry/sentry-php

## Attack Surface: [1. Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_surfaces/1__sensitive_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** Unintentional leakage of confidential information within error reports sent to Sentry.
**How `sentry-php` Contributes:** The SDK is the *direct* mechanism for collecting and transmitting error data, including potentially sensitive information if not properly handled by the application code using the SDK.
**Example:** An unhandled exception includes a database query with hardcoded credentials in the stack trace, which `sentry-php` captures and transmits.
**Impact:**
    *   Data breach (PII, credentials, etc.), leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.
    *   Exposure of internal system details, facilitating further attacks.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Scrubbing (Before Send):** *Mandatory* implementation of robust data scrubbing using Sentry's `before_send` callback (or event processors). Use regular expressions, allow/deny lists, and custom functions to remove or redact *all* sensitive data *before* `sentry-php` transmits it. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Configure `sentry-php` to capture only the *absolute minimum* data required for debugging. Avoid capturing entire request bodies or unnecessary context.
    *   **Contextual Awareness (Developer Training):** Train developers to *never* include sensitive information in error messages or context variables that `sentry-php` might capture.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Enforce mandatory code reviews with a specific focus on how data is handled *before* being passed to `sentry-php`.
    *   **Regular Expression Audits:** Regularly review and update the regular expressions and filtering logic used for data scrubbing within the `before_send` callback.
    *   **Sentry Configuration:** Use Sentry's configuration options to disable capturing of specific data types (cookies, request bodies) if they are not strictly necessary for debugging, further limiting what `sentry-php` can transmit.

## Attack Surface: [2. DSN Exposure/Misuse](./attack_surfaces/2__dsn_exposuremisuse.md)

**Description:** The Data Source Name (DSN) is the authentication token for `sentry-php`. Its exposure allows unauthorized access to your Sentry project.
**How `sentry-php` Contributes:** The SDK *directly uses* the DSN to authenticate and send data to the Sentry server. The SDK's functionality is entirely dependent on the DSN.
**Example:** The DSN is accidentally committed to a public Git repository, and an attacker uses it to send false data via the `sentry-php` SDK in a compromised environment.
**Impact:**
    *   **Data Pollution:** Attackers can send false error reports, hindering legitimate debugging efforts.
    *   **Quota Exhaustion:** Attackers can consume your Sentry event quota.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store the DSN *exclusively* in environment variables, *never* in the codebase that `sentry-php` accesses.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Use a secure configuration management system to manage the DSN, separate from the application code that uses `sentry-php`.
    *   **Regular Rotation:** Periodically rotate the DSN to minimize the impact of potential exposure.
    *   **Access Control:** Strictly limit access to the DSN to only authorized personnel and systems that require it for `sentry-php` operation.

## Attack Surface: [3. SDK/Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__sdkdependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `sentry-php` SDK itself or its direct dependencies can be exploited.
**How `sentry-php` Contributes:** This is a *direct* vulnerability of the SDK code itself or the code it directly depends on.
**Example:** A newly discovered vulnerability in `sentry-php` allows an attacker to inject malicious data into error reports, potentially leading to XSS on the Sentry dashboard.
**Impact:**
    *   Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution (if the vulnerability is in a dependency used in a critical part of the application).
**Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update the `sentry-php` SDK and *all* its dependencies to the latest versions using Composer. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employ vulnerability scanning tools (Snyk, Dependabot, etc.) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in `sentry-php` and its dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to `sentry-php`, PHP, and its dependency ecosystem.

## Attack Surface: [4. Insecure Transport (Unlikely but Important)](./attack_surfaces/4__insecure_transport__unlikely_but_important_.md)

**Description:** Using HTTP instead of HTTPS for communication between `sentry-php` and the Sentry server.
**How `sentry-php` Contributes:** The SDK *directly* handles the communication with the Sentry server, including the transport protocol.
**Example:** The DSN is somehow misconfigured (extremely unlikely with default settings) to use `http://` instead of `https://`, causing `sentry-php` to transmit data insecurely.
**Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks: Attackers could intercept and potentially modify error reports sent by `sentry-php`.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure the DSN *always* uses the `https://` scheme. Verify that the `sentry-php` SDK is configured to use HTTPS (this should be the default).
    *   **Certificate Validation:** Ensure that the `sentry-php` SDK is correctly validating Sentry's SSL/TLS certificate to prevent impersonation.
