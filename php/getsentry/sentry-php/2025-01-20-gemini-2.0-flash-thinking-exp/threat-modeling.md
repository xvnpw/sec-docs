# Threat Model Analysis for getsentry/sentry-php

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Error Reports](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_error_reports.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Error Reports
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information inadvertently captured by **Sentry-PHP** during error reporting. This happens when **Sentry-PHP** automatically collects contextual data (breadcrumbs, user context, exception details) which might include API keys, passwords, user data, internal file paths, or database credentials. The attacker might compromise the Sentry project or be a malicious user with access to Sentry logs.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or further attacks on the application or its users.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `Breadcrumbs` (via **Sentry-PHP**'s capture), `Context (User, Tags, Extra)` (set via **Sentry-PHP**'s API), `Exception Handling` (handled by **Sentry-PHP**).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust data scrubbing and filtering within **Sentry-PHP** configuration using the `before_send` or `before_breadcrumb` options to remove sensitive data before sending reports.
        *   Carefully review the data being captured by default by **Sentry-PHP** and explicitly exclude sensitive fields.
        *   Educate developers on the risks of including sensitive information in error messages or contextual data that **Sentry-PHP** might capture.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sentry-PHP Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sentry-php_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Sentry-PHP Dependencies
    *   **Description:** **Sentry-PHP** relies on other PHP libraries. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies if they are not kept up-to-date. This exploitation would occur within the application using **Sentry-PHP**.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to complete compromise of the application server, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Dependencies` (of **Sentry-PHP**).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update **Sentry-PHP** and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability management practices in the development pipeline.
        *   Use tools like Composer to manage **Sentry-PHP**'s dependencies and check for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Code Injection through Custom Handlers/Integrations](./threats/code_injection_through_custom_handlersintegrations.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection through Custom Handlers/Integrations
    *   **Description:** If developers implement custom error handlers or integrations using **Sentry-PHP**'s provided mechanisms, vulnerabilities in this custom code could introduce code injection risks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code that gets executed when the custom handler, integrated with **Sentry-PHP**, is triggered during an error.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the application server, potentially leading to complete compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Custom Integrations` (built using **Sentry-PHP**'s API), `Event Processors` (registered with **Sentry-PHP**).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test any custom error handling or integration code developed for **Sentry-PHP**.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom integrations for **Sentry-PHP**.
        *   Avoid using dynamic code execution or unsafe deserialization within custom handlers used by **Sentry-PHP**.

## Threat: [Insecure Transport of Error Data](./threats/insecure_transport_of_error_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Transport of Error Data
    *   **Description:** If the configuration of **Sentry-PHP** is somehow manipulated or defaults to insecure HTTP communication, error data sent by **Sentry-PHP** could be intercepted by attackers during transit.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of error data, including potentially sensitive information, to eavesdroppers.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Transport` (the component within **Sentry-PHP** responsible for sending data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure HTTPS is explicitly configured and enforced for communication with the Sentry server within **Sentry-PHP**'s configuration. Verify the Sentry DSN uses the `https://` protocol.
        *   Implement network security measures to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
