## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* Utilize Publicly Disclosed CVEs (e.g., Deserialization flaws in older versions):
    * Likelihood: Medium (Depends on the age of the Sentry-PHP version used)
    * Impact: High (Remote Code Execution, full application compromise)
    * Effort: Medium (Requires finding and adapting existing exploits)
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Can be detected by monitoring for unusual deserialization activity or known exploit patterns)

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Configuration Files (e.g., .env, config files)](./attack_tree_paths/access_configuration_files__e_g____env__config_files_.md)

* Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration)
    * Impact: Medium (Allows sending arbitrary data to the Sentry project)
    * Effort: Low (If files are publicly accessible or through common vulnerabilities)
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Monitoring access to sensitive files)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses in Application Code that feeds data to Sentry](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_weaknesses_in_application_code_that_feeds_data_to_sentry.md)

* Likelihood: Medium (Common application vulnerability)
    * Impact: Medium (Can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if Sentry UI doesn't sanitize, or other issues depending on how the data is used)
    * Effort: Low (Requires identifying vulnerable input points)
    * Skill Level: Low to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Monitoring for unusual characters or patterns in error reports)

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak Sensitive Information via Error Messages](./attack_tree_paths/leak_sensitive_information_via_error_messages.md)

* Trigger Errors that expose internal paths, database credentials, or other sensitive data:
    * Likelihood: Medium (Common programming mistake)
    * Impact: High (Exposure of sensitive information leading to further compromise)
    * Effort: Low to Medium (Requires understanding application logic and error handling)
    * Skill Level: Low to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Low (Requires careful review of error logs and Sentry reports)

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Sentry-PHP (e.g., guzzlehttp/guzzle)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_sentry-php__e_g___guzzlehttpguzzle_.md)

* Leverage known CVEs in dependency libraries:
    * Likelihood: Medium (Dependencies can have vulnerabilities)
    * Impact: High (Can lead to Remote Code Execution or other severe consequences depending on the vulnerability)
    * Effort: Medium (Requires identifying vulnerable dependencies and finding exploits)
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Monitoring for exploitation attempts against known dependency vulnerabilities)
