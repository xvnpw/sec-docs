# Attack Surface Analysis for dingo/api

## Attack Surface: [1. Authentication Bypass (Misconfigured Providers)](./attack_surfaces/1__authentication_bypass__misconfigured_providers_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the configured authentication providers *managed by Dingo/API* to gain unauthorized access.
*   **How API Contributes:** `dingo/api` provides and manages the authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth2, etc.), making its configuration a direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a weak or leaked JWT secret (configured *within Dingo/API*) to forge a valid token. Or, an attacker exploits a misconfigured OAuth2 redirect URI (set up *through Dingo/API*).
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise; unauthorized access to all API resources and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** `Critical`
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use strong, randomly generated secrets (JWT, OAuth2 client secrets) *within Dingo/API's configuration*. Store secrets *outside* the codebase (environment variables, secrets manager). Rigorously test OAuth2 configurations (redirect URIs, scopes) *as set up through Dingo/API*. Enforce HTTPS for all authentication methods *used by Dingo/API*. Regularly audit `dingo/api`'s authentication configurations.

## Attack Surface: [2. Authorization Bypass (Missing/Incorrect Checks within Dingo/API's Middleware)](./attack_surfaces/2__authorization_bypass__missingincorrect_checks_within_dingoapi's_middleware_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers bypass authorization checks *specifically within Dingo/API's middleware* to access resources.  This focuses on failures *within the framework's provided mechanisms*, not general application logic.
*   **How API Contributes:** `dingo/api` provides middleware for authorization.  Incorrect use or misconfiguration of *this middleware* is the direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  A developer forgets to apply the correct `dingo/api` authorization middleware to a specific route, or the middleware's configuration is flawed (e.g., incorrect role mapping).  An attacker accesses the route without the required permissions *because of this Dingo/API-specific oversight*.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches; unauthorized modification of data; privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** `High` to `Critical` (depending on the data exposed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Apply `dingo/api`'s authorization middleware consistently to *all* routes requiring protection, using a "deny by default" approach *within the framework's configuration*. Thoroughly test the middleware's configuration, including edge cases.  Ensure the middleware correctly interacts with the application's authorization logic.

## Attack Surface: [3. Denial of Service (Insufficient Rate Limiting *within Dingo/API*)](./attack_surfaces/3__denial_of_service__insufficient_rate_limiting_within_dingoapi_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the API, exploiting insufficient rate limiting *configured within Dingo/API*.
*   **How API Contributes:** `dingo/api` provides built-in rate limiting.  The vulnerability is the failure to enable or properly configure *this specific feature*.
*   **Example:**  An attacker sends thousands of requests per second because `dingo/api`'s rate limiting is disabled or set to an excessively high limit.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability; disruption of business operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** `High`
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Enable and configure `dingo/api`'s built-in rate limiting on *all* API endpoints. Set appropriate limits *within Dingo/API's configuration*. Use a robust rate limiting algorithm supported by `dingo/api`. Monitor `dingo/api`'s rate limiting logs.

## Attack Surface: [4. Data Exposure (Insecure Transformers *within Dingo/API*)](./attack_surfaces/4__data_exposure__insecure_transformers_within_dingoapi_.md)

*   **Description:** API responses expose sensitive data due to misconfigured `dingo/api` transformers.
*   **How API Contributes:** `dingo/api`'s transformers are *directly* responsible for shaping the response data.  This is a core function of the framework.
*   **Example:** A `dingo/api` transformer for a user object includes the `password_hash` field.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches; exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** `High`
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Carefully review *all* `dingo/api` transformer configurations. Use a "whitelist" approach within the transformer definitions. Ensure consistent data representation across different `dingo/api` transformers.

## Attack Surface: [5. Unpatched Dingo/API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/5__unpatched_dingoapi_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities *within the `dingo/api` package itself* are exploited.
*   **How API Contributes:** This is a direct vulnerability stemming from the use of the `dingo/api` library.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in `dingo/api`'s JWT handling allows attackers to bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** `High` to `Critical` (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Keep `dingo/api` and all its dependencies up-to-date. Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly. Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for `dingo/api`. Use dependency analysis tools.
