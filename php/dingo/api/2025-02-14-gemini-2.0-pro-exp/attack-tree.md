## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Flaws [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_flaws__high_risk_.md)

*   **Bypass Authentication Checks [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to access protected API endpoints without providing valid credentials or by circumventing the authentication process altogether.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **JWT Manipulation [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   *Forging JWTs:* Creating JWTs without the correct secret key.  This requires knowledge of the JWT structure and potentially the algorithm used.
            *   *Altering Existing JWTs:* Modifying the payload of a valid JWT (e.g., changing the user ID or roles) to gain unauthorized access. This requires intercepting a valid token.
            *   *Exploiting Weak JWT Validation:*  Taking advantage of misconfigurations in the JWT validation process, such as not verifying the signature, expiration, or issuer.
            *   *"None" Algorithm Attack:* Exploiting a severe misconfiguration where the `alg` header in the JWT is set to "none," allowing unsigned tokens to be accepted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation__high_risk_.md)

*   **Inject Invalid Data**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends malformed or unexpected data to the API, aiming to cause errors, bypass security checks, or execute malicious code.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Missing Validation [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   *Description:* The API fails to properly validate input parameters, allowing attackers to send arbitrary data. This is a fundamental flaw that enables many other attacks.
            *   *Consequences:*  Can lead to SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection, XSS, and other vulnerabilities, depending on how the unvalidated data is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Error Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_error_handling.md)

*    **Leak Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker triggers errors in the API that reveal sensitive information, such as database credentials, internal file paths, API keys, or stack traces.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Missing Handling:** If `dingo/api`'s error handling is not properly configured, detailed error messages (including stack traces, database queries, or internal file paths) might be returned to the attacker.
        *   **Verbose Error Messages:** Even with custom error handlers, the application might inadvertently include sensitive information in error responses.

*   **Trigger DoS via Error**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts requests designed to trigger errors that consume excessive server resources or cause the application to crash.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Unhandled Exceptions:** If the API doesn't properly handle exceptions, a single malicious request could crash the entire API or application.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion on Error:** If error handling logic itself consumes significant resources (e.g., excessive logging), the attacker can trigger errors to exhaust resources.
