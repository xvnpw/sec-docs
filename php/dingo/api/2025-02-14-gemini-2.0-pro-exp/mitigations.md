# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dingo/api

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Route Definition and Validation (using `dingo/api`)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_route_definition_and_validation__using__dingoapi__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Route Definition and Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`dingo/api` Route Definitions:**  Use `dingo/api`'s routing mechanisms (`api.Group`, `api.POST`, `api.GET`, etc.) to *explicitly* define all routes. Avoid any "magic" routing or undocumented endpoints.
    2.  **Consistent Naming:**  Maintain a consistent and well-documented naming convention for all routes within the `dingo/api` framework.
    3.  **Code Reviews (Focus on `dingo/api` Usage):**  Mandate code reviews, specifically checking for:
        *   Correct use of `dingo/api`'s routing functions.
        *   Adherence to the naming convention.
        *   Proper application of middleware (authentication, authorization, validation) *within* the `dingo/api` route definitions.
        *   No "shadow" routes or workarounds that bypass `dingo/api`.
    4.  **Automated Route Testing (Targeting `dingo/api`):**  Implement automated tests that:
        *   Use `dingo/api`'s testing utilities (if available) or directly interact with the defined routes.
        *   Verify that all `dingo/api`-defined routes are accessible and return expected responses.
        *   Attempt to access routes *not* defined within `dingo/api` and verify rejection.
        *   Test different HTTP methods against `dingo/api` routes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Endpoint Exposure (Severity: High):** Prevents exposure of endpoints not explicitly defined within `dingo/api`.
    *   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization (Severity: High):** Ensures that `dingo/api`'s middleware for authentication/authorization is correctly applied to all intended routes.
    *   **Inconsistent API Behavior (Severity: Medium):**  Ensures that all API interactions go through the defined `dingo/api` routes, providing a consistent interface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Endpoint Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced by strictly defining routes within `dingo/api`.
    *   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:** Risk significantly reduced by ensuring consistent middleware application.
    *   **Inconsistent API Behavior:** Risk minimized by enforcing the use of `dingo/api` for all API interactions.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic route definitions using `dingo/api` are in place.
    *   Code reviews are mandatory.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive negative tests specifically targeting `dingo/api` routes are missing.
    *   Formalized audits of `dingo/api` route definitions are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Versioning Control (within `dingo/api`)](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_versioning_control__within__dingoapi__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Explicit Versioning Control
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`dingo/api` Versioning Features:**  *Exclusively* use `dingo/api`'s built-in versioning mechanisms (e.g., route prefixes like `/v1`, `/v2`, or versioning headers). Do *not* rely on any custom versioning schemes outside of `dingo/api`.
    2.  **Deprecation Policy (Tied to `dingo/api`):**  Define a clear deprecation policy that leverages `dingo/api`'s features:
        *   Use `dingo/api`'s mechanisms (if available) to mark routes as deprecated.
        *   Communicate deprecation through `dingo/api`-provided means (e.g., deprecation headers, if supported).
    3.  **`dingo/api` Deprecation Middleware:** Implement middleware *within* the `dingo/api` framework that:
        *   Detects requests to deprecated routes (using `dingo/api`'s routing information).
        *   Logs these requests.
        *   Returns deprecation warnings using `dingo/api`'s response handling (if supported).
    4.  **`dingo/api` Version Enforcement Middleware:** Implement middleware *within* `dingo/api` that rejects requests to unsupported or invalid API versions, using `dingo/api`'s versioning information.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Deprecated Routes (Severity: Medium-High):** Prevents exploitation of vulnerabilities in older API versions managed by `dingo/api`.
    *   **Compatibility Issues (Severity: Medium):**  Provides a consistent versioning mechanism within `dingo/api`.
    *   **Unintentional Use of Old Versions (Severity: Low-Medium):** Enforces the use of supported `dingo/api` versions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced over time as `dingo/api` versions are deprecated and removed.
    *   **Compatibility:** Risk minimized by using `dingo/api`'s versioning consistently.
    *   **Unintentional Use of Old Versions:** Risk largely eliminated by enforcing versioning within `dingo/api`'s middleware.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `dingo/api` versioning (route prefixes) is used.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `dingo/api`-specific deprecation middleware is not implemented.
    *   `dingo/api`-specific version enforcement middleware is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Request Validation (using `dingo/api` features)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_request_validation__using__dingoapi__features_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Comprehensive Request Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`dingo/api` Validation Mechanisms:**  Utilize `dingo/api`'s built-in request validation features *exclusively*. This likely involves:
        *   Struct tags on request models (e.g., `validate:"required,email"`).
        *   Custom validators registered with `dingo/api`.
        *   `dingo/api`'s mechanisms for binding request data to models.
    2.  **Validate All Input Sources (within `dingo/api`):**  Ensure that *all* input sources handled by `dingo/api` are validated:
        *   Request bodies (JSON, XML, etc.) parsed by `dingo/api`.
        *   Query parameters accessed through `dingo/api`.
        *   Headers accessed through `dingo/api`.
        *   Path parameters extracted by `dingo/api`.
    3.  **`dingo/api` Error Handling:**  Leverage `dingo/api`'s error handling to automatically reject requests with invalid data *before* any custom application logic is executed.  Ensure `dingo/api` is configured to return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
    4.  **Automated Testing (Targeting `dingo/api` Validation):** Implement tests that specifically exercise `dingo/api`'s validation rules:
        *   Send valid and invalid data to `dingo/api` endpoints.
        *   Verify that `dingo/api` correctly validates the input and returns appropriate responses.
    5. **`dingo/api` Transformers:** Utilize `dingo/api` transformers to perform data type conversions and basic sanitization *before* the validation logic within `dingo/api` is executed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (Severity: High):**  `dingo/api`'s validation (when properly configured) can help prevent injection attacks by ensuring data conforms to expected types and patterns.
    *   **Data Type Mismatches (Severity: Medium):** `dingo/api`'s validation enforces data types.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Severity: Low-Medium):** `dingo/api`'s validation ensures data is valid before reaching application logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced, *provided* `dingo/api`'s validation is comprehensive and correctly configured.
    *   **Data Type Mismatches:** Risk largely eliminated.
    *   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk reduced.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some request models use struct tags for validation within `dingo/api`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Validation is not consistently applied to *all* input sources handled by `dingo/api`.
    *   More comprehensive validation rules (regular expressions, custom validators) are needed within `dingo/api`'s configuration.
    *   Automated tests specifically targeting `dingo/api`'s validation are limited.
    *   Transformers are not consistently used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handling (within `dingo/api`)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handling__within__dingoapi__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Custom Error Handling
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`dingo/api` Error Handler Override:**  Implement a custom error handler that *completely* overrides `dingo/api`'s default error handling.  This handler should be registered with `dingo/api`.
    2.  **Internal Logging (Separate from `dingo/api`):**  While the custom handler is part of `dingo/api`, the *logging* should be handled separately (using a dedicated logging library). Log detailed error information, including stack traces, *outside* of `dingo/api`'s response handling.
    3.  **Generic Client Responses (via `dingo/api`):**  Use `dingo/api`'s response mechanisms to return generic, user-friendly error messages to the client.  *Never* expose internal error details or stack traces through `dingo/api`.
    4.  **Standardized Error Format (using `dingo/api`):**  If `dingo/api` supports it, use a standardized error format (e.g., JSON API error objects) for consistency.
    5.  **`dingo/api` Integration:** Ensure the custom error handler is correctly integrated with `dingo/api`'s request lifecycle.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium-High):** Prevents `dingo/api` from leaking sensitive information in error responses.
    *   **Consistent User Experience (Severity: Low):**  Provides a consistent error experience through `dingo/api`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced by preventing `dingo/api` from exposing internal details.
    *   **Consistent User Experience:** Improved user experience.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A basic custom error handler is defined, but it's not fully integrated with `dingo/api` and still leaks some information.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The custom error handler needs to be fully integrated with `dingo/api` and completely prevent information disclosure.
    *   A standardized error format (using `dingo/api`'s features, if available) is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization (using `dingo/api` Middleware)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization__using__dingoapi__middleware_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Authentication and Authorization (using `dingo/api` Middleware)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`dingo/api` Authentication Middleware:**  Use `dingo/api`'s middleware system to implement authentication.  This likely involves:
        *   Registering authentication middleware with `dingo/api`.
        *   Using `dingo/api`'s mechanisms for accessing authenticated user information within request handlers.
    2.  **`dingo/api` Authorization Middleware:**  Use `dingo/api`'s middleware system to implement authorization *after* authentication.  This involves:
        *   Registering authorization middleware with `dingo/api`.
        *   Applying authorization checks to specific routes or groups of routes *within* `dingo/api`.
        *   Using `dingo/api`'s context to access user roles or permissions.
    3.  **Route-Specific Middleware:** Apply authentication and authorization middleware *specifically* to the `dingo/api` routes that require it. Avoid global middleware that might unintentionally affect other parts of the application.
    4. **Rate Limiting (within `dingo/api` Auth context):** If `dingo/api` provides mechanisms, implement rate limiting *within* the authentication middleware or logic to protect authentication endpoints.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** `dingo/api`'s middleware enforces authentication and authorization.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium-High):** Rate limiting within `dingo/api`'s authentication context mitigates these attacks.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** `dingo/api`'s authorization middleware prevents unauthorized privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced by using `dingo/api`'s middleware.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk mitigated if rate limiting is implemented within `dingo/api`.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   JWT authentication is used, with some integration with `dingo/api`'s middleware.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authorization middleware within `dingo/api` is not consistently applied.
    *   Rate limiting within the `dingo/api` authentication context is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Response Handling (Leveraging `dingo/api`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_response_handling__leveraging__dingoapi__.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Response Handling
*   **Description:**
    1.  **`Content-Type` with `dingo/api`:**  Always use `dingo/api`'s response methods to explicitly set the `Content-Type` header.
    2.  **`Accept` Header Validation (within `dingo/api`):**  Use `dingo/api`'s request handling to validate the `Accept` header and ensure the response `Content-Type` is compatible.
    3.  **Security Headers (via `dingo/api` Middleware):** Implement a middleware *within* `dingo/api` to automatically add security-related HTTP headers to all responses handled by `dingo/api`:
        *   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
        *   `X-Content-Type-Options`
        *   `X-Frame-Options`
        *   `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
        *   `X-XSS-Protection`
    4.  **Response Sanitization (Before `dingo/api` Response):**  Ensure that any data being returned through `dingo/api`'s response methods is properly sanitized *before* it's passed to `dingo/api`. This is crucial for preventing XSS.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **MIME-Sniffing (Severity: Medium):** `X-Content-Type-Options` (set via `dingo/api` middleware) prevents this.
    *   **Clickjacking (Severity: Medium):** `X-Frame-Options` (set via `dingo/api` middleware) prevents this.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** CSP (set via `dingo/api` middleware) and pre-response sanitization mitigate XSS.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) (Severity: High):** HSTS (set via `dingo/api` middleware) enforces HTTPS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **MIME-Sniffing:** Risk eliminated.
    *   **Clickjacking:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **MITM:** Risk significantly reduced (with proper HTTPS configuration).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `dingo/api` is used to set `Content-Type`, but validation against `Accept` is inconsistent.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `dingo/api` middleware for security headers is not implemented.
    *   Consistent sanitization *before* using `dingo/api`'s response methods is missing.
