# Threat Model Analysis for dingo/api

## Threat: [JWT Secret Key Compromise](./threats/jwt_secret_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the secret key used by `dingo/api`'s JWT authentication handler for signing and verifying JWTs.  This could happen if the secret is exposed due to a `dingo/api` configuration issue (e.g., a default secret not being changed, or an insecure way of loading the secret that `dingo/api` might inadvertently encourage). The attacker can then forge valid JWTs, impersonating any user.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.  The attacker gains full control over the API.
    *   **API Component Affected:** Authentication middleware (specifically, the JWT authentication handler within `dingo/api/auth`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** use default secret keys provided by `dingo/api` (if any).  Always generate a strong, unique secret.
        *   Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store the secret key, following best practices *as recommended by the dingo/api documentation*.
        *   Implement key rotation, following `dingo/api`'s recommended procedures (if any).
        *   Ensure that `dingo/api` is configured to load the secret key securely, avoiding any insecure defaults or practices.

## Threat: [Rate Limiting Bypass (Due to `dingo/api` Vulnerability)](./threats/rate_limiting_bypass__due_to__dingoapi__vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses `dingo/api`'s rate limiting due to a *vulnerability within the rate limiting implementation itself* (e.g., a race condition, logic flaw, or incorrect counting in the `dingo/api` code). This is distinct from bypassing rate limiting due to *application-level* misconfiguration.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS). The API becomes unavailable.
    *   **API Component Affected:** Rate limiting middleware (`dingo/api/middleware/rate` and the underlying rate limiter implementation used *by* `dingo/api`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `dingo/api` updated to the latest version to address any known rate limiting vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor `dingo/api`'s issue tracker and security advisories for reports of rate limiting bypasses.
        *   If a vulnerability is found, apply the recommended patch or workaround provided by the `dingo/api` maintainers.
        *   Consider using a different, more robust rate limiting implementation *if supported by dingo/api and if the built-in one is proven vulnerable*.

## Threat: [Unvalidated Redirects After Authentication (Within `dingo/api`'s Flow)](./threats/unvalidated_redirects_after_authentication__within__dingoapi_'s_flow_.md)

*   **Description:**  If `dingo/api`'s *built-in* authentication flow includes redirection logic, and that logic does *not* properly validate the redirect URL, an attacker could craft a malicious request that redirects the user to a phishing site. This is specifically about a vulnerability *within dingo/api's own handling of redirects*, not custom redirect logic added by the application.
    *   **Impact:**  User accounts compromised through phishing.
    *   **API Component Affected:** Authentication middleware and any *built-in* redirect handling within `dingo/api/auth`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   If `dingo/api` provides configuration options for redirect URLs after authentication, ensure they are set to a whitelist of allowed URLs.
        *   If `dingo/api` has *any* built-in redirect functionality, examine its code and documentation carefully to ensure it performs proper validation.  If not, report it as a vulnerability.
        *   Avoid using any built-in `dingo/api` redirect features that are not explicitly documented as secure and validated.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Impacting `dingo/api` Directly)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__impacting__dingoapi__directly_.md)

*   **Description:** `dingo/api` itself, or a *direct* dependency that `dingo/api` relies on for core functionality, contains a known vulnerability that can be exploited. This is about vulnerabilities in the libraries that `dingo/api` *uses*, not vulnerabilities in the application using `dingo/api`.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely (High to Critical) depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. Could lead to anything from DoS to RCE *through* the vulnerable `dingo/api` component.
    *   **API Component Affected:** Potentially any part of `dingo/api` that relies on the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `dingo/api` and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Go modules) to track and manage dependencies.
        *   Use a vulnerability scanner (e.g., `snyk`, `govulncheck`) to identify known vulnerabilities in `dingo/api` and its *direct* dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories and mailing lists for `dingo/api` and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Improper Input Validation in Request Transformers (Vulnerability *within* `dingo/api`)](./threats/improper_input_validation_in_request_transformers__vulnerability_within__dingoapi__.md)

* **Description:** If `dingo/api`'s request transformer logic itself contains a vulnerability that allows malicious input to bypass validation *even when struct tags are used correctly*, this would be a direct `dingo/api` issue. This is *not* about missing or incorrect struct tags in the *application* code, but a flaw in how `dingo/api` *processes* those tags.
    * **Impact:** Varies (High to Critical) depending on how the bypassed validation is used. Could lead to injection attacks or other vulnerabilities.
    * **API Component Affected:** Request transformers (`dingo/api/request`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `dingo/api` updated to the latest version.
        *   Monitor `dingo/api`'s issue tracker and security advisories for reports of vulnerabilities in the request transformer.
        *   If a vulnerability is found, apply the recommended patch or workaround.
        *   As a defense-in-depth measure, *even if dingo/api's validation is believed to be secure*, implement additional input validation and sanitization in your application logic, especially before using data in sensitive operations. This mitigates the risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities in `dingo/api`.
