## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Parameter Injection in Routes [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Critical Node:** Exploit Route Parameter Parsing Flaws [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters in API requests. If these parameters are not properly validated and sanitized before being used in backend operations (like database queries or system commands), it can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium - Common vulnerability in web applications, especially if developers directly use route parameters in queries without proper escaping.
        *   Impact: High - Can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and full application takeover depending on the injection type (SQL Injection, Command Injection, etc.).
        *   Effort: Low - Often easy to test and exploit with readily available tools.
        *   Skill Level: Medium - Requires understanding of web requests and injection principles.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Robust input validation and sanitization for all route parameters.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid directly executing system commands based on user-supplied input.

*   **Attack Vector:** Request Body Injection (JSON/XML) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Critical Node:** Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Request Parsing [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious JSON or XML payloads in API request bodies. If the application deserializes this data and processes it unsafely, it can lead to vulnerabilities. This includes deserialization attacks, XXE injection (for XML), or other injection types depending on how the data is used.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium - Applications often process request bodies, and deserialization vulnerabilities are a known risk. XML processing, if used, can be particularly vulnerable to XXE.
        *   Impact: High - Deserialization attacks can lead to remote code execution. XXE can cause data disclosure, DoS, and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
        *   Effort: Medium - Requires crafting malicious payloads, but tools and techniques are available.
        *   Skill Level: Medium - Requires understanding of deserialization and payload crafting.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Secure deserialization practices.
        *   Disable external entity processing in XML parsers to prevent XXE.
        *   Validate and sanitize data after deserialization before using it.
        *   Use safe deserialization libraries and avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into complex objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [JWT/Token Vulnerabilities (If JWT/Tokens Used with Dingo) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/jwttoken_vulnerabilities__if_jwttokens_used_with_dingo___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit JWT Secret Key Exposure (Configuration Issue, but relevant to Dingo context) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Critical Node:** Exploit JWT Secret Key Exposure [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** If the secret key used to sign JWTs is exposed (e.g., hardcoded in code, stored insecurely in configuration files, leaked through other vulnerabilities), attackers can forge valid JWTs. This allows them to bypass authentication and impersonate any user.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium - Configuration mistakes are common, and secret key management is often challenging.
        *   Impact: Critical - Complete authentication bypass, allowing attackers to access any API endpoint as any user.
        *   Effort: Low - If the key is exposed, forging JWTs is straightforward.
        *   Skill Level: Low - Requires basic understanding of JWTs and readily available tools.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Securely store JWT secret keys (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management systems).
        *   Never hardcode secret keys in the application code.
        *   Implement proper access controls for configuration files.
        *   Regularly rotate secret keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Verbose Error Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Critical Node:** Trigger Errors to Leak Sensitive Information via Dingo's Error Handling [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** If Dingo's error handling is not properly configured for production, it might expose verbose error messages to API consumers. These messages can leak sensitive information like file paths, database details, internal application logic, or even credentials.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium - Common misconfiguration, especially during development and initial deployment.
        *   Impact: Medium - Information disclosure can aid further attacks by revealing application internals and potential vulnerabilities. Can also violate privacy regulations.
        *   Effort: Low - Easy to trigger errors and observe responses.
        *   Skill Level: Low - Requires basic web request knowledge.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Configure Dingo to provide minimal, generic error messages in production.
        *   Log detailed errors securely on the server-side for debugging.
        *   Regularly review error handling configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Resource Exhaustion Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Critical Node:** Send Large Number of Requests to API Endpoints [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** Attackers flood API endpoints with a large volume of requests. This can overwhelm the server, consume resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), and lead to service disruption or complete denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   Likelihood: High - Simple and common attack vector against web applications and APIs.
        *   Impact: Medium - Service disruption, impacting availability and potentially business operations. Can be higher if critical services are affected.
        *   Effort: Low - Easy to execute with readily available tools or even simple scripts.
        *   Skill Level: Low - Requires minimal technical skill.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
        *   Use web application firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block malicious traffic.
        *   Configure server resource limits to prevent complete exhaustion.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual traffic patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Dingo API Misconfigurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_dingo_api_misconfigurations__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Improperly Secured Endpoints [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Critical Node:** Access API Endpoints Intended to be Protected due to Misconfiguration in Dingo Routing/Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** Developers might misconfigure Dingo routing or middleware, failing to apply necessary authentication or authorization to sensitive API endpoints. This allows attackers to bypass security controls and access protected resources without proper credentials.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium - Configuration errors are common, especially in complex API setups.
        *   Impact: High - Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or system compromise.
        *   Effort: Low - Often easy to identify misconfigured endpoints by simply testing access without credentials.
        *   Skill Level: Low - Requires basic understanding of API access and authorization.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement clear and consistent authentication and authorization middleware for all API endpoints.
        *   Regularly review and audit API endpoint configurations and routing rules.
        *   Use automated security testing tools to identify unprotected endpoints.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access controls.

*   **Attack Vector:** Verbose Error Reporting in Production (Configuration Issue) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Critical Node:** Leverage Verbose Errors for Information Gathering [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** Similar to the Information Disclosure section, but specifically focusing on misconfiguration as the root cause. Leaving verbose error reporting enabled in production is a configuration mistake that attackers can exploit to gather information about the application.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** (Same as Verbose Error Messages under Information Disclosure)
        *   Likelihood: Medium - Common misconfiguration.
        *   Impact: Medium - Information disclosure.
        *   Effort: Low - Easy to trigger and observe.
        *   Skill Level: Low - Basic web request knowledge.
    *   **Mitigation:** (Same as Verbose Error Messages under Information Disclosure)
        *   Configure minimal error messages in production.
        *   Secure server-side logging for detailed errors.
        *   Disable verbose error reporting in production environments.
