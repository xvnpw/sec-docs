# Attack Surface Analysis for dingo/api

## Attack Surface: [1. Unsecured or Unintended Endpoint Exposure](./attack_surfaces/1__unsecured_or_unintended_endpoint_exposure.md)

Description:  Exposing API endpoints without proper access controls or unintentionally exposing routes due to misconfiguration.
*   How API Contributes: `dingo/api`'s routing mechanism defines how URLs are mapped to handlers.  Incorrect route definitions, lack of authentication/authorization middleware in route configurations, or overly permissive route patterns directly lead to this exposure.
*   Example: Defining a route like `/admin/{entity}` with a wildcard without proper authorization middleware allows unauthorized access to administrative functions for any entity.
*   Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical data, execution of administrative functionalities, potentially leading to full application compromise.
*   Risk Severity: **Critical**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Implement Authentication and Authorization Middleware:**  Mandatory use of `dingo/api`'s middleware for authentication and authorization on all sensitive routes.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Route Definition:** Define routes with specific paths and methods, avoiding broad wildcards unless strictly necessary and secured.
    *   **Regular Route Audits:** Periodically review and audit all defined routes in `dingo/api` configuration to ensure intended exposure and proper security measures.

## Attack Surface: [2. Lack of Input Validation leading to Injection Attacks](./attack_surfaces/2__lack_of_input_validation_leading_to_injection_attacks.md)

Description:  Failure to validate user input processed by API endpoints, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, etc.
*   How API Contributes: While `dingo/api` itself doesn't enforce input validation, its request handling mechanisms (parameter parsing, request body handling) provide the entry points for user input.  If developers don't implement validation within `dingo/api` handlers or middleware, the framework facilitates the vulnerability.
*   Example: An API endpoint `/users/{id}` retrieves user data based on the `id` path parameter. If the handler directly uses the `id` in a database query without validation, SQL injection is possible.
*   Impact: Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potentially remote code execution depending on the injection type and application context.
*   Risk Severity: **High** to **Critical** (depending on the type of injection and its exploitability).
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Implement Input Validation Middleware:** Create and apply `dingo/api` middleware to validate all incoming request data (parameters, headers, body) before processing in handlers.
    *   **Use Secure Data Handling Practices:**  Employ parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize or escape user input when necessary for other contexts.
    *   **Strict Input Type Checking:** Enforce expected data types and formats for all API inputs within `dingo/api` handlers.

## Attack Surface: [3. Missing or Weak Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/3__missing_or_weak_authentication_and_authorization.md)

Description:  Absence of proper mechanisms to verify user identity (authentication) and control access to resources (authorization) within the API.
*   How API Contributes: `dingo/api` relies on developers to implement authentication and authorization using its middleware capabilities. If these are not implemented or are implemented weakly within the `dingo/api` application, the framework becomes a conduit for unauthorized access.
*   Example: An API for managing user profiles lacks any authentication middleware in `dingo/api` configuration. Anyone can access endpoints like `/api/profile/update` without proving their identity, leading to unauthorized profile modifications.
*   Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, privilege escalation, complete compromise of user accounts and application data.
*   Risk Severity: **Critical**
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Mandatory Authentication Middleware:**  Enforce authentication for all protected API endpoints using robust methods like OAuth 2.0, JWT, or API keys within `dingo/api` middleware.
    *   **Fine-Grained Authorization Logic:** Implement authorization checks within `dingo/api` handlers or middleware to control access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Access Control:** Periodically review and test authentication and authorization implementations within the `dingo/api` application.

## Attack Surface: [4. Dependency Vulnerabilities in `dingo/api` and its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/4__dependency_vulnerabilities_in__dingoapi__and_its_dependencies.md)

Description:  Vulnerabilities present in `dingo/api` itself or in the underlying Go packages it depends on.
*   How API Contributes: Applications directly rely on `dingo/api` and its dependencies. If vulnerabilities exist in these components, they become part of the application's attack surface through the use of `dingo/api`.
*   Example: A critical security flaw is discovered in a specific version of a library used by `dingo/api` for JSON parsing. Applications using that version of `dingo/api` are vulnerable to exploits targeting this flaw.
*   Impact: Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, or other impacts depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
*   Risk Severity: **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   **Regularly Update `dingo/api`:** Keep `dingo/api` updated to the latest stable version to receive security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in `dingo/api`'s dependencies and manage dependency updates proactively.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for `dingo/api` and its ecosystem to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
