**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit API Endpoint Vulnerabilities**

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the API endpoints handle requests and data.

* **Data Injection Attacks (Critical Node):** Attackers inject malicious code or commands into data inputs, which are then processed by the application, leading to unintended actions.
    * **SQL Injection (Critical Node):**
        * Attack Vector: Sending crafted input to an API endpoint that is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
        * Description: This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL query, potentially accessing, modifying, or deleting database data.
    * **NoSQL Injection (Critical Node):**
        * Attack Vector: Sending crafted input to an API endpoint that is directly used in a NoSQL database query without proper sanitization.
        * Description: Similar to SQL injection, but targets NoSQL databases, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    * **Command Injection (Critical Node):**
        * Attack Vector: Sending crafted input to an API endpoint that is used in the execution of system commands without proper sanitization.
        * Description: This allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system.

* **Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses (Critical Node):** This path targets flaws in how the application verifies user identity and controls access to resources.
    * **Authentication Bypass (Critical Node):** Attackers circumvent the authentication process to gain unauthorized access.
        * Attack Vector: Exploit flaws in custom authentication middleware.
        * Description: This involves finding weaknesses in the custom code responsible for verifying user credentials, allowing attackers to bypass it.
        * Attack Vector: Manipulate JWT tokens (if used) due to insecure signing or validation (Critical Node).
        * Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities in how JSON Web Tokens are created, signed, or validated, allowing attackers to forge valid tokens.
    * **Privilege Escalation (Critical Node):**
        * Attack Vector: Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to resources or functionalities beyond the attacker's intended privileges.
        * Description: After gaining initial access (potentially with limited privileges), attackers exploit flaws to elevate their access level.
