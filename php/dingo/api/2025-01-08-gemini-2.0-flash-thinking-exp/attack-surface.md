# Attack Surface Analysis for dingo/api

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Route Parameter Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_route_parameter_handling.md)

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Route Parameter Handling**
    * **Description:**  The application relies on route parameters provided in the URL, which can be manipulated by attackers.
    * **How API Contributes:** `dingo/api` facilitates the definition and extraction of route parameters. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate these extracted parameters, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An API endpoint `/users/{id}` might be accessed with `/users/../../admin` if the application doesn't validate the `id` parameter, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data manipulation, or execution of unintended code depending on how the parameter is used.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters within the application logic.
        * Use regular expressions or predefined patterns to enforce expected parameter formats.
        * Avoid directly using route parameters in database queries or system commands without validation.
        * Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers where appropriate to make enumeration harder.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on Request Body](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_request_body.md)

* **Attack Surface: Lack of Input Validation on Request Body**
    * **Description:** The application accepts data in the request body (e.g., JSON, XML) without proper validation.
    * **How API Contributes:** `dingo/api` handles the parsing of request bodies. If the application doesn't implement validation rules after `dingo/api` parses the data, it's vulnerable to malicious payloads.
    * **Example:** An API endpoint for creating a user might accept a JSON payload. If the `email` field isn't validated, an attacker could submit a payload with an excessively long string, leading to a buffer overflow or denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption, injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if data is used in queries), or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation on all data received in the request body.
        * Define and enforce schemas for request bodies to ensure data conforms to expected types and formats.
        * Sanitize input data to remove potentially harmful characters or code.
        * Use libraries specifically designed for input validation for the chosen data format (e.g., JSON schema validation).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Deserialization**
    * **Description:** The application deserializes data from the request body without proper safeguards, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious objects.
    * **How API Contributes:**  While `dingo/api` itself might not directly handle complex deserialization, the application using it might employ libraries that perform deserialization based on content type negotiation handled by `dingo/api`. If these libraries are vulnerable, it creates an attack surface.
    * **Example:** An API endpoint accepting serialized PHP objects (if the application is built with PHP) could be exploited by sending a crafted serialized object that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        * If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and libraries that have built-in safeguards against malicious payloads.
        * Implement integrity checks (e.g., signatures) on serialized data to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
        * Regularly update deserialization libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authentication or Authorization](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authentication_or_authorization.md)

* **Attack Surface: Insufficient Authentication or Authorization**
    * **Description:**  API endpoints are not properly protected by authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    * **How API Contributes:** `dingo/api` provides mechanisms for implementing authentication and authorization (e.g., through middleware). If these mechanisms are not correctly implemented or configured, it leads to vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** An API endpoint for retrieving user details (`/users/{id}`) is accessible without any authentication, allowing anyone to view sensitive user information. Or, an endpoint for updating user roles is accessible to unprivileged users.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform actions on behalf of other users, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust authentication mechanisms for all API endpoints that require it.
        * Use established authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
        * Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access based on user roles or permissions.
        * Ensure all API endpoints have appropriate authorization checks in place.
        * Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization configurations.
