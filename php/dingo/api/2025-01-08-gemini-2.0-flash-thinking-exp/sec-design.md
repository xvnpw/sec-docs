## 7. Data Flow

The typical data flow for an API request and response within the `dingo/api` system is outlined below:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["'Client Application'"] -- "'API Request'" --> B{"'API Gateway'"};
    B -- "'Authenticated & Routed Request'" --> C{"'Load Balancer'"};
    C -- "'Forwarded Request to Server'" --> D{"'API Server Instance 1'"}
    subgraph API Servers
    D -- "'Process Request'" --> E{"'Application Logic'"}
    E -- "'Data Access Request'" --> F{"'Data Access Layer'"}
    F -- "'Database Query'" --> G{"'Database'"}
    G -- "'Data Response'" --> F
    F -- "'Data'" --> E
    E -- "'API Response'" --> D
    end
    C -- "'Forwarded Request to Server'" --> H{"'API Server Instance 2'"}
     subgraph API Servers
    H -- "'Process Request'" --> I{"'Application Logic'"}
    I -- "'Data Access Request'" --> J{"'Data Access Layer'"}
    J -- "'Database Query'" --> K{"'Database'"}
    K -- "'Data Response'" --> J
    J -- "'Data'" --> I
    I -- "'API Response'" --> H
    end
    D -- "'Response'" --> C;
    H -- "'Response'" --> C;
    C -- "'API Response'" --> B;
    B -- "'API Response'" --> A;
```

*   The **Client Application** initiates an **API Request**.
*   The **API Gateway** receives the request, performs **authentication** and **authorization**, and **routes** it to the appropriate backend service.
*   The **Load Balancer** receives the routed request and **forwards** it to one of the available and healthy **API Server Instances**.
*   The **API Server Instance** receives the request and starts to **process** it.
*   The **Application Logic** within the API Server executes the necessary business logic.
*   The **Application Logic** makes a **Data Access Request** to the **Data Access Layer**.
*   The **Data Access Layer** constructs and executes a **Database Query** against the **Database**.
*   The **Database** returns the **Data Response** to the **Data Access Layer**.
*   The **Data Access Layer** returns the **Data** to the **Application Logic**.
*   The **Application Logic** constructs the **API Response**.
*   The **API Server Instance** sends the **Response** back to the **Load Balancer**.
*   The **Load Balancer** forwards the **API Response** back to the **API Gateway**.
*   The **API Gateway** sends the final **API Response** to the **Client Application**.

*   **Maintainability:** The API should be designed for easy maintenance and updates.

## 12. API Endpoints (Hypothetical Examples)

To make the design more concrete for threat modeling, here are some hypothetical examples of API endpoints:

*   `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of users.
*   `POST /users`: Create a new user.
*   `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific user.
*   `PUT /users/{id}`: Update an existing user.
*   `DELETE /users/{id}`: Delete a user.
*   `POST /products`: Create a new product.
*   `GET /products`: Retrieve a list of products.
