# Attack Surface Analysis for dingo/api

## Attack Surface: [Route Definition Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/route_definition_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Loosely defined or overlapping API routes can allow unintended access to functionalities or data.
    *   **How API Contributes:** Dingo's routing mechanism relies on developers defining routes. Incorrect or overly broad definitions directly create this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Defining a route like `/users/{id}` without proper constraints on `id` could allow access to resources beyond intended integer IDs (e.g., `/users/admin`).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionalities, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define specific and restrictive route patterns.
        *   Use regular expressions or type constraints within Dingo's routing to limit accepted input.
        *   Avoid overly generic route parameters.
        *   Thoroughly review and test route definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly validate data received by the API can lead to various injection attacks and data corruption.
    *   **How API Contributes:** Dingo provides mechanisms for request parsing and data handling. If developers don't implement validation within Dingo's request lifecycle, the API becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint accepting user input for a database query without sanitization could be vulnerable to SQL injection (e.g., `POST /search {"query": "'; DROP TABLE users; --"}`).
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, remote code execution (depending on the context).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation using Dingo's validation features or custom validation logic.
        *   Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
        *   Validate data types and formats.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the API automatically deserializes request bodies (e.g., JSON, XML) without proper safeguards, malicious payloads can lead to code execution.
    *   **How API Contributes:** Dingo likely handles deserialization of request bodies. If not configured securely or if underlying libraries have vulnerabilities, it contributes to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Sending a crafted JSON payload that exploits a vulnerability in the underlying deserialization library to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid automatic deserialization of untrusted data if possible.
        *   Use secure deserialization libraries and keep them updated.
        *   Implement whitelisting of allowed classes during deserialization.
        *   Consider signing or encrypting serialized data.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Response Headers](./attack_surfaces/insecure_response_headers.md)

*   **Description:** Missing or misconfigured security headers can leave the application vulnerable to various client-side attacks.
    *   **How API Contributes:** Dingo's response handling allows setting headers. If developers don't configure appropriate security headers, the API contributes to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Missing `Strict-Transport-Security` header allows man-in-the-middle attacks to downgrade HTTPS to HTTP. Missing `X-Frame-Options` allows clickjacking attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure to clickjacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle attacks, and other browser-based vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Dingo to set appropriate security headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy`.
        *   Regularly review and update security header configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Flaws within Dingo's Context](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_flaws_within_dingo's_context.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how authentication and authorization are implemented within the Dingo API can lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **How API Contributes:** Dingo might provide middleware or mechanisms for implementing authentication and authorization. Flaws in this implementation directly expose the API.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication middleware in Dingo that incorrectly verifies JWT signatures, allowing attackers to forge tokens. Or, authorization logic not correctly applied to all Dingo routes.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use well-vetted and secure authentication and authorization libraries or patterns.
        *   Thoroughly test authentication and authorization logic for all API endpoints.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access.
        *   Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassable Rate Limiting](./attack_surfaces/bypassable_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:** If rate limiting is implemented using Dingo but can be easily bypassed, it fails to protect against abuse.
    *   **How API Contributes:** Dingo might offer features for rate limiting. If these features are not configured correctly or have implementation flaws, the API remains vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Rate limiting based solely on IP address can be bypassed by using multiple IP addresses.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, brute-force attacks, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust rate limiting based on multiple factors (e.g., IP address, user ID, API key).
        *   Carefully configure rate limit thresholds.
        *   Test rate limiting mechanisms to ensure they cannot be easily bypassed.
