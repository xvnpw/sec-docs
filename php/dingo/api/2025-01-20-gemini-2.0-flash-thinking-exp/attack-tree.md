## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (if any in Dingo or examples) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_any_in_dingo_or_examples___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to log in to the application or access the API using default usernames and passwords that might be present in the Dingo API itself, example configurations, or related documentation.
**Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker full access to the application's functionalities and data, potentially leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak or Missing Authentication Mechanisms [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_or_missing_authentication_mechanisms__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application using the Dingo API lacks proper authentication mechanisms, uses weak authentication methods (e.g., basic authentication over HTTP), or has vulnerabilities in its authentication implementation. Attackers can bypass authentication checks or exploit weaknesses to gain unauthorized access.
**Impact:** Attackers can access protected resources and functionalities without providing valid credentials, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Privilege Escalation [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/privilege_escalation__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** After gaining initial access (potentially with limited privileges), an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the authorization logic to elevate their privileges. This could involve manipulating API calls, exploiting flaws in role-based access control, or bypassing authorization checks.
**Impact:** The attacker gains access to resources and functionalities that should be restricted to higher-privileged users, allowing them to perform administrative actions, access sensitive data, or disrupt the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in API endpoints [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_api_endpoints__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** API endpoints use predictable identifiers (e.g., database IDs) to access resources. Attackers can manipulate these identifiers in API requests to access or modify resources belonging to other users without proper authorization.
**Impact:** Attackers can access or modify sensitive data belonging to other users, potentially leading to data breaches, privacy violations, and unauthorized actions on behalf of other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing or Improper Authorization Checks [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/missing_or_improper_authorization_checks__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application using the Dingo API fails to properly verify user permissions before granting access to specific resources or functionalities. Attackers can exploit this by directly accessing API endpoints or performing actions without the necessary authorization.
**Impact:** Attackers can access sensitive data or perform actions they are not authorized for, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak API Keys [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/leak_api_keys__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** API keys used to authenticate with the Dingo API or other services are unintentionally exposed. This can happen through various means, such as:
*   Embedding keys in client-side code.
*   Committing keys to public repositories.
*   Storing keys insecurely in configuration files.
*   Accidental disclosure in logs or error messages.
**Impact:** Attackers who obtain leaked API keys can impersonate legitimate users or applications, gaining full access to the API's functionalities and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [NoSQL Injection (if Dingo interacts with NoSQL databases) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/nosql_injection__if_dingo_interacts_with_nosql_databases___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application using Dingo interacts with a NoSQL database and doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input used in database queries, attackers can inject malicious NoSQL queries.
**Impact:** Successful injection can allow attackers to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary code on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection (if Dingo processes user-supplied commands) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__if_dingo_processes_user-supplied_commands___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses the Dingo API to process user-supplied commands without proper sanitization or validation, attackers can inject malicious commands that will be executed on the server's operating system.
**Impact:** Successful command injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in Dingo's dependencies [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_dingo's_dependencies__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Dingo API relies on various third-party libraries and packages. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application. This often involves identifying vulnerable dependencies and crafting specific requests or payloads to trigger the vulnerability.
**Impact:** Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution, unauthorized access, and denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Session Management (if Dingo handles sessions) [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_session_management__if_dingo_handles_sessions___critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application using the Dingo API implements session management insecurely. This can involve:
*   Using weak or predictable session IDs.
*   Not properly expiring sessions.
*   Storing session information insecurely.
*   Being vulnerable to session fixation or session hijacking attacks.
**Impact:** Attackers can steal or hijack legitimate user sessions, allowing them to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts and data.
