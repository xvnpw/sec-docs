## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application via phpdotenv [CRITICAL NODE]
    * AND: Exploit phpdotenv Weakness
        * OR: Manipulate .env File [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Gain Write Access to Web Server [HIGH RISK PATH - START]
                * Exploit Web Server Vulnerability (e.g., file upload, directory traversal)
                * Compromise Server Credentials
            * Vulnerable File Permissions
                * Web server user has write access to .env [HIGH RISK PATH - END]
        * OR: Exploit .env Parsing Vulnerabilities
            * Inject Malicious Values [HIGH RISK PATH - START]
                * Inject SQL injection payloads into database credentials [CRITICAL NODE]
                * Inject command injection payloads into variables used in system calls [CRITICAL NODE]
        * OR: Abuse Default Behavior/Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Sensitive Data in .env in Production [HIGH RISK PATH - START]
                * Expose .env file via misconfigured web server (e.g., no `.htaccess` or similar) [CRITICAL NODE]
    * AND: Application Relies on Loaded Variables [HIGH RISK PATH - END]
        * Application uses environment variables for:
            * Database Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]
            * API Keys [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Secret Keys (e.g., for encryption, JWT) [CRITICAL NODE]
