# Attack Surface Analysis for vlucas/phpdotenv

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Access to `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_access_to___env__file.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized read access to the `.env` file, which typically contains sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.

**How phpdotenv Contributes:** `phpdotenv`'s core function is to read and parse the `.env` file. This action makes the file a target, and if permissions are misconfigured, `phpdotenv` facilitates the exposure of these secrets by needing to access the file.

**Example:** A misconfigured web server allows direct access to the application's root directory, where the `.env` file is located. An attacker can directly request the file via a web browser, and `phpdotenv`'s need to read this file means the secrets are exposed.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application's sensitive data and potentially access to connected services (databases, APIs).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict File System Permissions:** Ensure the `.env` file has read permissions only for the user account running the web server or PHP process. This directly limits who `phpdotenv` can operate on behalf of.
* **Store `.env` Outside Web Root:** Place the `.env` file in a directory that is not directly accessible via the web server. This prevents direct web access, regardless of `phpdotenv`'s actions.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Unexpected Syntax in `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_unexpected_syntax_in___env__file.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the `.env` file can introduce malicious or unexpected syntax that might be interpreted in unintended ways by the application or the underlying system *due to how the application uses the variables loaded by phpdotenv*.

**How phpdotenv Contributes:** `phpdotenv` parses the `.env` file and makes the values available as environment variables. While `phpdotenv` itself might not directly execute malicious code, it facilitates the loading of potentially harmful values that the application might then use insecurely.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the `.env` file to include a value like `DATABASE_PASSWORD='$(rm -rf /)'` (highly dangerous and unlikely to work directly due to how environment variables are typically handled, but illustrates the principle of injecting commands). If the application naively uses this variable in a shell command, it could lead to severe consequences because `phpdotenv` loaded this malicious value.

**Impact:** Potentially arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unexpected application behavior depending on how the loaded variables are used.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Deployment Practices:** Ensure only authorized personnel and processes can modify the `.env` file, limiting the ability to inject malicious syntax that `phpdotenv` would then load.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize environment variables loaded by `phpdotenv` *before* using them in any sensitive operations (e.g., shell commands, database queries). This mitigates the risk of the application misinterpreting malicious syntax loaded by `phpdotenv`.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Injection through `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_injection_through___env__file.md)

**Description:** An attacker modifies the `.env` file to inject or manipulate environment variables that are then used by the application in a vulnerable way.

**How phpdotenv Contributes:** `phpdotenv`'s primary function is to load these variables into the environment. This makes the `.env` file a direct point of control for influencing the application's runtime environment.

**Example:** An attacker changes the `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` variable in the `.env` file to a known weak hash. If the application uses this variable for authentication without proper checks, the attacker could gain administrative access because `phpdotenv` loaded this manipulated value.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, bypassing security checks, data manipulation, or other application-specific vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Treat Environment Variables as Untrusted Input:** Always validate and sanitize environment variables loaded by `phpdotenv` before using them. Do not assume the integrity or safety of values loaded by `phpdotenv`.
* **Avoid Storing Sensitive Credentials Directly:** Consider using more secure methods for managing sensitive credentials, such as dedicated secrets management systems, rather than relying solely on `.env` files loaded by `phpdotenv`.
