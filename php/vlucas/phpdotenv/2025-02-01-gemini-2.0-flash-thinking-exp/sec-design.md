# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The phpdotenv project aims to simplify the management of environment variables for PHP applications.
  - It promotes the separation of configuration from code, making applications more portable and easier to deploy across different environments (development, staging, production).
  - The primary goal is to enhance developer experience and streamline configuration management in PHP projects.
- Business Risks:
  - Misconfiguration due to incorrect or missing environment variables can lead to application malfunctions or unexpected behavior.
  - Exposure of sensitive information if `.env` files are not properly secured or accidentally committed to version control.
  - Dependency on an external library introduces a potential supply chain risk, although phpdotenv is a widely used and mature library.
  - Incorrect handling of environment variables within the application code can lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly validated and sanitized.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Reliance on underlying operating system and server security for file system permissions to protect `.env` files. Implemented at the server level.
  - security control: Secure software development lifecycle practices for projects using phpdotenv, including code reviews and testing. Implemented by development teams using the library.
  - security control: Usage of HTTPS for web applications using phpdotenv to protect data in transit, including potentially environment variables used in the application logic. Implemented at the web server and application level.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Risk of accidental exposure of `.env` files if not properly managed in version control or backups. Mitigation relies on developer awareness and best practices.
  - accepted risk: Risk of misconfiguration if environment variables are not correctly set or interpreted. Mitigation relies on testing and validation within the application.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on the phpdotenv library itself. Mitigation relies on community trust and monitoring for known vulnerabilities in the library.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated checks to prevent `.env` files from being committed to version control systems. Implemented in CI/CD pipelines and developer workflows.
  - security control: Regularly scan dependencies, including phpdotenv, for known vulnerabilities using tools like dependency-check or similar. Implemented in CI/CD pipelines.
  - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization for environment variables within the application code to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Implemented in application code.
  - security control: Consider encrypting sensitive data within `.env` files or using more secure configuration management solutions for highly sensitive environments. Implemented at the application and deployment level.
  - security control: Implement least privilege principles for access to `.env` files and environment variables within the application and deployment environment. Implemented at the operating system and application level.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to phpdotenv library itself. Authentication is a responsibility of the applications using phpdotenv.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to phpdotenv library itself. Authorization is a responsibility of the applications using phpdotenv.
  - Input Validation: Applications using phpdotenv must validate and sanitize environment variables before using them to prevent injection vulnerabilities. This is a critical security requirement for applications using the library.
  - Cryptography: phpdotenv itself does not handle cryptography. If sensitive data is stored in environment variables, applications should consider encrypting this data at rest or in transit, but this is outside the scope of the phpdotenv library itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - The critical business processes are those supported by the PHP applications that utilize phpdotenv for configuration. The security of these applications and their configurations directly impacts the business processes they enable.
  - If the application is a customer-facing web application, the critical business process is serving customers and maintaining application availability and data integrity.
  - If the application is an internal tool, the critical business process is supporting internal operations and ensuring data confidentiality and integrity for internal users.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data protected by this design depends on the environment variables stored in `.env` files.
  - Environment variables can contain sensitive information such as:
    - Database credentials (usernames, passwords, connection strings).
    - API keys and secrets for external services.
    - Encryption keys or salts.
    - Application-specific sensitive configuration parameters.
  - The sensitivity level can range from moderate (if only non-critical configuration is stored) to high (if highly sensitive credentials or secrets are stored). It is crucial to treat `.env` files and environment variables as potentially containing highly sensitive data and apply appropriate security controls.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What type of applications will be using phpdotenv? (e.g., web applications, APIs, background workers, CLI tools). This will influence the deployment architecture and threat model.
  - What is the sensitivity of the data that will be stored in environment variables? This will determine the required level of security controls for `.env` files and environment variable handling.
  - What is the deployment environment for the applications using phpdotenv? (e.g., cloud, on-premise, hybrid). This will impact the deployment architecture and available security services.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that the applications using phpdotenv must adhere to? This will dictate additional security controls and considerations.
  - What is the organization's risk appetite? A higher risk appetite might lead to accepting more risks related to configuration management, while a lower risk appetite will require stricter security measures.
- Assumptions:
  - It is assumed that phpdotenv is used in typical PHP application development scenarios for managing configuration across different environments.
  - It is assumed that environment variables may contain sensitive information, requiring appropriate security measures to protect `.env` files and handle environment variables securely.
  - It is assumed that applications using phpdotenv will be deployed in standard server environments, either traditional servers or containerized environments.
  - It is assumed that the organization values security and wants to implement reasonable security controls to protect their applications and data.
  - It is assumed that the development team follows secure software development lifecycle practices.
