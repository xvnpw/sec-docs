# Threat Model Analysis for vlucas/phpdotenv

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables via `.env` File in Version Control](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables_via___env__file_in_version_control.md)

### Description:

- **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains access to a version control repository and obtains the `.env` file if it was mistakenly committed.
- **How:** Developers might forget to exclude `.env` from version control, leading to accidental commits.

### Impact:

- **Impact:** Confidentiality breach. Exposed credentials can lead to full application compromise, data theft, and unauthorized access to related services.

### phpdotenv Component Affected:

Usage Pattern / Configuration (how developers use `.env` files with phpdotenv).

### Risk Severity:

High

### Mitigation Strategies:

- Strictly use `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files.
- Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent `.env` commits.
- Conduct code reviews for accidental `.env` inclusion.
- Educate developers on secure `.env` handling.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables via World-Readable `.env` File on Server](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables_via_world-readable___env__file_on_server.md)

### Description:

- **Attacker Action:** An attacker with server access reads the `.env` file if file permissions are overly permissive.
- **How:** System misconfiguration or improper deployment practices result in world-readable `.env` files.

### Impact:

- **Impact:** Confidentiality breach. Exposed credentials allow attackers to compromise the server, application, and backend systems.

### phpdotenv Component Affected:

Deployment / Server Configuration (how `.env` file permissions are set on the server).

### Risk Severity:

High

### Mitigation Strategies:

- Set restrictive file permissions on `.env` (e.g., `chmod 600 .env`).
- Store `.env` outside the web server's document root.
- Regularly audit server file permissions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables via Web Server Misconfiguration (Serving `.env` file)](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables_via_web_server_misconfiguration__serving___env__file_.md)

### Description:

- **Attacker Action:** An attacker directly requests the `.env` file via the web server if misconfigured.
- **How:** Web server fails to block access to dotfiles, serving `.env` as a static file.

### Impact:

- **Impact:** Confidentiality breach. Direct download of `.env` exposes all secrets, leading to critical application and infrastructure compromise.

### phpdotenv Component Affected:

Deployment / Web Server Configuration (web server's handling of static files and dotfiles).

### Risk Severity:

Critical

### Mitigation Strategies:

- Configure web server to explicitly deny access to `.env` files.
- Regularly audit web server configurations for security.
- Implement web server hardening best practices.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in phpdotenv](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_phpdotenv.md)

### Description:

- **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability found within the `phpdotenv` library itself.
- **How:**  `phpdotenv` library contains a vulnerability (e.g., in parsing logic) that attackers can trigger.

### Impact:

- **Impact:**  Potentially critical, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the vulnerability. Could lead to full server and application compromise.

### phpdotenv Component Affected:

Library itself (core parsing logic, or any vulnerable function).

### Risk Severity:

High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

### Mitigation Strategies:

- Regularly update `phpdotenv` to the latest version.
- Monitor security advisories for `phpdotenv`.
- Use dependency scanning tools to detect vulnerable versions.
