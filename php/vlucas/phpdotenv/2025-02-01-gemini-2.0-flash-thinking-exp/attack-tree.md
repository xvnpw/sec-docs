## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit .env File Exposure (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit__env_file_exposure__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The primary high-risk path is the exposure of the `.env` file itself. If an attacker can access the contents of this file, they immediately gain access to sensitive configuration details of the application.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Critical Impact:**  The `.env` file typically contains database credentials, API keys, secret keys, and other sensitive information. Access to this data allows for immediate and severe compromise of the application and its related services.
    *   **Medium to High Likelihood:** Web server misconfigurations are a common vulnerability. Backup files are often unintentionally left in accessible locations. Path traversal and LFI vulnerabilities, while less frequent than misconfigurations, are still realistic attack vectors in web applications.
    *   **Low to Medium Effort & Skill:** Exploiting web server misconfigurations or accessing backup files requires relatively low effort and skill. Path traversal and LFI require slightly more skill but are still within the reach of many attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Direct Access to .env File (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__direct_access_to__env_file__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly request the `.env` file via HTTP, hoping the web server is misconfigured to serve it.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Critical Impact:** Direct access leads to immediate exposure of all secrets in the `.env` file.
    *   **Medium Likelihood:** Web server misconfigurations serving static files incorrectly are not uncommon, especially in default setups or after rushed deployments.
    *   **Very Low Effort & Skill:**  Requires only a web browser or simple tools like `curl` to request the file.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Web server serves .env file directly (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__web_server_serves__env_file_directly__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Web server configuration is missing rules to deny access to `.env` files, allowing them to be served as static content.
*   **Why Critical:**
    *   **Critical Impact:** Direct exposure of `.env` content.
    *   **Medium Likelihood:**  A common misconfiguration, especially if developers are not aware of the security implications or rely on default server setups.
    *   **Very Low Effort & Skill:**  Exploiting this requires only requesting the file.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Access to Backup or Temporary .env Files (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__access_to_backup_or_temporary__env_files__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to access common backup file names (e.g., `.env.backup`, `.env~`) or predictable temporary file locations, hoping these files contain sensitive information.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Critical Impact:** Backup and temporary files often contain the same sensitive information as the original `.env` file.
    *   **Low Likelihood:**  Less likely than direct access to the primary `.env` file, but still plausible if developers or systems administrators are not careful with file management.
    *   **Very Low to Medium Effort & Skill:** Accessing backup files is very low effort. Accessing temporary files might require slightly more effort depending on their location and predictability.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Access .env.backup, .env~, or similar backup files via web server (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__access__env_backup___env~__or_similar_backup_files_via_web_server__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Backup files with predictable names are left within the web root and are accessible via HTTP requests.
*   **Why Critical:**
    *   **Critical Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information from backup files.
    *   **Low Likelihood:** Depends on development and deployment practices, but accidental backups in web root are possible.
    *   **Very Low Effort & Skill:**  Requires only requesting the file with the backup filename.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1.2. Overwrite critical environment variables to manipulate application behavior (Part of Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_2__overwrite_critical_environment_variables_to_manipulate_application_behavior__part_of_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  If an attacker gains control over the `.env` file content (through other means, not directly through phpdotenv vulnerabilities), they can modify the values of environment variables loaded by phpdotenv.
*   **Why Critical (when achieved):**
    *   **Critical Impact:** Overwriting critical environment variables allows attackers to:
        *   **2.2.1.2.1. Modify database credentials to gain database access (Critical Node):** Gain full access to the application's database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential further compromise.
        *   **2.2.1.2.2. Modify API keys to access external services (Critical Node):**  Abuse external services connected to the application, potentially leading to data breaches in external systems, financial losses, or reputational damage.
        *   **2.2.1.2.3. Modify application settings to bypass security checks or gain admin access (Critical Node):**  Bypass authentication, authorization, or other security mechanisms within the application, potentially gaining administrative privileges or access to restricted functionalities.
    *   **High Likelihood (if .env control is achieved):** Once an attacker controls the `.env` file, manipulating variables is trivial.
    *   **Very Low Effort & Skill (after .env control):** Modifying the file content is a simple task.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1.2.1. Modify database credentials to gain database access (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_2_1__modify_database_credentials_to_gain_database_access__critical_node_.md)

        *   **2.2.1.2.2. Modify API keys to access external services (Critical Node):**  Abuse external services connected to the application, potentially leading to data breaches in external systems, financial losses, or reputational damage.
