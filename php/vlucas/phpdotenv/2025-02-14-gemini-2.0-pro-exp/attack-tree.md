## Attack Tree Path: [[G] Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information in .env `[!]`](./attack_tree_paths/_g__gain_unauthorized_access_to_sensitive_information_in__env___!__.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to obtain the contents of the `.env` file, which contains sensitive configuration data such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.
*   **Likelihood:** (Overall, dependent on the specific path)
*   **Impact:** Very High.  Exposure of these secrets can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Effort:** Varies depending on the attack path.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the attack path.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1] Direct Access to .env File](./attack_tree_paths/_1__direct_access_to__env_file.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to directly download the `.env` file via a web request.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1] Web Server Misconfiguration (Exposes .env to the web) `[!]` ---> [G]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1__web_server_misconfiguration__exposes__env_to_the_web____!___---__g_.md)

*   **Description:** The web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) is not configured to deny access to files starting with a dot (`.`).  This allows anyone to access the `.env` file by simply requesting it via a URL (e.g., `http://example.com/.env`).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. This is a common misconfiguration, especially among less experienced developers.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Direct and complete access to all secrets in the `.env` file.
*   **Effort:** Very Low.  The attacker only needs to try a standard URL.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low.  No specialized skills are required.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  The request will appear in web server access logs, but it might be overlooked if logs aren't actively monitored or if the attacker uses a less obvious URL.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3] Exploiting Incorrect Usage of phpdotenv `[!]`](./attack_tree_paths/_3__exploiting_incorrect_usage_of_phpdotenv___!__.md)

*  **Description:** This branch encompasses vulnerabilities arising from how developers use (or misuse) the `phpdotenv` library and handle `.env` files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.1] .env file in Production Environment](./attack_tree_paths/_3_1___env_file_in_production_environment.md)

*   **Description:** While `phpdotenv` is useful for development, using `.env` files directly in a production environment is discouraged. Production systems should use proper environment variable setting mechanisms. The presence of a `.env` file in production increases the attack surface.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Developers may forget to remove the file or may not be aware of best practices.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Exposes production credentials if the file is accessible.
*   **Effort:** Very Low. The attacker simply needs to check for the file's existence.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low. No special skills are needed.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High. Requires proactive checks and audits to ensure `.env` files are not present in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.2] .env file committed to public repo `[!]` ---> [G]](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2___env_file_committed_to_public_repo___!___---__g_.md)

*   **Description:** The `.env` file, containing sensitive credentials, is accidentally committed to a public version control repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). This makes the credentials publicly accessible to anyone.
*   **Likelihood:** High. This is a surprisingly frequent mistake, often due to oversight or lack of awareness.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Immediate and complete exposure of all secrets in the `.env` file.
*   **Effort:** Very Low. Attackers can use automated tools (e.g., `trufflehog`, GitHub's secret scanning) to find exposed secrets in public repositories.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low. No specialized skills are required.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low. Many tools and services exist to detect this specific issue.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.3] .env file loaded in insecure location (web root) `[!]` ---> [1.1] ... ---> [G]](./attack_tree_paths/_3_3___env_file_loaded_in_insecure_location__web_root____!___---__1_1______---__g_.md)

*   **Description:** The `.env` file is placed within the web root directory, making it potentially accessible via a direct web request (especially if [1.1] is also true).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Developers might not fully understand the implications of placing files within the web root.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Significantly increases the risk of direct access to the `.env` file.
*   **Effort:** Very Low. The attacker simply needs to try accessing the file via a URL.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low. No specialized skills are required.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Similar to [1.1], the request would appear in web server logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.3.1] No .htaccess protection (Apache)](./attack_tree_paths/_3_3_1__no__htaccess_protection__apache_.md)

*    **Description:** If using Apache, and the `.env` is in webroot, but there is no `.htaccess` file to protect files starting with `.`, then the file is exposed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** Very High.
*   **Effort:** Very Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.3.2] Web Server Misconfiguration (Nginx, etc.) `[!]`](./attack_tree_paths/_3_3_2__web_server_misconfiguration__nginx__etc_____!__.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to [3.3.1], but for other web servers like Nginx. Each server has its own configuration for access control. If the server is not configured to deny access to files starting with a dot, the `.env` file is vulnerable.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Misconfigurations are common.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Direct access to the `.env` file.
*   **Effort:** Very Low. The attacker just needs to try a URL.
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low. No specialized skills are needed.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. The request would appear in web server logs.
