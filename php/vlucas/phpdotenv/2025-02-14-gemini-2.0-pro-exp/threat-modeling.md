# Threat Model Analysis for vlucas/phpdotenv

## Threat: [.env File Exposure via Web Server Misconfiguration](./threats/_env_file_exposure_via_web_server_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** `.env` File Exposure via Web Server Misconfiguration

    *   **Description:** An attacker directly accesses the `.env` file through a web browser by requesting its URL (e.g., `https://example.com/.env`). This occurs if the webserver (Apache, Nginx) is not configured to deny access to files starting with a dot (`.`) or if the `.env` file is placed within the webroot and accessible. `phpdotenv`'s reliance on this file for configuration makes it a direct target.
    *   **Impact:** Complete disclosure of all sensitive information stored in the `.env` file, including database credentials, API keys, and application secrets. This can lead to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected phpdotenv Component:**  The `.env` file itself, and the overall concept of storing secrets in a file loaded by `phpdotenv`.  The library's design choice to use a file is the core issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Web Server Configuration:** Configure the webserver (Apache, Nginx) to explicitly deny access to `.env` files (and all files starting with a dot).
        *   **File Placement:** Store the `.env` file *outside* the webroot (document root). This is the most secure option.

## Threat: [.env File Inclusion via File Inclusion Vulnerability](./threats/_env_file_inclusion_via_file_inclusion_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** `.env` File Inclusion via File Inclusion Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** Although the vulnerability itself is in the application code (not `phpdotenv`), the attacker exploits a Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability to read the contents of the `.env` file, which `phpdotenv` uses.  `phpdotenv`'s reliance on a file makes it a target.
    *   **Impact:**  Disclosure of all sensitive information in the `.env` file, leading to potential system compromise.
    *   **Affected phpdotenv Component:** The `.env` file and the library's reliance on it. The vulnerability is in the application, but `phpdotenv`'s file-based approach makes the `.env` file a valuable target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Prevent LFI/RFI vulnerabilities in the application code.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the web server user has minimal file system permissions.

## Threat: [.env File Modification via Server Compromise](./threats/_env_file_modification_via_server_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** `.env` File Modification via Server Compromise

    *   **Description:** While this is a general server security issue, the `.env` file, used by `phpdotenv`, becomes a high-value target. An attacker gains server access and modifies the `.env` file to change credentials, alter application settings, or inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete control over the application's behavior and access to all connected resources.
    *   **Affected phpdotenv Component:** The `.env` file and the library's reliance on it. The vulnerability is a server issue, but the `.env` file is a key target due to `phpdotenv`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Server Security:** Implement robust server security measures.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detect unauthorized changes to the `.env` file.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit web server user permissions.

## Threat: [.env File Leakage via Source Code Repository](./threats/_env_file_leakage_via_source_code_repository.md)

*   **Threat:** `.env` File Leakage via Source Code Repository

    *   **Description:** The `.env` file, central to `phpdotenv`'s operation, is accidentally committed to a source code repository.  Anyone with access to the repository can view the sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**  Disclosure of all sensitive information in the `.env` file.
    *   **Affected phpdotenv Component:** The `.env` file and the practice of using it, as encouraged by `phpdotenv`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **.gitignore:**  Always include `.env` in the `.gitignore` file.
        *   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Prevent accidental commits of `.env` files.
        *   **Repository Scanning:** Scan for accidentally committed secrets.

## Threat: [.env File Tampering to Enable Debug Mode](./threats/_env_file_tampering_to_enable_debug_mode.md)

*   **Threat:** `.env` File Tampering to Enable Debug Mode

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `.env` file, used by `phpdotenv`, to set `APP_DEBUG=true` (or similar) in production, exposing sensitive information through error messages.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information through verbose error messages.
    *   **Affected phpdotenv Component:** The `.env` file and the application's reliance on it for configuration, as facilitated by `phpdotenv`. The `env()` function or similar.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detect unauthorized changes.
        *   **Server-Level Environment Variables:** Set `APP_DEBUG=false` in server configuration, overriding the `.env` file.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Prevent sensitive information exposure in errors.

## Threat: [.env File Used for Authorization Decisions](./threats/_env_file_used_for_authorization_decisions.md)

*   **Threat:** `.env` File Used for Authorization Decisions

    *   **Description:** The application (incorrectly) uses environment variables loaded from the `.env` file (via `phpdotenv`) for authorization.  An attacker modifying the `.env` file could elevate privileges.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected phpdotenv Component:** The `.env` file and the application's (mis)use of it, facilitated by `phpdotenv`'s `env()` function or similar.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Do Not Use Environment Variables for Authorization:** Use a database-backed authorization system.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If environment variables *must* be used, validate them thoroughly.
