# Attack Surface Analysis for vlucas/phpdotenv

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of sensitive environment variables due to the `.env` file being publicly accessible.](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables_due_to_the___env__file_being_publicly_accessible.md)

* **Description:** Exposure of sensitive environment variables due to the `.env` file being publicly accessible.
    * **How phpdotenv Contributes:** `phpdotenv` relies on the existence of a `.env` file to load configuration secrets. If this file is accessible via the web server, its contents are exposed.
    * **Example:** A user navigates to `https://example.com/.env` and can download the file containing database credentials and API keys.
    * **Impact:**  Full compromise of application secrets, potentially leading to unauthorized database access, API abuse, and other security breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the `.env` file is located outside the web root.
        * Configure the web server to explicitly deny access to the `.env` file.
        * Use proper deployment strategies that don't copy the `.env` file to the production web server.

## Attack Surface: [Potential manipulation of environment variables if the `.env` file is writable by the web server process.](./attack_surfaces/potential_manipulation_of_environment_variables_if_the___env__file_is_writable_by_the_web_server_pro_3cb05e50.md)

* **Description:** Potential manipulation of environment variables if the `.env` file is writable by the web server process.
    * **How phpdotenv Contributes:** If the web server has write permissions to the directory containing the `.env` file, an attacker who gains control of the server could modify the file that `phpdotenv` reads.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain write access to the web server and modifies the `.env` file to change database credentials or inject malicious API keys.
    * **Impact:**  Complete compromise of application configuration, allowing attackers to control application behavior, access sensitive data, or pivot to other systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the web server process has read-only access to the `.env` file.
        * Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to the `.env` file.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring file system permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Security risks associated with including external files using `RepositoryBuilder::addFile` with potentially untrusted paths.](./attack_surfaces/security_risks_associated_with_including_external_files_using__repositorybuilderaddfile__with_potent_90a4166d.md)

* **Description:** Security risks associated with including external files using `RepositoryBuilder::addFile` with potentially untrusted paths.
    * **How phpdotenv Contributes:** `phpdotenv` allows loading environment variables from multiple files using `RepositoryBuilder::addFile`. If the file paths used with this method are influenced by user input or external sources, it can lead to vulnerabilities when `phpdotenv` processes these files.
    * **Example:** An attacker manipulates a request parameter that is used to construct the file path for `RepositoryBuilder::addFile`, causing the application to load environment variables from a malicious file.
    * **Impact:**  Information disclosure (loading secrets from unintended files), potential code execution if the loaded file contains malicious content interpreted as environment variables.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using user-controlled input directly in file paths for `RepositoryBuilder::addFile`.
        * Sanitize and validate any external input used to determine file paths.
        * Restrict the allowed file paths for `RepositoryBuilder::addFile` to a predefined whitelist.
