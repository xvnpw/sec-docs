## Attack Tree Path: [***Sub-goal 1.1: Gain Write Access to .env File***](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_1_1_gain_write_access_to__env_file.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Sub-goal 1.1: Gain Write Access to .env File:**
    *   This is a critical point because successfully gaining write access allows the attacker to directly manipulate the application's core configuration. This unlocks numerous possibilities for further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [**1.1.1: Exploit Web Server Misconfiguration**](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_exploit_web_server_misconfiguration.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **1.1.1: Exploit Web Server Misconfiguration:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Identify misconfigured web server settings (e.g., incorrect file permissions, writable application directories).
        *   Utilize methods like PUT requests (if enabled and improperly secured) or leverage vulnerabilities allowing file uploads to write to the `.env` file location.
        *   Exploit directory traversal vulnerabilities to navigate to the `.env` file's location and overwrite it.

## Attack Tree Path: [**1.1.2: Exploit Vulnerability in Application Logic**](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_exploit_vulnerability_in_application_logic.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **1.1.2: Exploit Vulnerability in Application Logic:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Identify vulnerabilities within the application code that allow file writing or manipulation.
        *   Exploit file upload vulnerabilities to upload a malicious `.env` file or a script that modifies the existing one.
        *   Leverage path traversal vulnerabilities within application logic to write to the `.env` file.
        *   Exploit other application flaws that can be chained to achieve file writing capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Sub-goal 1.2: Introduce Malicious Variables***](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_1_2_introduce_malicious_variables.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Sub-goal 1.2: Introduce Malicious Variables:**
    *   This is the direct action following successful write access. By introducing malicious variables, the attacker can directly impact the application's behavior, security, and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**1.2.1: Overwrite Sensitive Configuration**](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_overwrite_sensitive_configuration.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **1.2.1: Overwrite Sensitive Configuration:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Once write access to the `.env` file is obtained, identify the names of environment variables containing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys).
        *   Modify the values of these variables within the `.env` file to attacker-controlled values.

## Attack Tree Path: [**1.2.1.1: Modify Database Credentials**](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1_modify_database_credentials.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **1.2.1.1: Modify Database Credentials:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Overwrite the environment variables containing database host, username, and password with credentials controlled by the attacker.
        *   This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application's database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [**1.2.1.2: Alter API Keys or Secrets**](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_2_alter_api_keys_or_secrets.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **1.2.1.2: Alter API Keys or Secrets:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Replace legitimate API keys or secret keys stored in environment variables with attacker-controlled ones.
        *   This grants the attacker unauthorized access to external services or resources that the application interacts with, potentially leading to data breaches or misuse of those services.

## Attack Tree Path: [**1.2.2: Inject Malicious Code or Payloads**](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_inject_malicious_code_or_payloads.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **1.2.2: Inject Malicious Code or Payloads:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Introduce environment variables with values that, when used by the application, can be interpreted as executable code.
        *   This could involve injecting shell commands into variables used in `exec()` or similar functions, or injecting code snippets into template engine variables.

## Attack Tree Path: [**1.2.2.1: Introduce Variables Interpreted as Code**](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1_introduce_variables_interpreted_as_code.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **1.2.2.1: Introduce Variables Interpreted as Code:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Craft environment variable values that, when processed by the application (e.g., in shell commands, `eval()` statements, or template engines), will execute attacker-controlled code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Sub-goal 3.1: Exploit Vulnerabilities Where Environment Variables are Used***](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_3_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_where_environment_variables_are_used.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Sub-goal 3.1: Exploit Vulnerabilities Where Environment Variables are Used:**
    *   This highlights the critical dependency on how the application handles the environment variables loaded by phpdotenv. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate these variables, it becomes vulnerable to various injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [**3.1.1: Command Injection via Unsanitized Variables**](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_command_injection_via_unsanitized_variables.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **3.1.1: Command Injection via Unsanitized Variables:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Identify instances in the application code where environment variables are directly used in shell commands without proper sanitization or escaping.
        *   Craft malicious environment variable values containing shell metacharacters or commands that, when executed, will perform actions desired by the attacker (e.g., executing system commands, creating backdoors).

## Attack Tree Path: [**3.1.2: SQL Injection via Database Credentials**](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_2_sql_injection_via_database_credentials.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **3.1.2: SQL Injection via Database Credentials:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Identify database connection logic that directly uses environment variables for credentials without proper escaping or parameterized queries.
        *   If an attacker can modify these environment variables (as described in previous high-risk paths), they can inject malicious SQL code into the connection string or credential parameters, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [**3.1.4: Insecure Deserialization via Variable Content**](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_4_insecure_deserialization_via_variable_content.md)

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **3.1.4: Insecure Deserialization via Variable Content:**
    *   Attack Vector:
        *   Identify scenarios where the application retrieves data from environment variables and attempts to deserialize it (e.g., using `unserialize()` in PHP).
        *   If an attacker can control the content of these environment variables, they can inject malicious serialized objects that, upon deserialization, trigger arbitrary code execution on the server. This often requires knowledge of the application's classes and potential vulnerabilities within them (gadgets).
