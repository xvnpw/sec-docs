Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Sentry-PHP, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** DSN (Data Source Name) Exposure
    *   **Description:** The DSN contains sensitive credentials (public and secret keys) required to authenticate with the Sentry project. If exposed, unauthorized individuals can send data to your Sentry project.
    *   **How Sentry-PHP Contributes:** Sentry-PHP requires the DSN to be configured for it to function and send error reports. Improper storage or handling of this configuration directly exposes the DSN.
    *   **Example:** Hardcoding the DSN directly in the application code and committing it to a public Git repository.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Sending of false or malicious error reports, potentially obscuring real issues.
        *   Resource exhaustion on the Sentry project due to excessive or fabricated events.
        *   Potential data injection into Sentry if it doesn't properly sanitize incoming data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the DSN securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
        *   Avoid hardcoding the DSN in the application code.
        *   Restrict access to the DSN configuration files.
        *   Regularly rotate Sentry project keys if a breach is suspected.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Configuration Options
    *   **Description:**  Certain configuration options in Sentry-PHP, if not carefully considered, can increase the risk of exposing sensitive data or creating vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Sentry-PHP Contributes:** Sentry-PHP provides various configuration options to customize its behavior. Incorrectly setting these options within the `Sentry\ClientBuilder` or through other configuration methods directly leads to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Enabling `send_default_pii` without understanding the implications, leading to the transmission of personally identifiable information (PII) to Sentry.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Leakage of sensitive user data to the Sentry platform.
        *   Violation of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
        *   Increased attack surface due to overly permissive configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and understand the implications of each Sentry-PHP configuration option before enabling it.
        *   Disable `send_default_pii` unless absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of the data being sent.
        *   Carefully configure sampling rates to avoid excessive data collection.
        *   Implement robust `before_send` and `before_breadcrumb` callbacks with proper validation and sanitization within the Sentry-PHP integration.

*   **Attack Surface:** Sensitive Data Leakage in Captured Data
    *   **Description:**  Sentry-PHP can capture various data points beyond the error message itself, potentially including sensitive information if not configured carefully.
    *   **How Sentry-PHP Contributes:** Sentry-PHP's features for capturing context data, user information, request details, and more, directly contribute to this attack surface if not configured with security in mind. The library's default behavior might capture more data than intended.
    *   **Example:** Capturing the entire request body by default, which might contain passwords or API keys submitted in a form, due to default Sentry-PHP settings or lack of explicit scrubbing.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive user data (credentials, personal information, etc.) to the Sentry platform.
        *   Potential misuse of this data if the Sentry account is compromised.
        *   Violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the data scrubbing options provided by Sentry-PHP to remove sensitive information.
        *   Use the `before_send` callback within Sentry-PHP to filter out sensitive data before it's sent to Sentry.
        *   Avoid capturing unnecessary context data through Sentry-PHP's configuration.
        *   Be mindful of the data included in stack traces and variable dumps captured by Sentry-PHP.
