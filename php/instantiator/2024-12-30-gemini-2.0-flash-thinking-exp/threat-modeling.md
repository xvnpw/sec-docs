### Doctrine Instantiator High and Critical Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats directly involving the `doctrine/instantiator` library:

* **Threat:** Bypassing Constructor Security Checks
    * **Description:** An attacker could leverage `instantiator` to create instances of classes without triggering the constructor's logic. This allows them to bypass security checks, input validation, or essential initialization routines that are normally enforced during object creation.
    * **Impact:** Creation of objects in an insecure or invalid state, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data corruption, or unexpected application behavior.
    * **Affected Component:** The core functionality of `Instantiator::instantiate()` and `Instantiator::instantiateWithoutConstructor()`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid relying solely on constructors for critical security checks or initialization when using `instantiator`.
        * Implement alternative validation and initialization mechanisms that are executed regardless of how the object is instantiated.
        * Carefully review the constructors of classes where `instantiator` is used to understand the security implications of bypassing them.

* **Threat:** Reliance on Constructor for Security Features Bypass
    * **Description:** An attacker could bypass security features that are exclusively set up within a class's constructor by using `instantiator`. This could leave the object in a vulnerable state, lacking necessary security configurations.
    * **Impact:**  Compromised security features, such as missing encryption keys, insecure connections, or disabled authorization mechanisms, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    * **Affected Component:** Objects created by `Instantiator::instantiate()` and `Instantiator::instantiateWithoutConstructor()`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid relying solely on constructors for setting up critical security features.
        * Implement alternative mechanisms for secure initialization that are independent of the instantiation method.
        * Consider using factory patterns or dependency injection to manage the creation and secure initialization of objects.

* **Threat:** Arbitrary Class Instantiation via Input Manipulation
    * **Description:** If the class name provided to `instantiator` is derived from untrusted input without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate this input to instantiate arbitrary classes. This could lead to the instantiation of sensitive internal classes or classes with unintended side effects.
    * **Impact:**  Instantiation of unintended classes, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service (if the instantiated class consumes excessive resources), or the execution of arbitrary code if the instantiated class has exploitable methods or side effects during autoloading or static initialization.
    * **Affected Component:** The `Instantiator::instantiate()` and `Instantiator::instantiateWithoutConstructor()` methods when the class name is dynamically determined.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strictly validate and sanitize any input used to determine the class name passed to `instantiator`**.
        * Implement a **whitelist of allowed classes** that can be instantiated.
        * Avoid using user-provided input directly to determine the class name.

* **Threat:** Gadget Chain Creation in Deserialization Scenarios
    * **Description:** In scenarios involving deserialization, an attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when processed and uses `instantiator` to create objects, bypasses constructors and sets specific property values. This can be used to construct "gadget chains" that lead to arbitrary code execution when other methods of these objects are subsequently called.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the application server.
    * **Affected Component:** The use of `Instantiator::instantiate()` and `Instantiator::instantiateWithoutConstructor()` within deserialization processes.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources whenever possible.**
        * If deserialization is necessary, use **safe deserialization methods** and carefully validate the structure and content of the serialized data.
        * **Analyze your codebase for potential gadget chains** and implement mitigations to break these chains.
        * Consider using alternative approaches to data transfer and persistence that do not involve deserialization of arbitrary objects.
