# Attack Surface Analysis for phacility/phabricator

## Attack Surface: [Access Control Bypass in Repositories (Diffusion)](./attack_surfaces/access_control_bypass_in_repositories__diffusion_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to code repositories or specific branches, allowing them to view, modify, or delete code they should not have access to.

**How Phabricator Contributes:** Phabricator manages repository access control through its permission system. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in this system can lead to bypasses. This includes issues with how permissions are inherited, applied to branches, or handled during repository creation.

**Example:** A user with read-only access to a repository is able to push changes to a specific branch due to a flaw in branch-level permission enforcement within Phabricator.

**Impact:** Code theft, introduction of malicious code, disruption of development workflows, data loss.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Access Control Configuration:** Carefully configure repository permissions within Phabricator, ensuring the principle of least privilege is applied. Regularly review and audit access controls within Phabricator's settings.
*   **Branch Protection Rules:** Utilize Phabricator's branch protection features to prevent unauthorized modifications to critical branches.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit the repository access control logic and configuration within Phabricator for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Issues](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_issues.md)

**Description:**  Weaknesses in the API authentication mechanisms or authorization checks allow unauthorized access to API endpoints and data manipulation.

**How Phabricator Contributes:** Phabricator provides a comprehensive API for interacting with its features. Vulnerabilities in how API keys, session tokens, or OAuth tokens are managed and validated *by Phabricator* can lead to unauthorized access. Insufficient authorization checks *within Phabricator's API endpoints* can allow users to perform actions they shouldn't.

**Example:** An attacker obtains a valid Phabricator API key and uses it to access or modify data belonging to other users due to insufficient authorization checks on a specific Phabricator API endpoint.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification within Phabricator, account compromise, denial of service against Phabricator services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure API Key Management:** Implement secure storage and rotation of Phabricator API keys. Avoid embedding keys directly in code.
*   **Robust Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for Phabricator API access (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Implement granular authorization checks on all Phabricator API endpoints.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on Phabricator API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Audit the Phabricator API authentication and authorization logic for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Phabricator Daemons](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_phabricator_daemons.md)

**Description:**  Security flaws in the background daemons responsible for tasks like email processing, repository indexing, or task queue management can be exploited.

**How Phabricator Contributes:** Phabricator relies on various daemons to perform background tasks. Vulnerabilities in *Phabricator's own daemons*, such as command injection or insecure processing of external data, can be exploited.

**Example:** A vulnerability in Phabricator's email processing daemon allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server by sending a specially crafted email that is processed by the daemon.

**Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches within Phabricator's data stores, denial of service, unauthorized access to Phabricator functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Phabricator Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Phabricator to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in the daemons.
*   **Secure Daemon Configuration:** Follow security best practices when configuring the Phabricator daemons, such as running them with minimal privileges.
*   **Input Validation:** Ensure Phabricator daemons properly validate any external data they process.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security audits specifically targeting the Phabricator daemons.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Code Review (Differential)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_code_review__differential_.md)

**Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into content displayed within the code review interface, which are then executed in the browsers of other users viewing the content.

**How Phabricator Contributes:** Phabricator renders user-provided content within code diffs, comments, and revision descriptions. If this content is not properly sanitized *by Phabricator*, it can be used to inject malicious scripts.

**Example:** A reviewer injects a `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` tag within a code comment in Phabricator's Differential, which executes when another user views the revision within Phabricator.

**Impact:** Account compromise (cookie theft, session hijacking within Phabricator), redirection to malicious sites, information disclosure within the Phabricator context.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side and client-side sanitization of all user-provided content within Phabricator's Differential.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure a strict CSP *for the Phabricator application* to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Phabricator application to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities.
