## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Phabricator ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_phabricator__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level signifies a complete breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Phabricator Core Functionality ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phabricator_core_functionality__critical_node_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks that target inherent weaknesses within Phabricator's code or design. Successful exploitation here can grant significant control over Phabricator and, consequently, the integrated application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Review (Differential) Weaknesses **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_review__differential__weaknesses__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within Phabricator's code review process (Differential).
        * **Inject Malicious Code During Review **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**:**
            * Attack Vector: An attacker, potentially a malicious insider or someone who has compromised a developer account, injects malicious code into a code review submission. If this code bypasses the review process and is merged, it can directly compromise the application. This often involves leveraging insufficient input sanitization or a lack of secure coding practices in the reviewed code.
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Diff Parsing/Rendering **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**:**
            * Attack Vector: An attacker crafts a specially designed diff (the changes being reviewed) that exploits vulnerabilities in how Phabricator parses or renders the diff content. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the attacker to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of users viewing the diff, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This path targets the mechanisms that control who can access Phabricator and what they are allowed to do. Weaknesses here are critical as they can grant unauthorized access.
        * **Exploit Phabricator Authentication Flaws **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**:**
            * Attack Vectors:
                * **Brute-force or Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by trying numerous combinations of usernames and passwords.
                * **Exploit known vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms:** This includes exploiting flaws in session management (e.g., predictable session IDs), password reset functionalities (e.g., insecure password reset tokens), or other authentication logic.
        * **Bypass Authorization Checks **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**:**
            * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit flaws in Phabricator's permission model or access control logic to gain access to resources or functionalities they are not authorized to use. This could involve manipulating requests, exploiting logic errors in permission checks, or leveraging default insecure configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Points Between Phabricator and the Application **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_points_between_phabricator_and_the_application__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application interacts with Phabricator. If the integration is not secure, it can be a significant point of weakness.
        * **Compromise Application Credentials Stored in Phabricator **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**:**
            * Attack Vector: If the application stores sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords) within Phabricator (perhaps in configuration settings, documentation, or custom fields), attackers can exploit vulnerabilities within Phabricator to access these credentials and then use them to directly compromise the application.
        * **Manipulate Data Exchanged Between Phabricator and Application **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**:**
            * Attack Vector: Attackers intercept or modify the data being exchanged between Phabricator and the application. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the API used for communication or through man-in-the-middle attacks. By manipulating this data, attackers can inject malicious commands or data into the application, leading to various forms of compromise.
        * **Exploit Trust Relationships **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**:**
            * Attack Vector: If the application implicitly trusts data or actions originating from Phabricator without proper verification, attackers can exploit this trust. For example, if the application automatically deploys code based on a Phabricator event without sufficient validation, a malicious actor could manipulate Phabricator to trigger a deployment of compromised code.
