# Threat Model Analysis for phacility/phabricator

## Threat: [Weak Default Credentials](./threats/weak_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in using default or easily guessable credentials that were not changed during the initial setup of Phabricator. This could be done through brute-force attacks or by exploiting publicly known default credentials.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Phabricator instance, allowing the attacker to access all data, modify configurations, and potentially pivot to other systems.

**Affected Component:** Authentication module, specifically the user management and login functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Force strong password changes during the initial setup process.
* Disable or remove default administrative accounts if possible.
* Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection in Differential Comments](./threats/malicious_code_injection_in_differential_comments.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into code review comments within Differential. When other users view the comment, the malicious script could execute in their browsers.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement of the Phabricator interface for other users.

**Affected Component:** Differential module, specifically the comment rendering functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content in Differential comments.
* Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Repository Access via Diffusion Permissions Bypass](./threats/unauthorized_repository_access_via_diffusion_permissions_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Diffusion's permission model to gain unauthorized access to repositories they should not have access to. This could involve manipulating URLs or exploiting flaws in permission checks.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive source code, intellectual property, and potentially credentials or secrets stored within the repositories. The attacker could also tamper with the code.

**Affected Component:** Diffusion module, specifically the repository access control and permission checking logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test Diffusion's permission configuration.
* Ensure that access control checks are consistently applied across all repository operations.
* Regularly audit repository permissions.

## Threat: [Abuse of Herald Rules for Privilege Escalation](./threats/abuse_of_herald_rules_for_privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges to create or modify Herald rules could create malicious rules that automatically grant them elevated privileges or perform actions they are not normally authorized to do.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain administrative access or perform sensitive actions within Phabricator.

**Affected Component:** Herald module, specifically the rule creation and execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict controls over who can create and modify Herald rules.
* Regularly review existing Herald rules for suspicious or overly permissive configurations.
* Implement auditing of Herald rule changes.

## Threat: [Insecure Custom Application Development](./threats/insecure_custom_application_development.md)

**Description:** Developers creating custom Phabricator applications might introduce security vulnerabilities through insecure coding practices, such as failing to sanitize input, improper authorization checks, or using vulnerable libraries.

**Impact:** A wide range of potential security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including data breaches, privilege escalation, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Custom Applications framework and the specific code of the vulnerable custom application.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce secure coding practices for custom application development.
* Conduct security reviews and penetration testing of custom extensions.
* Provide developers with security training and resources.
