# Threat Model Analysis for phacility/phabricator

## Threat: [Conduit API Authentication Bypass](./threats/conduit_api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in a specific Conduit API method (e.g., a parameter that isn't properly validated) within Phabricator's codebase and crafts a malicious request that bypasses authentication checks. This allows them to execute actions as if they were an authenticated user without providing valid credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Phabricator data and functionality. The attacker could potentially read sensitive information, modify data, or execute administrative actions depending on the bypassed method and the attacker's intent.
    *   **Affected Component:** Conduit API (specifically the vulnerable method within Phabricator).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update Phabricator to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all Conduit API methods within Phabricator's code. Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access within Phabricator's authorization logic. Conduct thorough security testing of Conduit API endpoints within Phabricator.

## Threat: [Weak Password Policy Leading to Credential Stuffing](./threats/weak_password_policy_leading_to_credential_stuffing.md)

*   **Description:** Phabricator's built-in authentication is configured with a weak password policy (e.g., short minimum length, no complexity requirements). Attackers can use lists of compromised credentials from other breaches (credential stuffing) to attempt to log in to Phabricator accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts within Phabricator, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of code reviews, tasks, or documentation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module within Phabricator.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements, password history) within Phabricator's configuration. Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts within Phabricator. Consider enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) within Phabricator's authentication settings.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Differential Comments](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_differential_comments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into a code review comment within Phabricator's Differential feature. When other users view the comment through Phabricator's interface, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf within the Phabricator context.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack affecting users viewing the malicious comment within Phabricator. Potential for session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions within the Phabricator environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Differential (comment rendering within Phabricator).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content in Differential comments within Phabricator's code. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) configured within Phabricator to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Diffusion Repository Permissions](./threats/information_disclosure_through_diffusion_repository_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** Repository permissions within Phabricator's Diffusion module are misconfigured, allowing unauthorized users to browse or clone repositories containing sensitive source code or internal documentation directly through Phabricator's interface.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of proprietary code, intellectual property, or confidential information to unauthorized individuals accessing Phabricator. This could lead to competitive disadvantage or security breaches in related systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Diffusion (repository access control within Phabricator).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement and regularly review repository access controls in Diffusion within Phabricator, ensuring that only authorized users have the necessary permissions. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning repository access within Phabricator.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Misconfigured Administrative Roles](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_misconfigured_administrative_roles.md)

*   **Description:** Administrative roles within Phabricator are misconfigured, granting excessive privileges to users who do not require them within Phabricator's role-based access control system. An attacker who compromises a lower-privileged account could then exploit these misconfigurations to escalate their privileges and gain administrative access to Phabricator.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Phabricator instance, allowing the attacker to control all aspects of the system, including data, users, and configurations within Phabricator.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication and Authorization modules (role-based access control within Phabricator).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning administrative roles within Phabricator. Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions within Phabricator. Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for administrative access within Phabricator.
