## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH START**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__or__high-risk_path_start.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The attacker identifies that the Phabricator instance has weak password policies (e.g., short minimum length, no complexity requirements, no password rotation enforcement).
    * Using readily available tools, the attacker attempts to guess common passwords or uses lists of leaked credentials to gain access to legitimate user accounts.
* Potential Impact: Successful login grants the attacker access to the user's privileges within Phabricator, potentially allowing them to view sensitive information, manipulate tasks, or even access code repositories depending on the compromised account's permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH START**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__or__high-risk_path_start.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The application uses custom integrations with Phabricator for authentication or authorization.
    * The attacker identifies vulnerabilities in how these integrations are implemented (e.g., improper validation of tokens, insecure API endpoints, flaws in the integration logic).
    * The attacker exploits these weaknesses to bypass Phabricator's intended authorization mechanisms, gaining access to resources or functionalities they shouldn't have.
* Potential Impact:  This could allow attackers to perform actions as other users, access restricted data, or even gain administrative privileges depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Management Vulnerabilities (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH START**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_management_vulnerabilities__or__high-risk_path_start.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The attacker targets developer accounts with write access to code repositories managed by Phabricator.
    * This can be achieved through various means, including phishing, social engineering, exploiting vulnerabilities on the developer's machine, or even through brute-force if the developer uses a weak password.
    * Once the developer account is compromised, the attacker can directly inject malicious code into the repository, which could then be deployed with the application.
* Potential Impact: This is a critical vulnerability allowing attackers to introduce backdoors, steal sensitive data, or completely compromise the application's functionality and security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Account with Repository Write Access (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Critical, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Medium) **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_account_with_repository_write_access__likelihood_medium__impact_critical__effor_5e87adc3.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The attacker targets developer accounts with write access to code repositories managed by Phabricator.
    * This can be achieved through various means, including phishing, social engineering, exploiting vulnerabilities on the developer's machine, or even through brute-force if the developer uses a weak password.
    * Once the developer account is compromised, the attacker can directly inject malicious code into the repository, which could then be deployed with the application.
* Potential Impact: This is a critical vulnerability allowing attackers to introduce backdoors, steal sensitive data, or completely compromise the application's functionality and security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Phabricator's Repository Management (Likelihood: Low, Impact: Critical, Effort: High, Skill Level: Advanced, Detection Difficulty: High) **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phabricator's_repository_management__likelihood_low__impact_critical__eff_9f087564.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities directly within Phabricator's repository management features (e.g., flaws in how push requests are handled, vulnerabilities in merge request processing, or access control bypasses at the repository level).
    * This could allow them to push malicious code, alter existing code, or gain unauthorized access to the repository without compromising individual accounts.
* Potential Impact: Similar to compromising a developer account, this can lead to the injection of malicious code, data breaches, and complete application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Management Vulnerabilities (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH START**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_management_vulnerabilities__or__high-risk_path_start.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The attacker, potentially a compromised insider or someone who has gained initial access, submits seemingly benign code changes for review.
    * The malicious code is subtly hidden or obfuscated in a way that it is not easily detected during the code review process.
    * Once approved and merged, this malicious code becomes part of the application.
* Potential Impact: This can introduce vulnerabilities that bypass initial security checks, leading to various forms of compromise depending on the nature of the injected code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Administration Weaknesses (OR) **HIGH-RISK PATH START**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_administration_weaknesses__or__high-risk_path_start.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The attacker targets the administrator account for the Phabricator instance.
    * This is often achieved by exploiting weak passwords or the lack of multi-factor authentication on the admin account.
    * Other methods could include exploiting vulnerabilities in the Phabricator login process itself.
* Potential Impact: Gaining administrative access grants the attacker complete control over the Phabricator instance. This allows them to modify configurations, access all data, create new malicious accounts, and potentially gain access to the underlying application server or connected systems. This is a critical compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Phabricator Administrator Account (AND)
       └── Exploit Weak Password or Lack of MFA on Admin Account (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Critical, Effort: Low, Skill Level: Beginner, Detection Difficulty: Low) **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_phabricator_administrator_account__and________└──_exploit_weak_password_or_lack_of_mfa_on_ee52ad99.md)

* Attack Vector:
    * The attacker targets the administrator account for the Phabricator instance.
    * This is often achieved by exploiting weak passwords or the lack of multi-factor authentication on the admin account.
