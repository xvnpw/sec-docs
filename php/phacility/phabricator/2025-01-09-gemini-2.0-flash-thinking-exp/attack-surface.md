# Attack Surface Analysis for phacility/phabricator

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Differential Comments](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_differential_comments.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into code review comments, which is then executed in the browsers of other users viewing the same comment.
*   **How Phabricator Contributes:** Phabricator's Differential feature allows users to add rich text comments. If the rendering of these comments doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input, it becomes vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` tag into a code review comment. When another developer views this comment, the alert box pops up, demonstrating the execution of arbitrary JavaScript. This could be used for session hijacking, data theft, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side output encoding and sanitization of user-provided content before rendering it in Differential comments. Utilize context-aware escaping techniques. Regularly update Phabricator to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about clicking on links or interacting with unexpected elements within code review comments.

## Attack Surface: [API Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in Phabricator's API authorization logic allow users to access or modify resources they are not permitted to.
*   **How Phabricator Contributes:** Phabricator's API provides programmatic access to its features. If the authorization checks within the API endpoints are flawed, attackers can bypass intended access controls.
*   **Example:** A user with read-only access to a project is able to use an API endpoint to modify a task within that project due to a flaw in the API's authorization logic.
*   **Impact:** Data modification, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential disruption of workflows.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement thorough unit and integration tests specifically for API authorization logic. Follow the principle of least privilege when designing API endpoints and permissions. Regularly review and audit API authorization code. Use Phabricator's built-in permission checking functions correctly.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Phriction Wiki Pages](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_phriction_wiki_pages.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into Phriction wiki pages, which is then executed in the browsers of other users viewing the same page.
*   **How Phabricator Contributes:** Phabricator's Phriction application uses a markup language for creating wiki pages. If the parsing and rendering of this markup doesn't properly sanitize user input, it can lead to stored XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious `<script>` tag into a wiki page. When other users view this page, the script executes, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to a phishing site.
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side output encoding and sanitization of user-provided content before rendering Phriction wiki pages. Use a secure markup parser and ensure it's up-to-date. Employ context-aware escaping.
    *   **Users:** Be cautious about clicking on unexpected links or interacting with elements on Phriction wiki pages, especially from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how Phabricator manages user sessions can allow attackers to hijack active sessions.
*   **How Phabricator Contributes:** Phabricator uses session cookies to maintain user authentication. If these cookies are not securely generated, stored, or invalidated, it creates a vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  Predictable session IDs could allow an attacker to guess valid session IDs and impersonate users. Lack of secure flags on cookies (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`) could make them vulnerable to interception. Failure to invalidate sessions after logout could allow reuse of credentials.
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators for session ID generation. Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies. Implement proper session invalidation upon logout and after a period of inactivity. Consider implementing mechanisms to detect and prevent session fixation attacks.
    *   **Users:** Avoid using Phabricator on untrusted networks. Log out of Phabricator when finished using it, especially on shared computers.
