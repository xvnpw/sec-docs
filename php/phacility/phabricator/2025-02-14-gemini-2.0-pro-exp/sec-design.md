## DEPLOYMENT

Phabricator is typically self-hosted, meaning organizations deploy it on their own infrastructure.  Several deployment options are possible:

1.  **Bare Metal/Virtual Machine:**  Deploying directly onto a physical or virtual server.
2.  **Containers (Docker):**  Packaging Phabricator and its dependencies into Docker containers.
3.  **Cloud-Based VMs:**  Deploying on virtual machines provided by cloud providers (AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs).
4.  **Kubernetes:** Orchestrating Phabricator deployments using Kubernetes.

We'll describe a deployment using **Docker Compose** on a single virtual machine, as it's a common and relatively straightforward approach.

## BUILD

Phabricator's build process, based on the repository, appears to involve a combination of manual steps and some automation. There isn't a clearly defined CI/CD pipeline in the traditional sense (like Jenkins or GitHub Actions). The `scripts/` directory contains various shell scripts for tasks like building documentation and running tests.

Here's a simplified representation of the build process:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[Developer] --> CodeRepository[Code Repository (Git)]
    CodeRepository --> BuildServer[Build Server]
    BuildServer --> PhabricatorArtifacts[Phabricator Artifacts]
    BuildServer -.-> Linters[Linters]
    BuildServer -.-> TestSuite[Test Suite]

    classDef borderless stroke-width:0px
    class Linters,TestSuite borderless
```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Developer:** Developers write code and commit changes to the Git repository.
2.  **Code Repository:** The Git repository (hosted on GitHub in this case) stores the source code.
3.  **Build Server:** A server (potentially a developer's machine or a dedicated build machine) is used to execute build scripts.
4.  **Linters:** Code linters (like `arc lint`) are used to check for code style and potential errors.
5.  **Test Suite:** Unit tests and other tests are executed to verify code functionality.
6.  **Phabricator Artifacts:** The build process results in a deployable version of Phabricator (essentially the codebase itself, as it's a PHP application).

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   Code Review:  Phabricator's own code review process is a crucial security control.
*   Linters:  Help enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.
*   Unit Tests:  Help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   Manual Steps: Many build and deployment steps are likely manual, which introduces a risk of human error.

Recommendations:

*   Implement a more robust CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
*   Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the build process.
*   Automate dependency vulnerability scanning using SCA tools.
*   Implement code signing to ensure the integrity of the released artifacts.
