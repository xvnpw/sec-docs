Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Malicious Herald Rule Abuse" threat for a Phabricator installation.

## Deep Analysis: Malicious Herald Rule Abuse in Phabricator

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Malicious Herald Rule Abuse" threat, identify specific attack vectors, assess the potential impact, and propose concrete, actionable recommendations beyond the initial mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide developers with a clear understanding of *how* this threat manifests and *what* specific code changes and configurations are needed to mitigate it effectively.  We also aim to provide administrators with best practices for managing Herald rules.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the threat of malicious Herald rule abuse within Phabricator.  It encompasses:

*   **Herald Rule Creation and Execution:**  The entire lifecycle of a Herald rule, from creation to triggering and action execution.
*   **Herald Actions:**  All available Herald actions, with a particular focus on those with the highest potential for abuse (e.g., webhooks, object manipulation).
*   **Herald Conditions:**  All available Herald conditions, examining how they can be combined to create overly broad or targeted triggers.
*   **Underlying Code:**  Relevant sections of the Phabricator codebase related to Herald, including rule parsing, validation, action execution, and permission checks.
*   **Configuration Options:**  Phabricator configuration settings that can influence Herald's behavior and security.
*   **Audit Logs:** How Herald actions are logged and how those logs can be used for detection and investigation.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other Phabricator vulnerabilities unrelated to Herald.
*   External attacks that do not involve Herald rule manipulation.
*   Physical security or network-level attacks.

**1.3 Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examination of the Phabricator source code (specifically the `Herald` application and related models/controllers) to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Using the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to systematically analyze potential attack vectors.
*   **Abuse Case Analysis:**  Developing specific, realistic scenarios of how an attacker might exploit Herald rules.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Comparing Phabricator's Herald implementation against industry best practices for rule engines and automation systems.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Analyzing Phabricator's official documentation for Herald to identify any gaps or inconsistencies.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Threat Actors:**

*   **Malicious Insider:** A user with legitimate access to Phabricator but with malicious intent.  This user may have permission to create Herald rules or may exploit a separate vulnerability to gain such permission.
*   **Compromised Account:** An attacker who has gained control of a legitimate user's account, potentially through phishing, password theft, or session hijacking.
*   **External Attacker (with internal access):**  An attacker who has gained some level of access to the Phabricator instance, perhaps through a separate vulnerability, and is now attempting to leverage Herald for further exploitation.

**2.2 Attack Vectors and Abuse Cases:**

Here are several specific attack vectors, categorized by the type of malicious action:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**

    *   **Webhook to External Server:**  An attacker creates a rule that triggers on every new commit or task creation.  The action is a webhook that sends the commit message, task description, or other sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.  This could include API keys, passwords, or confidential project information accidentally committed.
        *   **Condition:** `Object type is Diffusion Commit` or `Object type is Maniphest Task`.
        *   **Action:** `Send a webhook to...` (attacker's URL).
        *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how webhook URLs are validated and whether any restrictions can be bypassed.  Check for potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Email Exfiltration:** Similar to the webhook, but using the "Send an email" action.  While email might be monitored, an attacker could use a temporary or anonymous email address.
        *   **Condition:** `Content contains "password"` or `Content contains "API key"`.
        *   **Action:** `Send an email to...` (attacker's email).
        *   **Code Review Focus:**  Ensure email addresses are validated and that there are limits on the size and frequency of emails sent by Herald.

*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**

    *   **Automatic Task Closure:** An attacker creates a rule to automatically close all newly created tasks, disrupting project workflow.
        *   **Condition:** `Object type is Maniphest Task` and `Transaction type is Create`.
        *   **Action:** `Close task`.
        *   **Code Review Focus:**  Verify that permission checks are correctly enforced when Herald actions modify objects.  Ensure that users cannot create rules that affect objects they wouldn't normally have permission to modify.
    *   **Object Deletion (if enabled):** If Phabricator is configured to allow Herald to delete objects, an attacker could create a rule to delete commits, tasks, or other critical data.
        *   **Condition:** `Object type is Diffusion Commit` and `Author is [specific user]`.
        *   **Action:** `Delete object` (This action might be restricted by default, but configuration review is crucial).
        *   **Code Review Focus:**  Scrutinize the code that handles object deletion via Herald.  Ensure that this action is heavily restricted and logged.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**

    *   **Webhook Flood:**  An attacker creates a rule that triggers a webhook to a legitimate service (e.g., a monitoring system) on every commit.  This could overwhelm the target service, causing a DoS.
        *   **Condition:** `Object type is Diffusion Commit`.
        *   **Action:** `Send a webhook to...` (target service's URL).
        *   **Code Review Focus:**  Implement rate limiting for webhook actions, both per rule and globally.  Consider using a queueing system to prevent synchronous webhook calls from blocking Phabricator's main processes.
    *   **Infinite Loop:** An attacker crafts a rule that triggers itself, creating an infinite loop.  For example, a rule that adds a comment to a task, and another rule that triggers on any comment added to a task, could lead to a loop.
        *   **Condition:** `Object type is Maniphest Task` and `Transaction type is Comment`.
        *   **Action:** `Add comment...`.
        *   **Code Review Focus:**  Implement loop detection mechanisms within Herald.  This could involve tracking the execution history of a rule and preventing it from triggering itself recursively.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Creating a large number of rules, even if they don't trigger often, can consume server resources.
        * **Code Review Focus:** Implement limits on the number of rules per user and globally.

*   **Spamming:**

    *   **Notification Spam:** An attacker creates a rule to send notifications to all users on every commit or task update, flooding their inboxes.
        *   **Condition:** `Object type is Diffusion Commit`.
        *   **Action:** `Send notification to...` (all users or a large user group).
        *   **Code Review Focus:**  Implement rate limiting for notifications.  Consider allowing users to disable Herald-generated notifications.

**2.3 STRIDE Analysis:**

| STRIDE Category | Threat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spoofing**    | An attacker could potentially spoof the author of a commit or task to trigger a rule that is designed to only apply to specific users.  This would require exploiting a separate vulnerability to manipulate object metadata.                                                                    |
| **Tampering**   | An attacker directly modifies the Herald rule data in the database (if they gain database access).  This bypasses any UI-level validation.  They could also tamper with the conditions or actions of an existing rule to make it malicious.                                                        |
| **Repudiation** | If Herald actions are not properly logged, an attacker could deny creating or modifying a malicious rule.  Lack of detailed audit trails makes it difficult to trace the source of the attack.                                                                                                   |
| **Information Disclosure** | As described in the Data Exfiltration attack vectors, Herald rules can be used to leak sensitive information via webhooks or emails.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Denial of Service** | As described in the DoS attack vectors, Herald rules can be used to overwhelm external services or consume server resources, leading to a denial of service.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | An attacker might exploit a vulnerability in Herald to perform actions that they would not normally be authorized to perform.  For example, a user without permission to delete tasks might be able to create a Herald rule that deletes tasks.                                               |

**2.4 Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Actual Code Access):**

This section would contain specific findings from a code review.  Since we don't have access to the Phabricator codebase, we'll provide hypothetical examples:

*   **Hypothetical Finding 1:**  The `HeraldWebhookAction` class does not validate the webhook URL against a whitelist or blacklist.  This could allow an attacker to send data to any arbitrary URL, including internal network resources (SSRF).
*   **Hypothetical Finding 2:**  The `HeraldRuleController` does not properly check user permissions before allowing a rule to be created or modified.  A user might be able to create a rule that affects objects they don't have access to.
*   **Hypothetical Finding 3:**  The `HeraldEngine` does not have a mechanism to detect and prevent infinite loops caused by rules triggering each other.
*   **Hypothetical Finding 4:**  Audit logs for Herald actions only record the rule ID and the action taken, but not the specific data that was sent (e.g., the webhook payload).  This makes it difficult to investigate data exfiltration attempts.
*   **Hypothetical Finding 5:**  Rate limiting for Herald actions is only implemented globally, not per rule or per user.  This could allow a single malicious rule to consume all available resources.

### 3. Enhanced Mitigation Strategies

Based on the deep analysis, here are enhanced mitigation strategies, categorized for developers and administrators:

**3.1 Developer Mitigations (Code Changes):**

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strict Webhook URL Validation:** Implement a whitelist of allowed webhook URLs.  If a whitelist is not feasible, use a blacklist to block known malicious domains and internal network addresses.  Prevent SSRF by disallowing requests to loopback addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1) and private IP ranges.
    *   **Email Address Validation:**  Enforce strict validation of email addresses used in the "Send an email" action.  Consider requiring email addresses to belong to a specific domain or be pre-approved.
    *   **Condition and Action Parameter Validation:**  Validate all parameters passed to Herald conditions and actions.  For example, ensure that object IDs are valid and that text fields do not contain malicious code (e.g., JavaScript injection).
*   **Limit Action Scope:**
    *   **Permission Checks:**  Before executing any Herald action that modifies or deletes an object, perform a permission check to ensure that the user who *created* the rule (or the Phabricator system user, if applicable) has the necessary permissions to perform that action on that specific object.  This prevents privilege escalation.
    *   **Object Type Restrictions:**  Restrict the types of objects that can be affected by certain actions.  For example, prevent the "Delete object" action from being used on critical object types like repositories or users.
    *   **Action-Specific Restrictions:**  Implement restrictions specific to each action.  For example, limit the "Add comment" action to a maximum comment length.
*   **Rate Limiting and Resource Quotas:**
    *   **Per-Rule Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting for each individual Herald rule.  This prevents a single malicious rule from overwhelming the system.
    *   **Per-User Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting for all Herald actions performed by a specific user.
    *   **Global Rate Limiting:**  Maintain global rate limits for all Herald actions.
    *   **Resource Quotas:**  Limit the number of Herald rules that a user can create.  Limit the number of actions that a single rule can perform.
*   **Quarantine Suspicious Rules:**
    *   **Heuristic Analysis:**  Implement heuristic analysis to identify potentially malicious rules.  For example, flag rules that use webhooks to external domains or that trigger on a large number of events.
    *   **Manual Review:**  Provide a mechanism for administrators to manually review and approve new Herald rules before they are activated.
    *   **Automatic Disabling:**  Automatically disable rules that are flagged as suspicious or that exceed rate limits.
*   **Loop Detection:**
    *   **Execution History Tracking:**  Track the execution history of each Herald rule.  Detect and prevent loops by checking if a rule is attempting to trigger itself recursively.
*   **Enhanced Auditing:**
    *   **Detailed Action Logs:**  Log detailed information about each Herald action, including the rule ID, the user who created the rule, the action taken, the object affected, and any relevant data (e.g., the webhook payload, the email body).  Ensure that sensitive data is appropriately masked or redacted in the logs.
    *   **Tamper-Proof Logs:**  Implement measures to prevent attackers from tampering with or deleting Herald audit logs.
* **Sandboxing:**
    * Consider sandboxing the execution of Herald actions, especially webhooks. This could involve running the action in a separate process or container with limited privileges.

**3.2 User/Admin Mitigations (Configuration and Best Practices):**

*   **Restrict Herald Access:**
    *   **Permission Management:**  Carefully manage Herald permissions.  Only grant the ability to create and modify Herald rules to trusted users.  Consider creating a separate "Herald Administrator" role with specific permissions.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Actions:**  Disable any Herald actions that are not needed.  For example, if webhooks are not required, disable the "Send a webhook" action.
*   **Audit Rules Regularly:**
    *   **Periodic Reviews:**  Conduct regular audits of all active Herald rules.  Look for suspicious patterns, overly broad conditions, and potentially malicious actions.
    *   **Automated Scanning:**  Use scripts or tools to automatically scan Herald rules for known vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.
*   **Review Process for New Rules:**
    *   **Approval Workflow:**  Implement an approval workflow for new Herald rules.  Require that all new rules be reviewed and approved by an administrator before they are activated.
*   **Monitor Audit Logs:**
    *   **Real-time Monitoring:**  Monitor Herald audit logs in real-time for suspicious activity.  Use a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system to aggregate and analyze logs from multiple sources.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to notify administrators of suspicious Herald activity, such as failed webhook calls, excessive rule executions, or rule modifications.
*   **User Education:**
    *   **Training:**  Train users on the proper use of Herald and the potential risks of malicious rule abuse.  Educate them on how to create secure and effective rules.
* **Configuration Review:**
    * Regularly review Phabricator's configuration settings related to Herald. Ensure that security-related settings are configured appropriately.

### 4. Conclusion
