# Deep Analysis of Phabricator Attack Tree Path: 3.1 - Exploit Weaknesses in Server Configuration

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path "3.1 Exploit Weaknesses in Server Configuration" within the context of a Phabricator deployment.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities related to default credentials, assessing the potential impact of successful exploitation, and providing concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation beyond the high-level suggestions already present in the attack tree.  We aim to provide the development team with a clear understanding of the risks and practical steps to enhance the security posture of the Phabricator server.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on attack path 3.1 and its sub-node 3.1.1:

*   **3.1 Exploit Weaknesses in Server Configuration:**  We will analyze common server misconfigurations that could be exploited.  While the general mitigation is provided, we will delve deeper into specific examples relevant to Phabricator.
*   **3.1.1 Default Credentials for Database/Services:** We will examine the specific risks associated with default credentials for the database (typically MySQL) and other services that Phabricator might rely on (e.g., caching services like Memcached, search services like Elasticsearch).  We will *not* cover application-level default credentials within Phabricator itself (that would be a separate attack path).

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors within the broader attack tree, such as client-side attacks, social engineering, or vulnerabilities within the Phabricator application code itself.  It also excludes physical security of the server.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify specific, real-world examples of server misconfigurations and default credential vulnerabilities that could affect a Phabricator installation.  This will involve researching common Phabricator deployment setups and known vulnerabilities in related software.
2.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of a successful exploit.  This includes considering the level of access gained, the data that could be compromised, and the potential for further attacks.
3.  **Mitigation Recommendation Refinement:**  Provide detailed, actionable mitigation steps beyond the general recommendations.  This will include specific configuration changes, commands, and best practices.
4.  **Verification Strategies:** Suggest methods for verifying that the mitigations have been implemented correctly and are effective.
5.  **Documentation Review:** Examine Phabricator's official documentation for any gaps or areas where security guidance could be improved regarding server configuration.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.1

### 2.1 Vulnerability Identification (3.1 & 3.1.1)

Here are specific examples of server misconfigurations and default credential vulnerabilities, categorized for clarity:

**A. Database (MySQL/MariaDB):**

*   **Default `root` Account with No Password (or Weak Password):**  A fresh MySQL/MariaDB installation often has a `root` user with a blank password or a well-known default password.  An attacker gaining access to this account has complete control over the Phabricator database, including all user data, code repositories, task details, etc.
*   **Anonymous User Accounts:**  MySQL can have anonymous user accounts that allow connections without any credentials.  These accounts might have limited privileges, but could still be used for reconnaissance or to exploit other vulnerabilities.
*   **`test` Database:**  Default MySQL installations often include a `test` database accessible to all users.  While seemingly harmless, it can be used for testing exploits or storing malicious data.
*   **Insecure File Permissions on MySQL Data Directory:**  If the directory containing the MySQL data files (e.g., `/var/lib/mysql`) has overly permissive permissions, an attacker with local access to the server (perhaps through another vulnerability) could directly read or modify the database files.
*   **MySQL Listening on Public Interface:** If the MySQL server is configured to listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of just `localhost` (127.0.0.1), it becomes accessible from the internet if not properly firewalled.

**B. Other Services (Memcached, Elasticsearch, etc.):**

*   **Memcached with No Authentication:**  Phabricator can use Memcached for caching.  If Memcached is running without authentication, any process on the server (or potentially from the network, if exposed) can read and write to the cache.  While this might not directly expose sensitive data, it could be used to disrupt Phabricator's operation or potentially inject malicious data.
*   **Elasticsearch with No Authentication/Authorization:**  If Phabricator uses Elasticsearch for search functionality, and Elasticsearch is running without proper authentication and authorization, an attacker could access and modify search indexes, potentially exposing sensitive information or disrupting search functionality.  Default installations often lack security.
*   **Redis with No Authentication:** Similar to Memcached, if Redis is used and lacks authentication, it presents a risk.

**C. General Server Misconfigurations:**

*   **Unnecessary Services Running:**  Any service running on the server that is not strictly required by Phabricator increases the attack surface.  Examples include old web servers, FTP servers, or development tools left running in production.
*   **Outdated Operating System and Software:**  Running an outdated operating system or software packages (e.g., PHP, Apache/Nginx, OpenSSL) exposes the server to known vulnerabilities that have publicly available exploits.
*   **Weak SSH Configuration:**  Weak SSH configurations (e.g., allowing password authentication, using weak ciphers) can allow attackers to gain shell access to the server.
*   **Insecure File Permissions (General):**  Files and directories related to Phabricator (e.g., the webroot, configuration files) should have the minimum necessary permissions.  Overly permissive permissions could allow attackers to modify files or gain access to sensitive information.
*   **Default Web Server Configurations:** Default configurations for web servers (Apache, Nginx) often contain information disclosure vulnerabilities (e.g., server version banners) or allow access to unnecessary directories.

### 2.2 Impact Assessment

The impact of successfully exploiting these vulnerabilities ranges from moderate to critical:

*   **Database Compromise (MySQL/MariaDB):**  This is the most critical scenario.  An attacker with full access to the database can:
    *   Steal all data stored in Phabricator, including user credentials, source code, project details, and internal communications.
    *   Modify data, potentially introducing malicious code, altering user permissions, or deleting critical information.
    *   Use the compromised database as a launching point for further attacks on other systems.
*   **Service Compromise (Memcached, Elasticsearch, Redis):**  The impact here depends on the specific service.  Compromising Memcached might lead to denial-of-service or data corruption.  Compromising Elasticsearch could expose sensitive data indexed for search.
*   **General Server Compromise:**  Gaining shell access to the server through SSH or exploiting other misconfigurations allows the attacker to:
    *   Install malware.
    *   Exfiltrate data.
    *   Use the server for malicious purposes (e.g., launching attacks on other systems).
    *   Completely disrupt Phabricator's operation.

### 2.3 Mitigation Recommendation Refinement

Here are specific, actionable mitigation steps:

**A. Database (MySQL/MariaDB):**

1.  **Secure the `root` Account:**
    *   **Immediately after installation**, run `mysql_secure_installation`. This script will guide you through:
        *   Setting a strong password for the `root` account.
        *   Removing anonymous user accounts.
        *   Disabling remote `root` login.
        *   Removing the `test` database.
    *   Alternatively, manually execute these SQL commands (after connecting as `root`):
        ```sql
        ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_very_strong_password';
        DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';
        DELETE FROM mysql.db WHERE Db='test' OR Db='test_%';
        DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS test;
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        ```
2.  **Restrict Network Access:**
    *   Configure MySQL to listen only on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by setting `bind-address = 127.0.0.1` in the MySQL configuration file (usually `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` or `/etc/my.cnf`).
    *   Use a firewall (e.g., `ufw`, `iptables`) to block all external access to port 3306 (the default MySQL port).
3.  **Secure File Permissions:**
    *   Ensure the MySQL data directory (e.g., `/var/lib/mysql`) is owned by the `mysql` user and group, and has permissions set to `700` (read, write, and execute only for the owner).
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
    sudo chmod -R 700 /var/lib/mysql
    ```

**B. Other Services (Memcached, Elasticsearch, Redis):**

1.  **Enable Authentication:**
    *   **Memcached:**  Start Memcached with the `-U 0` (disable UDP) and `-m <memory_limit>` options, and configure authentication if supported by your version.  Consult the Memcached documentation for details.
    *   **Elasticsearch:**  Use X-Pack security features (now part of the basic license) to enable authentication and authorization.  This involves setting up users and roles, and configuring TLS/SSL for secure communication.
    *   **Redis:**  Use the `requirepass` directive in the Redis configuration file (`redis.conf`) to set a strong password.
2.  **Restrict Network Access:**
    *   Configure these services to listen only on `localhost` if they don't need to be accessed from other machines.
    *   Use a firewall to block external access to the ports used by these services.

**C. General Server Misconfigurations:**

1.  **Disable Unnecessary Services:**
    *   Identify and disable any services that are not required by Phabricator.  Use `systemctl` (on systemd-based systems) or `service` to manage services.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
    sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
    ```
2.  **Keep Software Up-to-Date:**
    *   Regularly update the operating system and all installed software packages.  Use the system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`) to apply updates.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade  # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo yum update                     # CentOS/RHEL
    ```
3.  **Secure SSH:**
    *   Disable password authentication and use SSH keys instead.  Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and set `PasswordAuthentication no`.
    *   Consider using a non-standard SSH port (e.g., 2222) to reduce the number of automated attacks.
    *   Use strong ciphers and MACs.
4.  **Secure File Permissions:**
    *   Review the file permissions for all files and directories related to Phabricator.  Ensure that only the necessary users and groups have access.  Use `chown`, `chgrp`, and `chmod` to adjust permissions.
5.  **Harden Web Server Configuration:**
    *   Disable server version banners in Apache/Nginx configuration.
    *   Restrict access to unnecessary directories.
    *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
    *   Enable HTTPS and configure strong TLS/SSL settings.

### 2.4 Verification Strategies

After implementing the mitigations, it's crucial to verify their effectiveness:

1.  **Database:**
    *   Try to connect to the MySQL server from a remote machine without credentials.  This should fail.
    *   Try to connect to the MySQL server from the local machine using the `root` account without a password.  This should fail.
    *   Try to connect using an anonymous user. This should fail.
    *   Check the MySQL error logs for any suspicious activity.
2.  **Other Services:**
    *   Try to connect to Memcached, Elasticsearch, or Redis from a remote machine without credentials.  This should fail.
    *   Try to connect to these services from the local machine without credentials (if authentication is enabled).  This should fail.
3.  **General Server:**
    *   Use a vulnerability scanner (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) to scan the server for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use a port scanner (e.g., Nmap) to check which ports are open and listening.
    *   Review the server logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog`, web server logs) for any suspicious activity.
    *   Use `ss -tulnp` to list listening network sockets and ensure only expected services are listening.

### 2.5 Documentation Review

Phabricator's official documentation should be reviewed to ensure it provides clear and comprehensive guidance on securing the server environment.  Specific areas to check include:

*   **Installation Guide:**  Does it explicitly mention the need to change default credentials and secure the database?
*   **Configuration Guide:**  Does it provide detailed instructions on configuring security settings for various services (MySQL, Memcached, Elasticsearch, etc.)?
*   **Security Best Practices:**  Does it have a dedicated section on security best practices, covering topics like server hardening, firewall configuration, and regular updates?

If any gaps are found, recommendations should be made to the Phabricator development team to improve the documentation.  This could involve submitting pull requests or opening issues on their issue tracker.
