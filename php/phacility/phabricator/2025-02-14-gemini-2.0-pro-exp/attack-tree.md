## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   **1.1 Identify Unpatched Instance [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker determines if the Phabricator instance is running a vulnerable version. This is a prerequisite for exploiting known CVEs.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Passive reconnaissance (examining HTTP headers, inspecting source code, reviewing changelogs, using search engines).
        *   Active reconnaissance (probing for vulnerable endpoints, fuzzing API endpoints).
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep Phabricator and all dependencies up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] 1.2 Exploit Specific CVE [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__1_2_exploit_specific_cve__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker leverages a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) to compromise the system.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **1.2.1 CVE-XXXX-YYYY (RCE via Malicious File Upload):**
            *   **Description:** A vulnerability allows attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code by bypassing file upload restrictions.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Craft a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script disguised as an image).
                2.  Bypass file type and content validation mechanisms.
                3.  Trigger the vulnerability by accessing the uploaded file, leading to code execution.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict file type and content validation, store uploaded files outside the web root, and use a separate domain for file storage.
        *   **1.2.2 CVE-AAAA-BBBB (SQL Injection in Search):**
            *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the search functionality allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Identify a vulnerable search parameter.
                2.  Craft a SQL injection payload to extract data or modify the database.
                3.  Execute the payload through the search function.
            *   **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. Implement input validation and output encoding.
        *   **1.2.3 CVE-CCCC-DDDD (XSS in a specific module):**
            *   **Description:** A vulnerability in a specific module allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Craft an XSS payload (JavaScript code).
                2.  Inject the payload into a vulnerable field (e.g., a comment field, a profile field).
                3.  When another user views the injected content, the JavaScript executes, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting the user.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding (context-aware escaping). Use a Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Phabricator Features](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_phabricator_features.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] 2.1 Manipulate User Accounts [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__2_1_manipulate_user_accounts__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially including administrative accounts.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] 2.1.1 Weak Password Guessing/Brute-Forcing:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to guess user passwords by trying common passwords or systematically trying all possible combinations.
            *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity), implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts, and use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   **2.1.3 Social Engineering to Obtain Credentials:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker tricks users into revealing their credentials through phishing emails, phone calls, or other deceptive techniques.
            *   **Mitigation:** User education and awareness training on recognizing and avoiding phishing and social engineering attacks.
        *   **Mitigation (General for 2.1):** Strong password policies, MFA, rate limiting, secure password reset mechanisms, and user education.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise Underlying Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_underlying_infrastructure.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Exploit Weaknesses in Server Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_exploit_weaknesses_in_server_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits misconfigurations in the server environment to gain access.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **3.1.1 Default Credentials for Database/Services:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses default, unchanged credentials for the database (e.g., MySQL) or other services to gain access.
            *   **Mitigation:** Change all default credentials immediately after installation. Use strong, unique passwords for all services.
        *   **Mitigation (General for 3.1):** Harden server configuration, change default credentials, ensure proper file permissions, restrict network access to services, and keep the operating system and all software up-to-date.
