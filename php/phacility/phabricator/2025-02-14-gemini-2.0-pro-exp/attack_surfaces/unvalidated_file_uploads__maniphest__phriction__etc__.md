Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Unvalidated File Uploads" attack surface in Phabricator.

## Deep Analysis: Unvalidated File Uploads in Phabricator

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with unvalidated file uploads in Phabricator, identify specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies for both developers and administrators.  We aim to move beyond a general understanding and delve into the specifics of *how* Phabricator's code and configuration might be vulnerable.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface of file uploads within Phabricator, encompassing all modules that allow file uploads, including but not limited to:

*   **Maniphest:**  Task management (attachments to tasks).
*   **Phriction:**  Wiki documentation (image uploads, attachments).
*   **Files:**  General file storage and sharing.
*   **Differential:** Code review (potentially through patch files or attachments, though less direct).
*   **Paste:**  Code snippets (less likely to be a direct file upload, but could involve similar processing).
*   Any custom applications or extensions built on top of Phabricator that introduce file upload functionality.

We will *not* cover vulnerabilities in *external* services that Phabricator might integrate with (e.g., a vulnerability in a configured virus scanner).  We are focused on Phabricator's *internal* handling of uploaded files.

**1.3 Methodology:**

Our analysis will follow a multi-pronged approach:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the relevant sections of the Phabricator codebase (available on GitHub) to identify potential weaknesses in file handling logic.  This includes:
    *   File type validation mechanisms.
    *   File storage procedures (location, permissions).
    *   Filename sanitization routines.
    *   Error handling related to file uploads.
    *   Input validation before file processing.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical Testing):**  We will construct hypothetical attack scenarios based on common file upload vulnerabilities and describe how they might manifest in Phabricator.  This is *not* live penetration testing, but rather a thought experiment based on code review and known attack patterns.
3.  **Configuration Review:**  We will analyze Phabricator's configuration options related to file uploads and identify settings that could increase or decrease the risk.
4.  **Vulnerability Database Research:** We will check for any publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to file uploads in Phabricator (CVEs, bug reports, etc.) to understand past issues and their resolutions.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Based on the findings from the above steps, we will refine and expand the initial mitigation strategies, providing specific code examples and configuration recommendations where possible.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

**2.1 Code Review (Static Analysis - Hypothetical Examples):**

Let's examine some *hypothetical* code snippets (simplified for illustration) and identify potential vulnerabilities.  These are *not* necessarily actual vulnerabilities in Phabricator, but examples of the *types* of issues we would look for.

**Example 1: Weak File Type Validation (PHP)**

```php
// Hypothetical Phabricator code (simplified)
$file = $_FILES['userfile'];
$extension = pathinfo($file['name'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION);

if ($extension == 'jpg' || $extension == 'png' || $extension == 'gif') {
  // Process the image
  move_uploaded_file($file['tmp_name'], '/var/www/phabricator/uploads/' . $file['name']);
} else {
  // Reject the file
}
```

**Vulnerability:** This code relies solely on the file extension for validation.  An attacker could easily bypass this by:

*   **Double Extensions:** Uploading a file named `malicious.php.jpg`.  Depending on server configuration (e.g., Apache's `AddHandler`), the server might execute the `.php` portion.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** Uploading a file named `malicious.php%00.jpg`.  The null byte (`%00`) might truncate the filename at that point, leaving only `malicious.php`.
*   **MIME Type Spoofing:**  The attacker can control the `Content-Type` header sent by their browser.  While this code doesn't directly use it, other parts of Phabricator might.
* **Lack of Content Inspection:** The code does not check the *actual* content of the file. An attacker could upload a PHP file with a `.jpg` extension, and if the server is misconfigured, it might be executed.

**Example 2: Insecure File Storage**

```php
// Hypothetical Phabricator code (simplified)
$filename = $_FILES['userfile']['name'];
$safe_filename = preg_replace('/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/', '_', $filename); // Basic sanitization
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], '/var/www/phabricator/webroot/uploads/' . $safe_filename);
```

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Files Stored in Web Root:**  The uploaded files are stored within the web root (`/var/www/phabricator/webroot/uploads/`).  This means that if an attacker can upload a malicious script (e.g., `shell.php`), they can directly access it via a URL (e.g., `https://phabricator.example.com/uploads/shell.php`).
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The `preg_replace` function only replaces non-alphanumeric characters, periods, and hyphens with underscores.  This might not be sufficient to prevent all path traversal attacks or other injection vulnerabilities.  For example, it doesn't handle multiple consecutive dots (`..`), which could be used for directory traversal.

**Example 3: Missing File Size Limit**

```php
// Hypothetical Phabricator code (simplified) - No size check
move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], '/path/to/uploads/' . $_FILES['userfile']['name']);
```

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could upload an extremely large file, consuming disk space and potentially causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.

**2.2 Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical Testing):**

Let's consider some hypothetical attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: RCE via Double Extension:** An attacker uploads a file named `exploit.php.jpg` to a Maniphest task.  The Phabricator server is configured (perhaps unintentionally) to execute `.php` files even if they have additional extensions.  The attacker then accesses the file via a crafted URL, triggering the execution of the PHP code and gaining control of the server.

*   **Scenario 2: Malware Distribution via Phriction:** An attacker uploads a malicious JavaScript file disguised as a `.png` image to a Phriction wiki page.  When other users view the page, the JavaScript executes in their browsers, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting them to phishing sites, or installing malware.

*   **Scenario 3: DoS via Large File Upload:** An attacker repeatedly uploads very large files to various parts of Phabricator, filling up the server's disk space and causing the application to become unavailable.

*   **Scenario 4: Path Traversal:** An attacker uploads a file with a name like `../../../../etc/passwd`. If the sanitization is flawed, and the file is stored in a location relative to the webroot, the attacker might be able to overwrite critical system files or access sensitive data.

**2.3 Configuration Review:**

Phabricator likely has configuration options related to file uploads.  We need to examine these:

*   **`storage.local.path`:**  This setting (or similar) likely controls where uploaded files are stored.  It should be set to a directory *outside* the web root.
*   **`storage.local.max-size` or similar:** This setting should enforce a reasonable maximum file size limit.
*   **`files.viewable-mime-types` and `files.editable-mime-types`:** These settings (or similar) might control which file types are allowed.  They should be configured with a strict whitelist approach.
*   **Virus Scanning Integration:**  Phabricator might have options to integrate with external virus scanning services (e.g., ClamAV).  These should be enabled if possible.
* **Security Headers:** Check if security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` are configured to prevent execution of inline scripts.

**2.4 Vulnerability Database Research:**

We would search vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NIST NVD, Exploit-DB) for known vulnerabilities in Phabricator related to file uploads.  This would provide valuable context and inform our analysis. For example, searching for "Phabricator file upload" would be a starting point.

**2.5 Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**

Based on the above analysis, we can refine the initial mitigation strategies:

**For Developers:**

1.  **Strict Whitelist Validation:**
    *   Use a whitelist of *allowed* MIME types, *not* a blacklist of disallowed types.
    *   Validate the MIME type using a reliable library (e.g., PHP's `finfo_file` or `mime_content_type`) *after* the file has been uploaded to the temporary directory.  Do *not* rely on the `$_FILES` array's `type` field, as this is provided by the client and can be spoofed.
    *   Example (PHP - Improved):

        ```php
        $allowed_mimes = [
            'image/jpeg',
            'image/png',
            'image/gif',
            'application/pdf', // Example: Allow PDFs
            // ... other allowed MIME types ...
        ];

        $file = $_FILES['userfile'];
        $finfo = finfo_open(FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE);
        $mime = finfo_file($finfo, $file['tmp_name']);
        finfo_close($finfo);

        if (in_array($mime, $allowed_mimes)) {
            // ... proceed with processing ...
        } else {
            // Reject the file and log the attempt
        }
        ```

2.  **Content Inspection:**
    *   For image files, consider using image processing libraries (e.g., ImageMagick, GD) to re-encode the image.  This can help to remove malicious code embedded within the image data.
    *   For other file types, consider using format-specific parsers to validate the file's structure and content.

3.  **Secure File Storage:**
    *   Store uploaded files *outside* the web root.
    *   Use randomly generated filenames to prevent attackers from guessing or predicting filenames.
    *   Set appropriate file permissions (e.g., `0600` or `0640`) to restrict access to the files.

4.  **Robust Filename Sanitization:**
    *   Use a more comprehensive sanitization routine that handles path traversal attempts (e.g., `..`, multiple slashes).
    *   Consider using a library specifically designed for filename sanitization.
    *   Example (PHP - using a hypothetical sanitization function):

        ```php
        $safe_filename = sanitize_filename($_FILES['userfile']['name']);
        ```

5.  **File Size Limits:**
    *   Enforce file size limits both in the PHP code and in the web server configuration (e.g., `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` in `php.ini`, and equivalent settings in Apache or Nginx).

6.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for all file upload operations.
    *   Log any failed upload attempts, including the filename, MIME type, and IP address of the uploader.  This can help with intrusion detection.

7.  **Regular Expression Review:** Carefully review any regular expressions used for filename sanitization or file type validation to ensure they are not vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.

**For Users/Administrators:**

1.  **Configure File Size Limits:** Set reasonable file size limits in Phabricator's configuration.
2.  **Enable Virus Scanning:** If possible, integrate Phabricator with an external virus scanning service.
3.  **Regular Updates:** Keep Phabricator up to date to ensure that any security vulnerabilities are patched promptly.
4.  **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review Phabricator's logs for any suspicious file upload activity.
5.  **Restrict File Types:** Use Phabricator's configuration options to restrict the allowed file types to the minimum necessary.
6.  **Secure Server Configuration:** Ensure that the web server (Apache, Nginx) is configured securely, including appropriate settings for handling file uploads and preventing directory traversal.
7. **Content Security Policy:** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks that might be facilitated by malicious file uploads.

### 3. Conclusion

Unvalidated file uploads represent a critical attack surface in Phabricator. By combining code review, hypothetical testing, configuration analysis, and vulnerability research, we can identify and mitigate potential weaknesses. The key is to implement multiple layers of defense, including strict file type validation, content inspection, secure file storage, robust filename sanitization, file size limits, and proper error handling.  Regular security audits and updates are crucial for maintaining a secure Phabricator installation. This deep analysis provides a framework for understanding and addressing this specific attack surface, contributing to a more secure overall application.
