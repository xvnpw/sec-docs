## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular Repository Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Diffusion](./mitigation_strategies/granular_repository_access_control_lists__acls__in_diffusion.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Granular Repository Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Diffusion
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Access Phabricator as Administrator:** Log in to your Phabricator instance using an account with administrator privileges.
    *   **Step 2: Navigate to Diffusion Application:** Go to the "Diffusion" application within Phabricator, which manages code repositories.
    *   **Step 3: Select Repository for Configuration:** Choose the specific repository within Diffusion you want to configure ACLs for.
    *   **Step 4: Access Repository Policies:**  Find and access the repository's "Policies" settings within Diffusion. This is usually located in the repository's admin or settings area.
    *   **Step 5: Configure View and Edit Policies:**  Within the Policies section, configure the "View Policy" and "Edit Policy" settings.
        *   **View Policy:** Restrict who can *view* the repository and its contents. Use projects, users, or roles to define authorized viewers.
        *   **Edit Policy:** Restrict who can *modify* the repository (push commits, create branches, etc.). Use projects, users, or roles to define authorized editors.
    *   **Step 6: Review and Refine Policies:** Carefully review the configured policies to ensure they accurately reflect the desired access control for the repository. Refine policies as needed to achieve granular control.
    *   **Step 7: Regular Audits and Updates:** Schedule regular audits of Diffusion repository ACLs to ensure they remain aligned with current team structures and project needs. Update policies as roles and responsibilities change within Phabricator.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Code Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing sensitive source code managed by Phabricator's Diffusion application.
    *   **Data Breach via Code Exposure (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by controlling who can view potentially sensitive information stored in Diffusion repositories.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Mitigates risks from internal users attempting to access code beyond their authorized scope within Phabricator.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification or Deletion (Medium Severity):** Restricting edit access in Diffusion reduces accidental or malicious modifications to code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Code Access: High Reduction
    *   Data Breach via Code Exposure: High Reduction
    *   Insider Threats: Medium Reduction
    *   Accidental Data Modification or Deletion: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within Phabricator Diffusion. ACLs are configured for top-level repositories, primarily based on Phabricator project membership.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  ACLs in Diffusion need to be refined for sub-projects and branches within repositories. Regular audits of Diffusion ACLs within Phabricator are not yet formally scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mandatory Code Review Processes using Differential](./mitigation_strategies/mandatory_code_review_processes_using_differential.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Mandatory Code Review Processes using Differential
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Configure Differential Workflow in Phabricator:** Access Phabricator's Differential application settings (often through "Config" or "Settings" in the Phabricator UI).
    *   **Step 2: Define Differential Review Rules:** Configure Differential to enforce code reviews for specific repositories managed by Phabricator. This is often done by configuring "Revision Acceptance Policies" within Differential.
    *   **Step 3: Mandate Reviewers in Differential:**  Set up rules in Differential that require a minimum number of reviewers (e.g., at least one or two Phabricator users) to approve a code revision before it can be accepted and landed.
    *   **Step 4: Integrate Differential with Branching Strategy:** Align Differential's code review enforcement with your branching strategy in Diffusion. For example, require reviews for all revisions targeting protected branches in Diffusion like `main` or `release`.
    *   **Step 5: Developer Training on Differential:** Train developers on using Phabricator's Differential for code reviews and emphasize secure coding practices during reviews. Provide guidelines for reviewers within the context of Differential.
    *   **Step 6: Monitor and Enforce Differential Reviews:** Monitor the code review process within Differential to ensure it is being followed. Use Phabricator's dashboards and reporting features in Differential to track review completion and identify deviations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of developers unintentionally introducing security vulnerabilities into code reviewed via Phabricator Differential.
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (High Severity):** Makes it harder for malicious insiders to inject malicious code through Phabricator Differential, as reviews are mandated.
    *   **Logic Errors and Bugs (Medium Severity):** Code reviews in Differential help identify general logic errors and bugs in code changes submitted through Phabricator.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Differential reviews can be used to ensure code adheres to security compliance standards and coding guidelines enforced within Phabricator workflows.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Introduction of Vulnerabilities: High Reduction
    *   Malicious Code Injection: High Reduction
    *   Logic Errors and Bugs: Medium Reduction
    *   Compliance Violations: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented using Phabricator Differential. Code reviews are encouraged in Differential but not strictly enforced for all branches. For critical branches, Differential reviews are generally practiced but not mandated by Phabricator tooling.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to configure Phabricator Differential to *mandate* code reviews for merges into protected branches. Implement automated checks within Phabricator workflows to prevent merges without sufficient Differential approvals.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement in Auth](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa__enforcement_in_auth.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using Phabricator Auth
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Enable MFA Providers in Phabricator Auth:** Access Phabricator's "Auth" application settings. Enable desired MFA providers supported by Phabricator Auth (e.g., Time-based One-Time Passwords - TOTP).
    *   **Step 2: Configure MFA Enforcement Policy in Auth:**  Define a policy within Phabricator Auth to enforce MFA for all users or specific user groups (e.g., administrators, developers accessing sensitive Phabricator projects). This is done through Auth's policy configuration.
    *   **Step 3: User Enrollment Process via Auth:** Guide users through the MFA enrollment process within Phabricator Auth. Provide instructions on setting up MFA using their chosen method within their Phabricator account settings.
    *   **Step 4: Test MFA Functionality in Auth:** Thoroughly test MFA functionality within Phabricator Auth to ensure it is working correctly for all users and login scenarios.
    *   **Step 5: User Communication and Training for Phabricator MFA:** Communicate the MFA implementation to all Phabricator users. Provide training and support on how to set up and use MFA within their Phabricator accounts.
    *   **Step 6: Account Recovery Procedures in Auth:** Establish clear account recovery procedures within Phabricator Auth for users who lose access to their MFA devices. Ensure these procedures are secure and prevent unauthorized Phabricator account access.
    *   **Step 7: Monitor MFA Usage in Auth Logs:** Monitor MFA login attempts and usage logs within Phabricator Auth to detect anomalies or potential issues related to Phabricator user authentication.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Significantly reduces the risk of Phabricator account takeover attacks by requiring MFA through Phabricator Auth.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources within Phabricator, protected by MFA enforced by Phabricator Auth.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** Limits lateral movement within the Phabricator system if a user's Phabricator account is compromised, due to MFA enforced by Auth.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account Takeover: High Reduction
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data: High Reduction
    *   Lateral Movement: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented in Phabricator Auth. MFA is not currently enforced for Phabricator users via Phabricator's Auth application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  MFA needs to be enabled and enforced for all Phabricator users using Phabricator Auth, especially administrators and developers. User enrollment and communication processes specific to Phabricator MFA need to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Updates and Patching of Phabricator](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_updates_and_patching_of_phabricator.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Updates and Patching of Phabricator
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Subscribe to Phabricator Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Phabricator's official security channels (mailing lists, release notes, etc.) to receive notifications about Phabricator security updates and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Step 2: Establish Phabricator Patching Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for checking for and applying Phabricator updates and security patches (e.g., monthly or quarterly, or immediately for critical Phabricator vulnerabilities).
    *   **Step 3: Staging Environment Testing for Phabricator Updates:** Before applying updates to the production Phabricator instance, thoroughly test them in a staging environment that mirrors the production Phabricator setup. This is crucial for Phabricator-specific configurations and extensions.
    *   **Step 4: Apply Phabricator Updates in Production:** After successful staging testing, apply the updates to the production Phabricator instance during a planned maintenance window. Follow Phabricator's update procedures.
    *   **Step 5: Post-Update Verification of Phabricator:** After applying Phabricator updates in production, verify that Phabricator is functioning correctly and that the security patches have been successfully applied to the Phabricator instance. Check Phabricator logs for errors.
    *   **Step 6: Document Phabricator Patching Process:** Document the Phabricator patching process, including Phabricator versions updated, dates of updates, and any issues encountered and resolved during the Phabricator update process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Phabricator Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the Phabricator software itself.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity - Reduced Exposure Window for Phabricator):** Timely patching of Phabricator reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities in Phabricator before patches are available.
    *   **Data Breaches and System Compromise via Phabricator (High Severity):** Mitigates the risk of data breaches and system compromise that could result from unpatched vulnerabilities in the Phabricator application being exploited.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Phabricator Vulnerabilities: High Reduction
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Phabricator): Medium Reduction (Reduced Exposure Window)
    *   Data Breaches and System Compromise via Phabricator: High Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for Phabricator. Updates are applied to Phabricator, but not on a strict, regularly scheduled basis. Staging environment testing for Phabricator updates is sometimes skipped for minor updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to establish a formal, documented Phabricator patching schedule and consistently use the staging environment for testing *all* Phabricator updates before production deployment. Focus specifically on Phabricator update procedures.
