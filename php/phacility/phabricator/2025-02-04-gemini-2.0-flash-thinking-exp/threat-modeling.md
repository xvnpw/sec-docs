# Threat Model Analysis for phacility/phabricator

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Password Reset Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_password_reset_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw specific to Phabricator's password reset process. They might manipulate password reset links, bypass email verification steps unique to Phabricator, or exploit time-based vulnerabilities in Phabricator's reset token generation to gain unauthorized access to another user's account without knowing their current password.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data within Phabricator, manipulation of projects, code, and tasks, potential data breaches, and disruption of development workflows.
    * **Affected Phabricator Component:** `Auth` application, specifically the password reset functionality and related code in Phabricator's authentication modules.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly update Phabricator:** Ensure the Phabricator instance is updated to the latest version, including all security patches that address authentication vulnerabilities.
        * **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all users to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords, making account takeover significantly harder even if a password reset vulnerability exists.
        * **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting Phabricator's authentication mechanisms and password reset flows to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities proactively.
        * **Strong Password Reset Policies:** Implement robust password reset policies, including using cryptographically secure random token generation, short token expiration times, and proper validation of reset requests to prevent manipulation.

## Threat: [Policy Bypass in Differential Code Review](./threats/policy_bypass_in_differential_code_review.md)

* **Description:** An attacker attempts to circumvent Phabricator's policy engine specifically within the Differential code review application. They might craft a seemingly benign code diff that, when merged, introduces malicious code or vulnerabilities due to flaws in Phabricator's policy enforcement logic or insufficient checks during the code review process. This bypass is specific to how Phabricator handles policies in the context of code changes.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the codebase, potential system compromise, data breaches stemming from vulnerabilities introduced, supply chain attacks if the compromised code is distributed, and erosion of trust in the code review process.
    * **Affected Phabricator Component:** `Differential` application, `Policy` application, specifically the integration and interaction between these components during the code review and merge process.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Code Review Processes:** Implement mandatory and rigorous code review processes involving multiple reviewers, including security-focused reviewers, to scrutinize all code changes, especially those from less trusted contributors.
        * **Static and Dynamic Analysis Security Tools:** Integrate automated static and dynamic analysis security tools into the code review workflow to automatically scan diffs for potential vulnerabilities before merging, supplementing manual review.
        * **Robust Policy Configuration and Auditing:**  Carefully configure and regularly audit Phabricator's policy rules related to code changes and merges to ensure they are effective and prevent unauthorized or malicious code introduction.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Code Merging:** Restrict code merging permissions to a limited number of trusted individuals and enforce separation of duties between code authors and code committers.

## Threat: [Sensitive Bug Information Disclosure in Maniphest](./threats/sensitive_bug_information_disclosure_in_maniphest.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive bug reports within the Maniphest application due to Phabricator-specific policy misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Maniphest's access control mechanisms. This allows them to view confidential information, security vulnerabilities details, or customer data contained within bug reports, which should have been restricted based on Phabricator's policy settings.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of security vulnerabilities making the system more vulnerable to attacks, reputational damage due to privacy violations, potential legal liabilities for mishandling sensitive information, and loss of competitive advantage if proprietary information is leaked.
    * **Affected Phabricator Component:** `Maniphest` application, `Policy` application, specifically the access control logic and policy enforcement within Maniphest for bug reports and their associated data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement Strict Access Control Policies in Maniphest:** Define and enforce granular access control policies for bug reports based on sensitivity, project membership, and user roles within Phabricator.
        * **Regular Policy Review and Auditing:** Regularly review and audit Maniphest's policy configurations to ensure they accurately reflect the intended access restrictions and are correctly implemented within Phabricator.
        * **Data Minimization and Anonymization:**  Minimize the amount of sensitive information stored directly in bug reports. Consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing sensitive data where possible, or storing it separately with stricter access controls.
        * **User Training on Data Sensitivity:** Train users on properly classifying bug reports based on sensitivity and adhering to data handling policies within Phabricator to prevent accidental oversharing or misclassification.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Phabricator Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_phabricator_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** Phabricator, like many web applications, relies on numerous third-party libraries and components. If vulnerabilities are discovered in these dependencies, and Phabricator is using vulnerable versions, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the Phabricator instance. This threat is specific to the dependencies *used by Phabricator* and the process of managing and updating them within the Phabricator ecosystem.
    * **Impact:** System compromise, potential remote code execution on the Phabricator server, data breach if attackers gain access to the database or file system, denial of service if vulnerabilities lead to instability, and further exploitation of connected systems if the Phabricator server is compromised.
    * **Affected Phabricator Component:** Phabricator core, third-party libraries and dependencies managed by Phabricator's dependency management system (if any), and the overall Phabricator installation environment.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly Update Phabricator and Dependencies:** Implement a process for regularly updating Phabricator itself and all its dependencies to the latest versions. This includes applying security patches promptly as they are released by Phabricator and its dependency providers.
        * **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools that can identify known vulnerabilities in Phabricator's dependencies. Integrate these tools into the development and deployment pipeline to proactively detect and remediate vulnerabilities.
        * **Dependency Management Practices:** Utilize robust dependency management practices to track and manage Phabricator's dependencies effectively. This includes using dependency lock files to ensure consistent builds and facilitate easier updates.
        * **Security Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up security monitoring and alerting for newly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting Phabricator's dependencies. Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Phabricator and its ecosystem to stay informed about potential risks.
