- Improve software quality through rigorous code review processes and bug tracking.
- Streamline project management and task coordination within development teams.
- Facilitate collaboration and communication among team members.
- Offer a self-hosted solution to organizations that require greater control over their development infrastructure and data.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Data breaches and leaks of sensitive source code, project information, and user data.
- Service disruption and unavailability impacting development workflows and project timelines.
- Compliance violations if handling regulated data without adequate security controls.
- Loss of intellectual property due to unauthorized access or exfiltration.
- Reputational damage and loss of customer trust in case of security incidents.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Web application framework with built-in security features (framework details need to be investigated in the repository).
- security control: Database access controls to manage user permissions and data access.
- security control: Potentially uses HTTPS for communication encryption (needs verification).
- security control: Likely has authentication mechanisms for user login (needs investigation of supported methods).
- security control: Authorization mechanisms to control access to different features and projects (needs investigation of granularity and implementation).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components used by Phabricator.
- accepted risk: Risks associated with self-hosting, requiring organizations to manage their own infrastructure security.
- accepted risk: Configuration errors during deployment and operation that could lead to security weaknesses.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement a robust Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) incorporating security reviews, static and dynamic code analysis, and penetration testing.
- security control: Regularly perform vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of the Phabricator application and infrastructure.
- security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
- security control: Employ intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor and protect the infrastructure.
- security control: Implement security information and event management (SIEM) for logging and security monitoring.
- security control: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts, especially for administrators.
- security control: Regularly update and patch Phabricator and underlying infrastructure components.
- security control: Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to prevent sensitive data exfiltration.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Secure authentication mechanism to verify user identity.
    - security requirement: Support for strong password policies and password management.
    - security requirement: Consider integration with existing organizational identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, SAML, OAuth).
    - security requirement: Implement session management to securely handle user sessions.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions based on roles (e.g., administrator, developer, project manager).
    - security requirement: Fine-grained authorization to control access to specific projects, repositories, and features.
    - security requirement: Principle of least privilege should be enforced throughout the application.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - security requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to mitigate risks from malicious input.
    - security requirement: Implement output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - security requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys.
    - security requirement: Protect sensitive data in transit using HTTPS/TLS for all communication.
    - security requirement: Consider encryption of sensitive data at rest in the database and file storage.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer develops code changes on their local workstation.
2. Code changes are committed and pushed to the Code Repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
3. CI/CD Pipeline is triggered by code changes in the repository (e.g., using webhooks).
4. Build Server in the CI/CD pipeline checks out the code.
5. SAST Scanner (Static Application Security Testing) performs static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
6. Dependency Check tool analyzes project dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
7. Test Suites are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
8. If all checks pass, the Build Server builds the application artifacts (e.g., deployable packages, container images).
9. Artifact Repository securely stores the build artifacts.

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Secure access control to the Code Repository, limiting who can commit and modify code.
- security control: Use of a dedicated Build Server in a controlled environment, minimizing exposure to developer workstations.
- security control: Integration of SAST Scanner into the build pipeline to automatically detect code vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
- security control: Dependency Check to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies, ensuring supply chain security.
- security control: Automated Test Suites to verify code functionality and prevent regressions, including security-related tests.
- security control: Secure Artifact Repository with access controls to protect build artifacts from unauthorized access and modification.
- security control: Code signing of build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- security control: Audit logging of build process activities for monitoring and security analysis.
