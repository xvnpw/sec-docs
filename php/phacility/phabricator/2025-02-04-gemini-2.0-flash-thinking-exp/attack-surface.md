# Attack Surface Analysis for phacility/phabricator

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_rendering.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users through vulnerabilities in Markdown and custom markup rendering.
*   **Phabricator Contribution:** Phabricator's core functionality relies on Markdown and its custom markup for user-generated content. Weaknesses in parsing and sanitizing these markups are direct Phabricator vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Malicious Javascript embedded in a Markdown comment within a Maniphest task executes when viewed by another user, potentially stealing session cookies.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Keep Phabricator Updated:** Regularly update Phabricator to the latest version to patch known XSS vulnerabilities in Markdown rendering.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and strictly configure Phabricator's CSP to limit script sources and mitigate XSS impact.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Ensure robust sanitization of user inputs and proper output encoding during Markdown rendering to neutralize malicious scripts.
        *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on Markdown and custom markup rendering to identify and fix potential XSS vectors.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass via Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_via_insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to resources by directly manipulating object identifiers (IDs) due to insufficient authorization checks in Phabricator's access control.
*   **Phabricator Contribution:** Phabricator's architecture relies on object IDs for accessing tasks, revisions, and other entities. Weak authorization checks when accessing objects via IDs are a direct Phabricator vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A user without permission to view a Differential revision (D123) directly accesses `/D123` and gains unauthorized access because Phabricator fails to properly validate their permissions based on the revision ID.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive code, project information, and data. Potential privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Enforce Authorization Checks:** Implement mandatory authorization checks in Phabricator's code whenever accessing resources based on object IDs.
        *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs) / Policies:** Utilize Phabricator's built-in ACLs and policy mechanisms to define and rigorously enforce permissions for all object types.
        *   **Opaque Identifiers:** Where possible, avoid exposing direct internal object IDs in URLs. Consider using opaque or hashed identifiers to obscure direct object references.
        *   **Authorization Testing:** Perform thorough authorization testing for all functionalities, especially those involving object access via IDs, to identify and rectify IDOR vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities leading to Remote Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Phabricator's file upload features to upload and execute malicious code on the server due to inadequate file validation and handling.
*   **Phabricator Contribution:** Phabricator's modules like Maniphest and Differential allow file uploads. Insufficient file validation and insecure storage practices within Phabricator directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image through a Maniphest task's file upload. If Phabricator doesn't properly validate the file and stores it in a web-accessible location, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by accessing the web shell URL.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict File Type Validation:** Implement robust file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not solely on file extensions within Phabricator's file upload handling logic.
        *   **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web root directory to prevent direct execution via web requests. Configure Phabricator's file storage settings accordingly.
        *   **Web Server Configuration:** Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to prevent script execution within the file upload directory using directives like `.htaccess` or server configuration blocks.
        *   **File Size Limits:** Implement and enforce file size limits in Phabricator to prevent denial of service attacks through excessively large file uploads.
        *   **Malware Scanning:** Integrate malware scanning of uploaded files using antivirus or anti-malware solutions to detect and block malicious uploads.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in Phabricator's API authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access or actions via the API.
*   **Phabricator Contribution:** Phabricator provides a comprehensive API. Vulnerabilities in how Phabricator manages API keys, enforces access control, and handles rate limiting are direct API security flaws within Phabricator itself.
*   **Example:** A leaked API key allows an attacker to bypass web interface restrictions and access sensitive data or modify configurations directly through the API, or lack of API rate limiting allows brute-force attacks.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, denial of service, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure API Key Management:** Implement secure generation, storage, and rotation of Phabricator API keys. Avoid default or weak API key generation methods.
        *   **API Authentication Enforcement:** Mandate strong authentication for all Phabricator API endpoints.
        *   **Granular API Authorization:** Implement fine-grained authorization controls for API access within Phabricator, ensuring users and applications only have access to necessary API resources and actions based on their roles and permissions.
        *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement API rate limiting and throttling within Phabricator to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, and denial of service attempts targeting the API.
        *   **HTTPS for API Communication:** Enforce HTTPS for all API communication to protect API keys and sensitive data transmitted over the network.
        *   **API Access Auditing:** Regularly audit Phabricator API access logs to monitor for suspicious activity and detect potential unauthorized access or misuse.
