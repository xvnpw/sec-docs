    *   **Reduced Residual Risk:** Minimizes the risk of unresolved vulnerabilities.

#### 4.6. Threats Mitigated and Impact Assessment

The identified threats mitigated by regular security audits are accurate and relevant:

*   **Undetected Security Weaknesses (Medium to High Severity):**  This is the primary threat addressed. Regular audits are the most effective way to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities that might otherwise remain hidden and exploitable. The impact reduction is appropriately rated as Medium to High, as undetected weaknesses can lead to significant breaches.
*   **Compliance Violations (Medium Severity):** Audits help ensure ongoing compliance with security policies and regulations. The impact reduction is Medium, as compliance violations can lead to legal and financial repercussions, as well as reputational damage.
*   **Accumulation of Security Debt (Medium Severity):** Regular audits prevent the accumulation of security debt by addressing issues proactively.  The impact reduction is Medium, as accumulated security debt can make systems increasingly vulnerable and difficult to maintain securely over time.

#### 4.7. Currently Implemented and Missing Implementation (Placeholders)
