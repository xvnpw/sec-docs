## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Input Validation and Output Encoding in Phabricator Development](./mitigation_strategies/implement_input_validation_and_output_encoding_in_phabricator_development.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Input Validation and Output Encoding in Phabricator Development
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Input Validation on Server-Side (Phabricator Code):**  Within Phabricator's codebase (if developing custom features or extensions), implement robust server-side input validation for all user inputs received by Phabricator applications. Validate data type, format, length, and range to ensure inputs conform to expected values. Reject invalid inputs and provide informative error messages.
    2.  **Output Encoding (Phabricator Templating):** When displaying user-generated content or data retrieved from databases within Phabricator web pages, use proper output encoding techniques provided by Phabricator's templating engine (e.g., Phabricator's `javelin_render_tag` or similar mechanisms). Encode outputs appropriately for the context (e.g., HTML encoding for display in HTML, URL encoding for URLs, JavaScript encoding for embedding in JavaScript).
    3.  **Educate Developers on Secure Coding Practices:** Provide security awareness training to developers working on Phabricator customizations or extensions, emphasizing secure coding practices related to input validation and output encoding within the Phabricator development environment.
    4.  **Code Reviews for Security:** Conduct security-focused code reviews for all Phabricator code changes, specifically looking for proper input validation and output encoding implementations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Output encoding prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into Phabricator pages that could be executed in other users' browsers.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Input validation helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into database queries through user inputs.
    *   **Other Injection Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Input validation and output encoding can also mitigate other types of injection vulnerabilities, such as command injection or LDAP injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Risk Reduction
