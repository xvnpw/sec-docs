## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation *Before* `nikic/php-parser` Parsing](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_before__nikicphp-parser__parsing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Expected PHP Input:** Clearly define the expected structure and syntax of PHP code that your application intends to parse using `nikic/php-parser`.  Identify the specific PHP features and constructs that are necessary for your application's functionality.
    2.  **Implement Pre-Parsing Checks:** Before feeding any input to `nikic/php-parser`, implement validation and sanitization steps to filter potentially malicious or unexpected code. This can include:
        *   **File Type Validation (if applicable):** Verify file extensions and MIME types to ensure only intended PHP files are processed by `nikic/php-parser`.
        *   **File Size Limits:** Restrict the size of input files to prevent resource exhaustion during parsing by `nikic/php-parser`.
        *   **Syntax Whitelisting (advanced):** If your application only needs to parse a limited subset of PHP syntax, implement checks to ensure the input code conforms to this allowed syntax before parsing with `nikic/php-parser`.
        *   **Content Filtering (context-dependent):**  Based on your application's logic, filter or reject input code that contains unexpected or potentially dangerous PHP constructs *before* it reaches `nikic/php-parser`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Triggering `nikic/php-parser` Bugs with Malformed Input (Medium to High Severity):**  Unexpected or maliciously crafted PHP code input could trigger undiscovered bugs or edge cases within `nikic/php-parser` itself. Sanitization aims to reduce the likelihood of providing input that could exploit such parser vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Input to `nikic/php-parser` (Medium Severity):**  Extremely complex or deeply nested PHP code can consume excessive resources *during parsing by `nikic/php-parser`*, leading to DoS. Input validation, especially file size limits, helps mitigate this.

*   **Impact:** Partially reduces the risk of triggering bugs *within `nikic/php-parser`* and DoS related to parser resource consumption. Provides a defense layer against unexpected input that could cause issues with the parser.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic file type validation for uploaded files. File size limits are partially implemented. No specific syntax whitelisting or advanced content filtering for `nikic/php-parser` input.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  More comprehensive input validation rules tailored to the expected PHP syntax for `nikic/php-parser` parsing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for `nikic/php-parser` Parsing Operations](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for__nikicphp-parser__parsing_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **PHP Execution Limits:** Configure PHP's `max_execution_time` and `memory_limit` settings to restrict the resources available to PHP scripts, including those using `nikic/php-parser`.
    2.  **Application-Level Timeouts:** Implement timeouts within your application code specifically for `nikic/php-parser` parsing operations. If parsing exceeds a defined time limit, terminate the process.
    3.  **Process Isolation (Advanced):** For parsing highly untrusted PHP code with `nikic/php-parser`, consider isolating the parsing process in a separate process or container with restricted resource allocation. This limits the impact of resource exhaustion or potential exploits *related to the parser* on the main application.
    4.  **Resource Monitoring for Parsing:** Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) specifically during `nikic/php-parser` parsing operations. Set up alerts for unusual resource consumption patterns that might indicate a DoS attempt targeting the parser.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through `nikic/php-parser` Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Maliciously crafted PHP code can be designed to cause `nikic/php-parser` to consume excessive CPU or memory during parsing, leading to DoS and application unavailability.
    *   **Slowloris-style DoS targeting `nikic/php-parser` (Medium Severity):** Attackers might send a stream of incomplete or very slow PHP code snippets to keep `nikic/php-parser` parsing processes busy and exhaust server resources over time. Timeouts and execution time limits mitigate this.

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks that exploit resource consumption *during `nikic/php-parser` parsing*. Limits the impact of resource-intensive parsing and prevents indefinite hanging of parsing processes.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Default PHP resource limits are in place. Application-level timeouts for `nikic/php-parser` parsing are not explicitly implemented. Process isolation is not used for parsing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Fine-tuning PHP resource limits specifically for parsing processes. Implementation of application-level timeouts for `nikic/php-parser` parsing.
