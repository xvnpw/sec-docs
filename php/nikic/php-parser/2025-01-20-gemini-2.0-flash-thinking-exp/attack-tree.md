## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using php-parser [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_php-parser__critical_node_.md)

* **Compromise Application Using php-parser [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate objective of the threat model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parser Weakness [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parser_weakness__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit Parser Weakness [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This branch focuses on vulnerabilities within the `nikic/php-parser` library itself. Exploiting these weaknesses can directly lead to severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Parser Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__via_parser_vulnerability__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Parser Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This is the most critical threat. If an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, they have full control.

    * **Exploit Unsafe Deserialization of Parser Objects [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * If the application serializes and unserializes objects from the parser, vulnerabilities in the `__wakeup` or `__destruct` magic methods could be exploited. An attacker could supply a malicious serialized object that, upon unserialization, executes arbitrary code.

    * **Trigger Buffer Overflow in Parser Logic [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * While PHP generally handles memory management, vulnerabilities in the underlying C code (if any) or in how the parser handles string manipulation could lead to buffer overflows. By providing carefully crafted PHP code exceeding buffer limits, an attacker could overwrite memory and potentially gain control.

    * **Exploit Vulnerability in Tokenizer [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * The tokenizer breaks down the PHP code into tokens. A flaw here could lead to incorrect tokenization, which could be exploited to inject malicious code or cause unexpected behavior. For example, providing input that tricks the tokenizer into misinterpreting keywords or operators.

    * **Exploit Vulnerability in AST Building Logic [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * The parser constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens. Vulnerabilities in this stage could allow manipulation of the AST to inject malicious code or cause unexpected behavior when the application processes the AST.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe Deserialization of Parser Objects [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe_deserialization_of_parser_objects__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Unsafe Deserialization of Parser Objects [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * If the application serializes and unserializes objects from the parser, vulnerabilities in the `__wakeup` or `__destruct` magic methods could be exploited. An attacker could supply a malicious serialized object that, upon unserialization, executes arbitrary code.

By providing carefully crafted PHP code exceeding buffer limits, an attacker could overwrite memory and potentially gain control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Tokenizer [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_tokenizer__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in AST Building Logic [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_ast_building_logic__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerability in AST Building Logic [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * The parser constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens. Vulnerabilities in this stage could allow manipulation of the AST to inject malicious code or cause unexpected behavior when the application processes the AST.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Parser [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__via_parser__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Parser [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * Making the application unavailable is a significant impact.

    * **Trigger Infinite Loop in Parsing Logic [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Crafted PHP code could exploit flaws in the parser's logic, causing it to enter an infinite loop and consume server resources, leading to a DoS. Specific combinations of language constructs or deeply nested structures might trigger this.

    * **Exhaust Memory During Parsing [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Providing extremely large or deeply nested PHP code could overwhelm the parser's memory allocation, leading to a crash or slowdown, effectively causing a DoS.

    * **Trigger Stack Overflow During Parsing [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Deeply nested structures in the PHP code could exceed the call stack limit during parsing, leading to a stack overflow and crashing the process.

* **Bypass Security Checks due to Parser Misinterpretation [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * If the parser interprets code differently than the application expects, security checks might be bypassed.

    * **Craft PHP Code Misinterpreted by Parser Leading to Bypass [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Utilizing ambiguous syntax or edge cases in PHP could lead to the parser producing an AST that doesn't accurately represent the intended code, allowing malicious code to slip through security checks that rely on the AST.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft PHP Code Misinterpreted by Parser Leading to Bypass [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_php_code_misinterpreted_by_parser_leading_to_bypass__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code via Parser Output [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * Even without direct vulnerabilities, the parser's output (the AST) can be manipulated or misinterpreted by the application.

    * **Exploit Inconsistent Handling of Special Characters in Output [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * If the application uses the parser's output (e.g., when generating code or transforming it) and the parser handles special characters inconsistently, it could lead to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., if the output is used in a database query or shell command).

    * **Manipulate AST to Inject Code During Code Generation/Transformation [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * If the application uses the AST for code generation or transformation, an attacker might be able to influence the input code in a way that results in the AST being modified to include malicious code during the generation/transformation process.
