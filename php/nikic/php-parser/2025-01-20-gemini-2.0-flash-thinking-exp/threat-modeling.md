# Threat Model Analysis for nikic/php-parser

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Large Code](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_large_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large PHP code file to be parsed. The `PhpParser\Parser\Php7` component attempts to process the entire file, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application becomes unresponsive or crashes, potentially impacting other services on the same server.

**Affected Component:** `PhpParser\Parser\Php7::parse()`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a maximum file size limit for PHP code being parsed.
* Implement timeouts for the parsing operation.
* Consider using a separate process or container with resource limits for parsing untrusted code.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex Code Structures](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_code_structures.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts PHP code with deeply nested structures (e.g., nested loops, function calls, conditional statements) that cause the `PhpParser\NodeVisitorAbstract` and related visitor components to perform an excessive number of operations.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application becomes unresponsive or crashes.

**Affected Component:** `PhpParser\Parser\Php7::parse()`, `PhpParser\NodeTraverser`, `PhpParser\NodeVisitorAbstract`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts for the parsing operation.
* Consider static analysis tools to detect and reject overly complex code before parsing.
* If possible, simplify the code being parsed before processing.

## Threat: [Parser Logic Error Leading to Incorrect AST Representation](./threats/parser_logic_error_leading_to_incorrect_ast_representation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specific, potentially edge-case, PHP code that exposes a bug in the `PhpParser\Parser\Php7` component. This bug causes the parser to generate an incorrect Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that does not accurately represent the intended code logic.

**Impact:** Application logic that relies on the AST will behave unexpectedly or incorrectly, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities such as bypassing security checks or executing unintended actions.

**Affected Component:** `PhpParser\Parser\Php7::parse()`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `nikic/php-parser` library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Implement thorough testing of the application's logic with a wide range of PHP code samples, including edge cases and potentially malicious constructs.
* Perform validation on the generated AST to ensure it conforms to expected structures before using it in critical operations.

## Threat: [Parser Logic Error Leading to Unhandled Exception or Crash](./threats/parser_logic_error_leading_to_unhandled_exception_or_crash.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malformed or unexpected PHP code that triggers an unhandled exception or a crash within the `PhpParser\Lexer` or `PhpParser\Parser\Php7` components.

**Impact:** Application crashes or becomes unstable, potentially leading to denial of service or exposing error information.

**Affected Component:** `PhpParser\Lexer`, `PhpParser\Parser\Php7::parse()`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust error handling around the parsing process, catching potential exceptions thrown by the parser.
* Regularly update the `nikic/php-parser` library.
* Consider using a try-catch block specifically around the parsing operation.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Parser Vulnerabilities in Downstream Logic](./threats/exploitation_of_parser_vulnerabilities_in_downstream_logic.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability in the `PhpParser\Parser\Php7` component that leads to a subtly incorrect AST. The application logic, relying on assumptions about the parsed code based on this flawed AST, performs unintended actions. For example, the parser might misinterpret a function call, leading the application to execute a different function than intended.

**Impact:** Potential for code injection, privilege escalation, or other security breaches depending on how the AST is used in the application logic.

**Affected Component:** `PhpParser\Parser\Php7::parse()`

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `nikic/php-parser` library.
* Thoroughly validate the structure and content of the AST before using it in security-sensitive operations.
* Avoid making assumptions about the parsed code without explicit verification.
* Implement robust input validation on the parsed output before using it in application logic.
