# Attack Surface Analysis for nikic/php-parser

## Attack Surface: [Malicious PHP Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_php_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted PHP code as input to the parser, exploiting potential vulnerabilities in its parsing logic.
    *   **How php-parser Contributes:** The library's core function is to parse PHP code. If the parser has bugs or handles certain code constructs incorrectly, malicious code can be interpreted in unintended ways, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches in the application using the parser.
    *   **Example:**  Providing PHP code with deeply nested structures that trigger a stack overflow in the parser, or code exploiting a vulnerability in how the parser handles specific language features leading to incorrect AST generation that is later exploited by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (if the parsed AST is used to execute code), Denial of Service (if the parsing process crashes or consumes excessive resources), or bypassing security checks implemented based on the AST.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `nikic/php-parser` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides extremely large or complex PHP code that consumes excessive CPU and memory resources during the parsing process, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How php-parser Contributes:** The complexity of the parsing process can make it susceptible to resource exhaustion when handling very large or deeply nested code structures. The parser needs to allocate memory and perform computations based on the input code.
    *   **Example:** Providing a PHP file with thousands of nested `if` statements or an extremely long string literal.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, server overload, and potential crashes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement timeouts for the parsing process.
        *   Set resource limits (memory and CPU) for the parsing process.
        *   Analyze the complexity of the code being parsed and reject excessively complex inputs.
