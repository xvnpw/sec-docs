# Threat Model Analysis for nikic/php-parser

## Threat: [Malformed PHP Code Exploitation Leading to Crash](./threats/malformed_php_code_exploitation_leading_to_crash.md)

*   **Threat:** Malformed PHP Code Exploitation Leading to Crash
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides intentionally malformed or syntactically invalid PHP code. The `nikic/php-parser` attempts to parse this code and encounters an unhandled error or internal inconsistency, leading to a crash of the parsing process or the entire application. The vulnerability lies within the parser's error handling capabilities when faced with unexpected input.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or its parsing functionality. This can disrupt service availability and potentially lead to data loss if the crash occurs during a critical operation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Parsing Engine (specifically error handling within the parser).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust error handling around the parsing process. Catch exceptions thrown by the parser and handle them gracefully, preventing application crashes.
        *   Consider using the parser's built-in error recovery mechanisms, but be aware of their limitations and potential for unexpected behavior.

## Threat: [Recursive Parsing or Deeply Nested Structures Causing Resource Exhaustion](./threats/recursive_parsing_or_deeply_nested_structures_causing_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Recursive Parsing or Deeply Nested Structures Causing Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides PHP code with excessively deep nesting of language constructs. When the `nikic/php-parser` attempts to build the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for this code, it consumes excessive memory and processing time, potentially leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability resides in the parser's handling of deeply nested structures.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting server resources (CPU, memory). This can slow down or completely halt the application's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** AST Builder (the part of the parser responsible for constructing the Abstract Syntax Tree).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the depth of allowed nesting or the complexity of the parsed code. This might require custom checks before or during parsing.
        *   Configure any available parser settings related to recursion limits or maximum AST depth (while `nikic/php-parser` doesn't have explicit configuration for this, understanding the potential is key).
        *   Monitor resource usage during parsing operations and implement timeouts to prevent excessively long parsing processes.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Parser Bugs/Logic Flaws Leading to Incorrect AST](./threats/exploitation_of_parser_bugslogic_flaws_leading_to_incorrect_ast.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Parser Bugs/Logic Flaws Leading to Incorrect AST
    *   **Description:** The `nikic/php-parser` library might contain bugs or logical flaws in its parsing logic. An attacker could craft specific PHP code that exploits these flaws, causing the parser to generate an incorrect or unexpected Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The vulnerability lies within the core parsing logic of the library.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypasses if the application relies on the accuracy of the AST for security-sensitive operations, leading to flawed logic. Potential for information disclosure or manipulation depending on how the parsed output is used.
    *   **Affected Component:** Parsing Engine (the core logic responsible for interpreting PHP syntax and building the AST).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest versions of `nikic/php-parser` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Thoroughly test the application's behavior with a wide range of valid and potentially problematic PHP code, including edge cases and complex syntax.
        *   If using the parsed AST for security-critical decisions, exercise extreme caution and consider additional validation steps on the AST itself or the resulting application behavior.
