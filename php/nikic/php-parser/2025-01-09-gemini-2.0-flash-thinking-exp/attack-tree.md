## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Parser Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

* Objective: Leverage flaws within the `nikic/php-parser` library itself to compromise the application.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities within Parser Objects:
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High (Full system compromise)
        * Effort: High
        * Skill Level: High
        * Detection Difficulty: Low
        * Description: Attacker crafts malicious PHP code containing serialized objects that, when processed by the parser (if it uses deserialization internally), lead to arbitrary code execution. This targets potential weaknesses in how the parser handles object serialization.
    * Exploit Bugs in AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Handling:
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium to High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * Description: Attacker crafts specific PHP code that exploits bugs in the parser's logic for generating the Abstract Syntax Tree. This can lead to an incorrect or manipulated AST, which, if relied upon by the application, can introduce vulnerabilities or allow for malicious code injection.
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tokenizer/Lexer:
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High (Full system compromise)
        * Effort: High
        * Skill Level: High
        * Detection Difficulty: Low
        * Description: Attacker crafts input that causes the tokenizer (the component that breaks down the code into tokens) to misinterpret the code, potentially allowing for the injection of malicious code disguised as legitimate tokens.
    * Exploit Integer Overflows or Buffer Overflows in Parser Logic:
        * Likelihood: Very Low
        * Impact: High (Full system compromise)
        * Effort: Very High
        * Skill Level: Expert
        * Detection Difficulty: Low
        * Description: Attacker provides input that triggers memory corruption vulnerabilities (like integer or buffer overflows) within the parser's core logic, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)

* Objective: Gain the ability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application.
* Description: This node represents the successful exploitation of a vulnerability within the `nikic/php-parser` that allows the attacker to run their own code on the server. This is the ultimate goal for many attackers as it provides complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Inconsistent Parsing Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_inconsistent_parsing_behavior.md)

* Objective: Leverage differences in how `nikic/php-parser` interprets PHP code compared to the actual PHP interpreter to bypass security checks or introduce logic flaws.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Bypass Security Checks Based on Parser Output:
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High (Bypass security measures)
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
        * Description: Attacker crafts PHP code that is interpreted as safe by `nikic/php-parser` (allowing it to pass security checks based on the parser's output) but is interpreted as malicious by the actual PHP interpreter when executed. This allows the attacker to smuggle malicious code past security measures.

Critical Node: Craft PHP Code Parsed Differently by nikic/php-parser vs. PHP Interpreter

* Objective: Create PHP code that exhibits divergent parsing behavior between the static analysis provided by `nikic/php-parser` and the runtime interpretation by the PHP engine.
* Description: This critical node represents the attacker's ability to craft input that exploits the subtle differences in how the parser understands code versus how the PHP engine executes it. This divergence is the foundation for bypassing security checks and introducing unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Bypass Security Checks Based on Parser Output](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_bypass_security_checks_based_on_parser_output.md)

* Objective: Successfully circumvent security mechanisms within the application that rely on the output or analysis provided by `nikic/php-parser`.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Input appears safe to parser but executes maliciously:
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High (Bypass security measures)
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
        * Description: This is the realization of the inconsistent parsing attack. The attacker successfully crafts code that the parser deems safe, allowing it to pass validation or sanitization, but the PHP interpreter executes it with malicious intent.
