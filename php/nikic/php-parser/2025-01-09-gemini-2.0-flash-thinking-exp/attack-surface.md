# Attack Surface Analysis for nikic/php-parser

## Attack Surface: [Parser Exploits and Bugs](./attack_surfaces/parser_exploits_and_bugs.md)

* **Description:**  `php-parser` itself might contain bugs or vulnerabilities in its parsing logic. Attackers can craft specific PHP code structures that trigger these vulnerabilities.
    * **How php-parser Contributes:**  The core functionality of `php-parser` is parsing PHP code. Bugs in this parsing logic are direct vulnerabilities within the library.
    * **Example:** A specially crafted PHP code snippet with deeply nested structures or unusual combinations of language features could cause `php-parser` to crash, enter an infinite loop, or consume excessive resources.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (parser crashes or hangs), unexpected behavior in the application due to incorrect AST generation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the bug and its exploitability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Updates:**  Immediately update to the latest version of `php-parser` to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around the parsing process to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent application crashes.
        * **Resource Limits:**  Impose limits on the size and complexity of the code being parsed to mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

* **Description:**  Providing extremely large or deeply nested PHP code to `php-parser` can consume excessive memory or CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
    * **How php-parser Contributes:** The parsing process itself requires computational resources. Maliciously crafted, very large, or deeply nested code can exploit the parser's resource consumption.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a very large PHP file or a file with thousands of nested control structures to an application that uses `php-parser` to analyze it. This could overwhelm the server's resources.
    * **Impact:** Application slowdown, temporary unavailability, or complete server crash.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Size Limits:**  Restrict the maximum size of the PHP code that can be processed.
        * **Parsing Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for the parsing process to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources (CPU, memory) and set up alerts for unusual spikes during parsing operations.
