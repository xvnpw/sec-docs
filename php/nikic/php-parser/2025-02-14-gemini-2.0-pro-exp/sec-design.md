# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust and reliable PHP parser written in PHP.
*   Enable static analysis tools for PHP code.
*   Facilitate code refactoring and manipulation tools.
*   Support multiple PHP versions.
*   Maintain high performance and low memory consumption.
*   Provide clear and well-documented API.
*   Foster an active and engaged community.

Business Risks:

*   Inability to parse valid PHP code (correctness risk).
*   Incorrect parsing of valid PHP code (correctness risk).
*   Vulnerabilities in the parser that could be exploited by malicious code (security risk).
*   Performance bottlenecks that limit the parser's usefulness in large projects (performance risk).
*   Lack of support for new PHP versions, leading to obsolescence (maintenance risk).
*   Difficult to use API, limiting adoption (usability risk).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project uses a lexer (tokenizer) and a parser generator (nikic/php-parser itself relies on a grammar). This separation of concerns helps to reduce the attack surface.
*   security control: The project includes an extensive test suite that covers a wide range of PHP code, including edge cases and potential security vulnerabilities. (test suite in /test directory)
*   security control: The project is widely used, which means that it has been tested by a large number of users and developers, increasing the likelihood that vulnerabilities have been found and fixed.
*   security control: The project is open source, which allows for public scrutiny of the code and encourages contributions from security researchers.
*   security control: The project follows semantic versioning, which helps users to understand the impact of updates and to avoid breaking changes.
*   accepted risk: The parser may be vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if it is given extremely large or complex input.
*   accepted risk: The parser may not be able to handle all possible PHP code, especially code that uses obscure or deprecated features.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement fuzz testing to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Integrate static analysis tools into the development workflow to catch potential security issues early.
*   security control: Consider using a memory-safe language for performance-critical parts of the parser to mitigate memory corruption vulnerabilities. (This is a major architectural change and may not be feasible).
*   security control: Develop a security policy that outlines how vulnerabilities are reported, handled, and disclosed.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as the parser is a library, not a service.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as the parser is a library, not a service.
*   Input Validation: The parser must handle a wide range of inputs, including potentially malicious code. The lexer and parser should be designed to be robust against invalid or unexpected input. The parser should reject code that does not conform to the PHP grammar.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, although the parser may be used to analyze code that uses cryptography.
*   Error Handling: The parser should handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages. Errors should not expose sensitive information or lead to crashes.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- Commits Code --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHub -- Triggers --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    GitHubActions -- Runs --> TestSuite["Test Suite"]
    GitHubActions -- Runs --> StaticAnalysis["Static Analysis (Psalm, Phan)"]
    GitHubActions -- "If Tests Pass" --> Artifact["Build Artifact (Composer Package)"]
    Artifact -- UploadedTo --> Packagist2["Packagist.org"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions is triggered by commits and pull requests.
3.  The GitHub Actions workflow runs the test suite (using PHPUnit).
4.  The workflow also runs static analysis tools (e.g., Psalm, Phan) to identify potential code quality and security issues.
5.  If all tests and static analysis checks pass, a build artifact (the Composer package) is created.
6.  The artifact is not directly uploaded to Packagist.org from CI. Releases are likely created manually by tagging a commit, which then triggers a separate process (not shown) to publish to Packagist.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Automated testing (PHPUnit) ensures code correctness and helps prevent regressions.
*   security control: Static analysis (Psalm, Phan) identifies potential code quality and security issues before deployment.
*   security control: GitHub Actions provides a consistent and reproducible build environment.
*   security control: Code review process (through pull requests) ensures that changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a reliable and accurate PHP parsing capability.
*   Enabling static analysis and code manipulation tools.

Data to Protect:

*   Source Code (Input): Sensitivity varies depending on the code being parsed. The parser itself doesn't store the code, but it processes it. The primary concern is not confidentiality, but integrity – ensuring the parser correctly interprets the code.
*   Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) (Output): Similar to the source code, the sensitivity depends on the original code. Again, integrity is the primary concern.
*   No user data or credentials are handled by the parser itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific performance targets or limitations for the parser?
*   Are there any plans to support parsing of other languages or dialects related to PHP (e.g., Hack)?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports?
*   Is there a specific coding standard or style guide that should be followed?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a robust and reliable PHP parser for use in other tools and projects.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project prioritizes correctness and security, but performance is also a significant concern.
*   DESIGN: The existing design using a lexer and parser generator is sound and should be maintained. The use of Composer for dependency management is standard practice.
