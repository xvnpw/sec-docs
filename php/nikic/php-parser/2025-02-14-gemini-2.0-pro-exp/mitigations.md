# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nikic/php-parser

## Mitigation Strategy: [AST Analysis and Validation (Post-Parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/ast_analysis_and_validation__post-parsing_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** AST Analysis and Validation (Post-Parsing)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Node Types:** Create a precise whitelist of allowed `PhpParser\Node` types.  This list should be as restrictive as possible, including *only* the node types absolutely necessary for the intended analysis or manipulation.  For example, if you're only analyzing function definitions, the whitelist might include `PhpParser\Node\Stmt\Function_`, `PhpParser\Node\Param`, `PhpParser\Node\Identifier`, etc., but *exclude* nodes like `PhpParser\Node\Expr\Eval_`, `PhpParser\Node\Expr\ShellExec`, `PhpParser\Node\Stmt\Class_`, etc.
    2.  **Node Visitor Implementation:** Create a custom class that implements `PhpParser\NodeVisitor`. This visitor will traverse the AST generated by `php-parser`.
    3.  **Whitelist Check (in `enterNode()`):**  Within the `enterNode(PhpParser\Node $node)` method of your custom `NodeVisitor`, check if the type of the current node (`$node->getType()`) is present in your predefined whitelist of allowed node types.
    4.  **Rejection (Exception/Error Handling):** If the node type is *not* in the whitelist, immediately reject the input.  This can be done by:
        *   Throwing a custom exception (e.g., `InvalidCodeStructureException`).
        *   Returning `NodeTraverser::DONT_TRAVERSE_CHILDREN` to stop further traversal of the current node's children.
        *   Returning `NodeTraverser::STOP_TRAVERSAL` to completely stop the AST traversal.
        *   Setting an error flag and returning.
        Choose the method that best integrates with your error handling strategy.  The key is to *prevent* any further processing of the invalid AST.
    5.  **Restrict Node Modification (in `leaveNode()`):** If you are modifying the AST (within the `leaveNode(PhpParser\Node $node)` method), be *extremely* cautious.  Only allow modifications that are strictly necessary and that *cannot* introduce new vulnerabilities.  For example, if you're renaming variables, ensure that the new names are validated and don't conflict with existing variables or keywords.  Avoid any modifications that could lead to code execution or other unintended behavior.
    6. **Data Flow Analysis (Advanced, within Visitor):** If you're performing data flow analysis (tracking the flow of data through the code), implement checks *within your NodeVisitor* to ensure that tainted data (from user input) doesn't influence the analysis in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. This is a more advanced technique and requires careful consideration of how data is tracked and used.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of RCE by preventing the analysis or manipulation of malicious code structures (e.g., `eval`, `system` calls) that are represented by specific AST node types.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the analysis of overly complex or deeply nested code structures (e.g., deeply nested arrays or loops) that could lead to resource exhaustion during AST traversal.
    *   **Application Logic Modification:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from subtly altering the application's logic by manipulating the AST in unauthorized ways (e.g., changing conditional statements, modifying function calls).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Moderately reduces risk by adding an extra layer of validation *after* parsing, specifically targeting the structured representation of the code.
    *   **DoS:** Moderately reduces risk by preventing the processing of overly complex ASTs that could consume excessive resources.
    *   **Application Logic Modification:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing unauthorized and potentially dangerous modifications to the AST.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `AstValidatorVisitor.php` implements the `PhpParser\NodeVisitor` interface and performs whitelist checks within `enterNode()`.
    *   Example: The `AstValidatorVisitor` is added to a `NodeTraverser` in `CodeAnalyzer.php` and run after the code is parsed using `ParserFactory`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Data flow analysis within the `NodeVisitor` is not yet implemented.
    *   Example: The whitelist of allowed node types in `AstValidatorVisitor.php` is not yet fully comprehensive and needs to be reviewed and expanded.
    *   Example: Restrictions on AST modification within `leaveNode()` are not yet fully implemented and documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Handling (Using `PrettyPrinter` Safely)](./mitigation_strategies/output_handling__using__prettyprinter__safely_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Output Handling (Using `PrettyPrinter` Safely)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`PrettyPrinter` Usage:** *Always* use `PhpParser\PrettyPrinter\Standard` (or a custom pretty printer that extends it) to generate PHP code from the AST.  *Never* manually construct PHP code by concatenating strings. The `PrettyPrinter` ensures that the generated code is syntactically correct and avoids common code injection vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Custom `PrettyPrinter` (If Necessary):** If you need to customize the code generation (e.g., to add specific formatting or comments), create a custom class that extends `PhpParser\PrettyPrinter\Standard`.  Override the specific methods you need to modify, but be *extremely careful* not to introduce any vulnerabilities.  Thoroughly review and test any custom pretty printing logic.
    3.  **Avoid `eval()` with Generated Code:**  *Absolutely never* use the generated code with PHP's `eval()` function.  This is inherently dangerous and bypasses many security protections. If you need to execute the generated code, use the sandboxing techniques described previously (but outside the scope of this `php-parser`-specific list).
    4. **Review Code Generation Logic:** Carefully examine the code that *uses* the `PrettyPrinter`. Ensure that the AST being passed to the `PrettyPrinter` is itself safe and hasn't been tampered with. This connects back to the AST validation strategy. The flow should be: Input Validation -> Parsing -> AST Validation -> (Optional AST Modification, with extreme caution) -> Pretty Printing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** (Severity: Critical) - By avoiding manual string concatenation and `eval()`, this strategy significantly reduces the risk of RCE vulnerabilities that could arise from improperly generated code.
    *   **Code Injection:** (Severity: High) - The `PrettyPrinter` ensures that the generated code is syntactically correct, preventing various forms of code injection that could exploit parsing flaws.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing the most common causes of RCE related to code generation.
    *   **Code Injection:** Significantly reduces risk by ensuring syntactic correctness and avoiding manual string manipulation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `CodeGenerator.php` uses `PhpParser\PrettyPrinter\Standard` exclusively to generate PHP code from the AST. The `$prettyPrinter->prettyPrintFile($ast)` method is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: A custom `PrettyPrinter` is planned for adding specific code comments, but it hasn't been implemented and thoroughly reviewed for security implications yet.
