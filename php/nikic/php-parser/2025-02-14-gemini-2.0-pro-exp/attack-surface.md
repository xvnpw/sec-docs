# Attack Surface Analysis for nikic/php-parser

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Recursion](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_recursion.md)

Maliciously crafted PHP code with deeply nested structures (e.g., deeply nested arrays, function calls, or class definitions) can cause the parser to consume excessive memory and CPU, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. PHP-Parser uses recursion to parse nested structures, and excessive recursion can exhaust the stack.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation](./attack_surfaces/input_validation.md)

The parser might be vulnerable to injection attacks if it doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before processing it. This could allow attackers to inject malicious code or manipulate the parsing process.

## Attack Surface: [Error Handling](./attack_surfaces/error_handling.md)

Improper error handling during parsing could expose sensitive information or create unexpected behavior. Attackers might exploit error messages or unexpected crashes to gain insights into the system or cause denial of service.

## Attack Surface: [External Entity Expansion (XXE)](./attack_surfaces/external_entity_expansion__xxe_.md)

If the parser processes XML input, it might be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. These attacks can allow attackers to read local files, access internal network resources, or cause denial of service.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

If the parser uses regular expressions, poorly crafted expressions could lead to catastrophic backtracking, causing excessive CPU consumption and denial of service.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

If the parser deserializes data from untrusted sources, it could be vulnerable to object injection attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Management Issues](./attack_surfaces/memory_management_issues.md)

Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or use-after-free errors in the parser's memory management could be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause crashes.

## Attack Surface: [Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependencies.md)

Vulnerabilities in any of the parser's dependencies (libraries or extensions) could be exploited to compromise the parser itself.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Errors](./attack_surfaces/configuration_errors.md)

Misconfigurations of the parser or its environment (e.g., overly permissive file permissions) could expose it to attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Side-Channel Attacks](./attack_surfaces/side-channel_attacks.md)

Timing attacks or other side-channel attacks could potentially be used to extract information about the parsed code or the system.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors.md)

Bugs in the parser's logic could lead to incorrect parsing, potentially resulting in security vulnerabilities if the parsed output is used in security-sensitive contexts.

## Attack Surface: [File Inclusion Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_inclusion_vulnerabilities.md)

If the parser allows including files based on user input, it could be vulnerable to local file inclusion (LFI) or remote file inclusion (RFI) attacks.
