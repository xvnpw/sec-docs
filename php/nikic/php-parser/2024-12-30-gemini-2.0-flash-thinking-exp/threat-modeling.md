* **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via AST Manipulation
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts PHP code that, when parsed by `nikic/php-parser`, results in an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that, when processed or used for code generation by the application, introduces malicious code or alters the intended logic. The attacker manipulates the input code to influence the structure of the AST in a way that the application's subsequent processing becomes vulnerable.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server, data breaches, defacement, or other malicious actions depending on how the application uses the generated AST.
    * **Affected Component:** `nikic/php-parser`'s `Parser` component (responsible for generating the AST).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Validation of AST Structure:** Implement robust checks on the generated AST before using it for any critical operations. Verify the types and properties of nodes to ensure they conform to expected patterns.
        * **Avoid Direct Code Generation from Untrusted AST:** If possible, avoid directly generating executable code based on the AST derived from untrusted input. Prefer safer alternatives or heavily sanitize the AST before code generation.

* **Threat:** Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion during Parsing
    * **Description:** An attacker provides extremely large, deeply nested, or complex PHP code as input. When `nikic/php-parser` attempts to parse this code, it consumes excessive CPU, memory, or other resources, leading to a denial of service for the application. The attacker exploits the parser's computational complexity with specially crafted input.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, server overload, potential crashes, and inability for legitimate users to access the application.
    * **Affected Component:** `nikic/php-parser`'s `Lexer` (tokenization) and `Parser` components (building the AST).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Size Limits:** Implement strict limits on the size of the PHP code that can be parsed.
        * **Parsing Timeouts:** Set timeouts for the parsing process. If parsing takes too long, terminate the process.
        * **Resource Limits for Parsing:** Configure resource limits (e.g., memory limits) specifically for the parsing process.
