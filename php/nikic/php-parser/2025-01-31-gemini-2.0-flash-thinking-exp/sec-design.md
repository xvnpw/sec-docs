# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, php-parser, provides a PHP parser library. The primary business goal is to offer a robust, reliable, and accurate tool for parsing PHP code. This library serves as a foundational component for various software development tools and applications that need to understand, analyze, or manipulate PHP code programmatically.

Business priorities include:
- Accuracy: The parser must correctly interpret the PHP language syntax to ensure tools built upon it function as expected.
- Performance:  Efficient parsing is crucial for tools that need to process large volumes of PHP code quickly.
- Compatibility:  Support for various PHP versions is important to cater to a wide range of users and projects.
- Maintainability:  The library should be easy to maintain and update to address bug fixes, security vulnerabilities, and support for new PHP language features.
- Community Adoption:  Widespread adoption by the PHP development community enhances the library's value and sustainability.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Incorrect parsing:  Bugs in the parser can lead to misinterpretations of PHP code, causing malfunctions in tools that rely on it.
- Security vulnerabilities in the parser:  Exploitable vulnerabilities in the parser itself could be leveraged to attack applications that use it to process untrusted PHP code.
- Lack of maintenance:  If the library is not actively maintained, it may become outdated, incompatible with newer PHP versions, and vulnerable to security issues.
- Performance bottlenecks:  Inefficient parsing can slow down tools and applications, impacting user experience.
- Limited adoption:  Low adoption can hinder the library's long-term viability and limit its impact on the PHP ecosystem.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code review - The project is open source and hosted on GitHub, allowing for community code review. (Implemented on GitHub)
- security control: Static analysis -  Likely used by developers during development, although not explicitly stated in the repository. (Developer responsibility)
- security control: Unit testing -  The repository includes a test suite, indicating unit testing is performed. (Implemented in repository's test suite)
- security control: Open source - Transparency of open source allows for public scrutiny and vulnerability reporting. (Nature of open source project)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities -  The project depends on PHP itself and potentially development tools. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are an accepted risk.
- accepted risk:  Community reported vulnerabilities - Reliance on community reporting for vulnerability discovery introduces a delay between vulnerability introduction and discovery.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Automated static analysis - Integrate automated static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify potential security vulnerabilities in code changes.
- security control: Dependency scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to detect and alert on known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
- security control: Fuzz testing -  Consider incorporating fuzz testing to discover edge cases and potential vulnerabilities related to parsing complex or malformed PHP code.
- security control: Security focused code review -  Incorporate security focused code review practices, specifically looking for common parsing vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, denial of service).
- security control: Vulnerability disclosure policy -  Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable - As a library, php-parser does not handle user authentication.
- Authorization: Not applicable - As a library, php-parser does not handle user authorization.
- Input validation: security requirement: Robust input validation is critical. The parser must be able to handle various forms of PHP code, including potentially malicious or malformed input, without crashing or exhibiting unexpected behavior. Input validation should be performed during the parsing process to ensure that the input conforms to the expected PHP syntax and structure.
- Cryptography: Not applicable -  As a parser, php-parser itself does not directly implement or require cryptography. However, it may parse PHP code that uses cryptography.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Providing a reliable and accurate PHP parsing library.  The core business process is the development, maintenance, and distribution of the php-parser library itself.  Its reliability and accuracy are paramount for its users.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of the php-parser library:  Sensitivity is moderate.  While open source, unauthorized modification or corruption of the source code could lead to vulnerabilities or backdoors in the library, impacting all users.
- Build artifacts (PHP library package): Sensitivity is high.  Compromised build artifacts distributed through package registries could directly introduce malware or vulnerabilities into user applications, representing a significant supply chain risk.
- Development and build infrastructure: Sensitivity is high.  Compromise of developer machines or the CI/CD pipeline could lead to unauthorized code changes or compromised build artifacts.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
