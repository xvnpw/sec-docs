## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in php-parser (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_php-parser__critical_node_.md)

*   **1.1. Parser Bugs (Code Execution/Logic Errors) (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   This is a critical area because bugs in the parser can directly lead to unexpected behavior, including code execution or logic errors that can be exploited.

    *   **1.1.1.1. Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Parser Logic (e.g., handling long strings, nested structures) [HIGH-RISK PATH - Potential]**
        *   **Action:** Provide crafted PHP code with excessively long strings or deeply nested structures.
        *   **Insight:** PHP's memory management reduces the likelihood, but C extensions used by the parser could be vulnerable. Exploiting this could lead to memory corruption and potentially Remote Code Execution.
        *   **Mitigation:** Regular updates of php-parser and PHP itself. Fuzz testing of php-parser with edge cases.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

    *   **1.1.4. Unhandled Exceptions/Errors Leading to Information Disclosure or DoS [SIGNIFICANT RISK AREA]**
        *   This is a significant risk area because it is relatively easy to trigger and can impact application availability and potentially reveal sensitive information.

        *   **1.1.4.1. Parser crashes or throws exceptions on malformed input, revealing internal paths or configurations. [SIGNIFICANT RISK AREA]**
            *   **Action:** Provide intentionally malformed PHP code to trigger exceptions.
            *   **Insight:** Error messages might leak sensitive information (path disclosure). Unhandled exceptions can cause application crashes (DoS).
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling in the application when using php-parser. Avoid displaying raw error messages to users.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
            *   **Impact:** Low to Medium
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

        *   **1.1.4.2. Resource Exhaustion due to deeply nested structures or very large code (DoS) [SIGNIFICANT RISK AREA]**
            *   **Action:** Provide extremely large or deeply nested PHP code to consume excessive memory or CPU during parsing.
            *   **Insight:** Can lead to Denial of Service by exhausting server resources.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement resource limits (memory, execution time) for php-parser within the application. Input size limits.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Application Logic Flaws Based on Parser Output (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_application_logic_flaws_based_on_parser_output__critical_node_.md)

*   **2.1. Code Injection via Unsafe Handling of Parsed Code [HIGH-RISK PATH] (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   This is a critical path because it directly leads to Remote Code Execution, the most severe outcome.

    *   **2.1.1. Application Evaluates or Executes Code Based on AST without Proper Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Action:** Provide PHP code that, when parsed and processed by the application, leads to execution of attacker-controlled code.
        *   **Insight:** If the application uses the AST to dynamically generate or execute code (even in a "sandbox" that is not robust), vulnerabilities in parser or application logic can lead to code injection.
        *   **Mitigation:** Avoid dynamic code execution based on parsed code if possible. If necessary, use robust sandboxing techniques *independent* of php-parser's output. Thoroughly sanitize and validate any code generated from AST.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Critical
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

    *   **2.1.2. Application Uses Parsed Code to Construct Commands/SQL Queries without Proper Escaping [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Action:** Provide PHP code that, when parsed and processed, results in the application constructing malicious commands or SQL queries.
        *   **Insight:** If the application extracts data from the AST (e.g., function names, variable names) and uses it in system commands or SQL queries without proper escaping, injection vulnerabilities (Command Injection, SQL Injection) can occur.
        *   **Mitigation:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for SQL. Use safe APIs for system commands. Never directly embed data extracted from AST into commands or queries without rigorous sanitization and validation.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **2.2.1. Security Checks Based on Flawed AST Analysis [HIGH-RISK PATH - Potential]**
    *   This path is potentially high-risk because if security relies solely on AST analysis, parser flaws or application logic errors in AST interpretation can lead to security bypasses.
        *   **Action:** Craft PHP code that bypasses security checks in the application because the application's AST analysis is incorrect or incomplete due to parser limitations or logic errors.
        *   **Insight:** If the application relies on the AST to enforce security policies (e.g., disallowing certain functions, limiting access to resources), parser bugs or application logic flaws can lead to bypasses.
        *   **Mitigation:** Do not rely solely on AST analysis for security. Implement defense-in-depth. Validate security policies using multiple layers of checks, not just AST inspection.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
