# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nikic/fastroute

## Mitigation Strategy: [Post-Match Input Validation and Sanitization (within FastRoute Handlers)](./mitigation_strategies/post-match_input_validation_and_sanitization__within_fastroute_handlers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Route Parameters:** Within your route handler functions (the callbacks you provide to `fast-route`), access the captured route parameters. These are typically provided as an array (e.g., `$vars` in the examples).
    2.  **Type Casting:** Cast each parameter to its expected data type *within the handler*.  For example: `$id = (int) $vars['id'];`. This is done *after* `fast-route` has matched the route.
    3.  **Range/Length Checks:** Implement checks for numeric and string parameters *within the handler*, based on your application's requirements.  Example: `if ($id < 1 || $id > 1000) { /* Handle invalid input */ }`.
    4.  **Whitelist Validation (if applicable):** If a parameter should only accept specific values, use a whitelist check *within the handler*. Example: `if (!in_array($parameter, $allowedValues)) { /* Handle invalid input */ }`.
    5.  **Sanitization:** Sanitize the input *within the handler*, based on its intended use (e.g., `htmlspecialchars()` for HTML output). This is crucial even after `fast-route`'s regex matching.
    6.  **Error Handling:** If validation/sanitization fails *within the handler*, return an appropriate HTTP error code (e.g., 400, 422) and a user-friendly message.
    7. **Validation Library (Optional):** Consider using a validation library *within the handler* for complex rules.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Severity: Variable):** Prevents unexpected values from reaching your application logic, even if they match the route's regex.
    *   **Parameter Tampering (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from manipulating parameter values to access unauthorized resources.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Length limits can help mitigate some DoS attacks.
    *   **Indirectly mitigates XSS and SQL Injection:** While *not* directly preventing these, proper validation and sanitization within the handler are *essential* steps in preventing them, in conjunction with other techniques (prepared statements, output escaping).  `fast-route` alone cannot prevent these.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Parameter Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **DoS:** Risk partially mitigated.
    *   **XSS/SQL Injection:** Indirectly contributes to risk reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Type casting in `app/Controllers/UserController.php` for the `id` parameter.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Range checks missing for `id` in `app/Controllers/UserController.php`.
    *   Length limits missing for string parameters.
    *   No dedicated validation library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [ReDoS Protection (Route Regex Design)](./mitigation_strategies/redos_protection__route_regex_design_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regex Review:** Carefully review all regular expressions used in your *route definitions* (e.g., in `routes.php`). This is a direct interaction with `fast-route`.
    2.  **Regex Simplification:** Rewrite any complex or potentially vulnerable regular expressions in your *route definitions* to be simpler and more specific. Avoid nested quantifiers and overlapping alternations. This is the core of ReDoS mitigation *within the context of `fast-route`*.
    3. **Input Length Limits (Post-Routing):** Enforce length limits on individual route parameters *within your handlers*, as described in the previous strategy. This is a *combined* strategy, leveraging both `fast-route`'s matching and your handler logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Severity: High):** Directly addresses ReDoS by improving the regexes used by `fast-route`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **ReDoS:** Risk significantly reduced by careful regex design.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Input length limits (post-routing) are partially implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough review and simplification of route regexes in `routes.php` is not done.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dispatcher Usage and Updates (of FastRoute)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dispatcher_usage_and_updates__of_fastroute_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dispatcher Choice:** Select the appropriate `fast-route` dispatcher (e.g., `GroupCountBased`) based on your needs. This is a direct configuration of `fast-route`.
    2.  **Testing (FastRoute Usage):** Write unit and integration tests that specifically test *your use of `fast-route`*.  Test valid and invalid routes, edge cases, and potentially malicious inputs *as they relate to your route definitions*.
    3.  **Updates:** Keep `fast-route` itself updated to the latest version using Composer. This ensures you have the latest security fixes *within the library*.
    4. **Dependency Audit:** Regularly run `composer audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in `fast-route` and its dependencies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unknown Vulnerabilities in Dispatcher Implementation (Severity: Low to Medium):** Staying updated and testing your usage reduce the risk.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Severity: Variable):** `composer audit` and updates help mitigate vulnerabilities in the library itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unknown Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** `GroupCountBased` dispatcher is used. Basic unit tests exist. `composer update` is run periodically.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive testing of `fast-route` usage is lacking.
    *   `composer audit` is not in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic Routes from User Input (in FastRoute Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic_routes_from_user_input__in_fastroute_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Route Generation:** Review your code to ensure you are *not* generating `fast-route` definitions dynamically based on untrusted user input.
    2.  **Refactor to Static Routes:** If found, refactor to use only static route definitions within your `routes.php` (or equivalent) file. This directly relates to how you *configure* `fast-route`.
    3.  **Constrained Alternatives (Avoid if Possible):** If user-configurable routing is unavoidable, use *extremely* constrained and validated methods, and ensure they do *not* allow arbitrary regex or code injection into your `fast-route` configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (Severity: Critical):** Eliminates the risk of injecting code into your routing logic.
    *   **ReDoS (Severity: High):** Prevents user-supplied regexes from causing ReDoS.
    *   **Unpredictable Behavior (Severity: High):** Avoids unexpected routing behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk eliminated.
    *   **ReDoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Unpredictable Behavior:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** The application does not use dynamic route generation.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling (of FastRoute Dispatch Results)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling__of_fastroute_dispatch_results_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Custom `NOT_FOUND` Handler:** Implement a custom handler *within your `fast-route` setup* for `FastRoute\Dispatcher::NOT_FOUND`. This handler should return a 404 and a user-friendly message, without revealing internal details.
    2.  **Custom `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` Handler:** Implement a custom handler *within your `fast-route` setup* for `FastRoute\Dispatcher::METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`. Return a 405, optionally include an `Allow` header, and provide a user-friendly message.
    3.  **Exception Handling (Around FastRoute Dispatch):** Wrap your `fast-route` dispatch call (e.g., `$dispatcher->dispatch(...)`) in a `try-catch` block to handle any exceptions thrown by `fast-route` itself. Log the exception securely and return a generic 500 error to the user.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low to Medium):** Prevents `fast-route` error details from being exposed to the user.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Custom `NOT_FOUND` and `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` handlers are implemented. A global exception handler is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:** The `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` handler does not include the `Allow` header.
