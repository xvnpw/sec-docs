# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a fast and efficient routing library for PHP applications.
*   Offer a simple and intuitive API for developers to define routes.
*   Maintain high performance and minimal overhead.
*   Ensure compatibility with various PHP versions and frameworks.
*   Provide good documentation and support for users.

Business Risks:

*   Vulnerabilities in the routing logic could lead to unauthorized access or denial-of-service attacks.
*   Performance bottlenecks could impact the overall application performance.
*   Lack of compatibility with popular frameworks could limit adoption.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could lead to developer frustration.
*   Bugs or errors in the library could disrupt application functionality.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular expression based route matching (implemented in `src/Dispatcher.php` and `src/RouteParser/Std.php`).
*   security control: Route parameter validation (partially implemented, type validation can be added by users).
*   security control: Tests covering different routing scenarios (present in the `test` directory).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library itself does not handle authentication or authorization. It is the responsibility of the application using the library to implement these security measures.
*   accepted risk: The library does not provide built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS or CSRF. It is assumed that the application using the library will handle these concerns.
*   accepted risk: The library does not perform any input sanitization. It is assumed that the application will sanitize user input before passing it to the router.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement stricter input validation for route parameters to prevent potential injection attacks.
*   security control: Provide options for users to define custom validation rules for route parameters.
*   security control: Add security-focused tests to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider adding support for route-specific middleware to allow developers to easily implement security checks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly handled by the library. The application using FastRoute is responsible for authentication.
*   Authorization: Not directly handled by the library. The application using FastRoute is responsible for authorization.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Route parameters should be validated against expected data types and formats.
    *   Regular expressions used for route matching should be carefully reviewed to prevent ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: Not applicable to the core functionality of the routing library.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Code Commit" --> Git["Git Repository"]
    Git -- "Webhook Trigger" --> CI_Server["CI Server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)"]
    CI_Server -- "Checkout Code" --> Workspace["Build Workspace"]

    Workspace -- "Composer Install" --> Dependencies["Dependencies (including FastRoute)"]
    Workspace -- "Build Docker Image" --> DockerImage["Docker Image"]
    DockerImage -- "Push Image" --> DockerRegistry["Docker Registry"]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the Git repository.
2.  A webhook triggers the CI server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
3.  The CI server checks out the code into a build workspace.
4.  Tests are executed (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).
5.  Dependencies are installed using Composer (including FastRoute).
6.  A Docker image is built, containing the application code and its dependencies.
7.  The Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code review before merging to the main branch.
*   security control: Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests) to identify bugs and vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency management using Composer to ensure that the correct versions of libraries are used.
*   security control: Static analysis security testing (SAST) can be integrated into the CI pipeline to scan for potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) can be used to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Container image scanning to identify vulnerabilities in the base image and installed packages.
*   security control: Secure configuration of the CI server and build environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   The primary business process is the routing of incoming HTTP requests to the correct application logic. Any disruption to this process would prevent the application from functioning correctly.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   FastRoute itself does not handle sensitive data directly. However, the application using FastRoute might handle sensitive data, such as:
    *   User authentication credentials (e.g., usernames, passwords, tokens). Sensitivity: High.
    *   Personal data (e.g., names, addresses, email addresses). Sensitivity: High.
    *   Financial data (e.g., credit card numbers, bank account details). Sensitivity: High.
    *   Application-specific data (e.g., internal data, proprietary information). Sensitivity: Varies depending on the application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific regulatory requirements or compliance standards that the application must adhere to (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS)?
*   What is the expected traffic volume and performance requirements for the application?
*   Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that should be followed?
*   What is the threat model for the application? What are the potential attackers and their motivations?
*   What level of logging and monitoring is required for the application?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a fast and reliable routing library. Security is important, but performance should not be significantly impacted.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The application using FastRoute is responsible for implementing most security controls, including authentication, authorization, and input validation.
*   DESIGN: The application will be deployed using a containerized approach (e.g., Docker). The CI/CD pipeline will include automated testing and security checks.
