## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using FastRoute (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_fastroute__critical_node_.md)

**1. Compromise Application Using FastRoute (CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Description:** The ultimate goal of the attacker is to successfully compromise the application utilizing the `fastroute` library. This can be achieved through various vulnerabilities within the routing mechanism.
* **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerabilities present and the application's security measures.
* **Impact:** Critical - Full application compromise, data breach, service disruption, etc.
* **Effort:** Varies significantly depending on the chosen attack vector and the application's defenses.
* **Skill Level:** Ranges from Medium to High depending on the complexity of the exploit.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Can range from Low to High depending on the attack method and monitoring in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Route Definition Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_route_definition_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**2. Exploit Route Definition Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH START):**

* **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities arising from how routes are defined within the application using `fastroute`. This involves manipulating or exploiting weaknesses in the route configuration.
* **Likelihood:** Medium to High, as developers can make mistakes in route definitions.
* **Impact:** Medium to High, potentially leading to unauthorized access or denial of service.
* **Effort:** Low to Medium, often requiring analysis of route configuration and testing.
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium, requiring understanding of web routing and basic security principles.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium, requiring careful analysis of route configurations and application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overlapping Route Definitions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/overlapping_route_definitions__critical_node_.md)

**3. Overlapping Route Definitions (CRITICAL NODE):**

* **Description:**  The application defines routes that overlap, leading to ambiguity in which handler should be executed for a given request. Attackers can exploit this to force the execution of a less secure or unintended handler.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Common developer oversight.
* **Impact:** Medium to High - Could bypass authentication or access controls.
* **Effort:** Low - Requires understanding of route definitions, easily testable.
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic understanding of web routing.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Might require careful log analysis or understanding of intended application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Force Execution of Unintended Handler (HIGH-RISK PATH END)](./attack_tree_paths/force_execution_of_unintended_handler__high-risk_path_end_.md)

**4. Force Execution of Unintended Handler (HIGH-RISK PATH END):**

* **Description:**  As a result of overlapping route definitions, the attacker successfully crafts a request that is routed to an unintended handler. This handler might have vulnerabilities or lack proper security checks, allowing for further exploitation.
* **Likelihood:** Dependent on the presence of overlapping routes and the attacker's ability to craft a matching request.
* **Impact:** Medium to High - Could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other unintended consequences depending on the vulnerability of the executed handler.
* **Effort:** Low to Medium - Requires understanding of route definitions and the application's request handling.
* **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Basic understanding of web routing and application logic.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Might require careful log analysis and understanding of the intended application flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Regular Expressions in Routes (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_regular_expressions_in_routes__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**5. Malicious Regular Expressions in Routes (HIGH-RISK PATH START):**

* **Description:** The application uses regular expressions in its route definitions, and these regex patterns are either overly complex or poorly constructed, making them vulnerable to exploitation.
* **Likelihood:** Medium-High - Poorly written regex is common.
* **Impact:** High - Primarily leading to Denial of Service.
* **Effort:** Low to Medium - Tools available to test for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
* **Skill Level:** Medium - Understanding of regular expression backtracking.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Spikes in CPU usage might be noticeable, but pinpointing the cause can be harder.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (ReDoS) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH END)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__redos___critical_node__high-risk_path_end_.md)

**6. Denial of Service (ReDoS) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH END):**

* **Description:** By crafting specific URLs that exploit the backtracking behavior of vulnerable regular expressions in route definitions, the attacker can cause the server to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
* **Likelihood:** Medium-High - Poorly written regex is common.
* **Impact:** High - Application unavailability.
* **Effort:** Low to Medium - Tools available to test for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
* **Skill Level:** Medium - Understanding of regular expression backtracking.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Spikes in CPU usage might be noticeable, but pinpointing the cause can be harder.
