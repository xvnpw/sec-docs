# Threat Model Analysis for nikic/fastroute

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Regular Expressions in Route Definitions](./threats/overly_permissive_regular_expressions_in_route_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft URLs that match unintended routes due to overly broad or unanchored regular expressions used in route definitions. This allows them to potentially access functionalities or resources they shouldn't have access to. For example, a route defined as `/user/{id}` without proper constraints on `{id}` could match URLs like `/user/delete` or `/user/admin`. The vulnerability lies in how `fastroute`'s `RouteParser` interprets and matches these regexes.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application functionalities or data. Potential for privilege escalation or unintended data manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `RouteParser` (specifically the regular expression parsing and matching logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use specific and anchored regular expressions for route parameters (e.g., `/user/{id:[0-9]+}`).
* Avoid using overly broad wildcard patterns if more specific patterns can be used.
* Thoroughly test route definitions with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones, to ensure they match only the intended URLs.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via Route Definitions](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__via_route_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft URLs that, when matched against complex or poorly constructed regular expressions in route definitions, cause `fastroute`'s regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. This is a classic ReDoS attack that directly impacts `fastroute`'s performance.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive CPU usage within the routing component. Service disruption for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** `RouteParser` (specifically the regular expression matching engine).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using overly complex or nested regular expressions in route definitions.
* Test route matching performance with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones designed to trigger ReDoS, specifically targeting the route parsing logic.
* Consider using simpler routing patterns or alternative routing strategies if complex regexes are unavoidable.
* Implement timeouts for request processing to mitigate the impact of long-running regex matching within `fastroute`.

## Threat: [Bypass of Security Middleware/Checks due to Incorrect Route Definitions](./threats/bypass_of_security_middlewarechecks_due_to_incorrect_route_definitions.md)

**Description:** If route definitions within `fastroute` are not carefully considered in relation to security middleware or access control mechanisms, an attacker might be able to craft URLs that match routes that bypass intended security checks. This is a direct consequence of how `fastroute`'s `Dispatcher` matches routes and dispatches requests.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities, as the request bypasses intended security measures due to incorrect routing.

**Affected Component:** `Dispatcher` (the process of matching routes and dispatching to handlers, potentially bypassing middleware if routes are not correctly defined).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that security middleware is configured to apply to all relevant routes defined in `fastroute`.
* Carefully define route patterns in `fastroute` to ensure they are correctly intercepted by security checks.
* Thoroughly test the interaction between `fastroute`'s routing and security middleware to confirm that all intended routes are protected.
