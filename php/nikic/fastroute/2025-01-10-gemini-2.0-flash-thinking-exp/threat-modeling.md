# Threat Model Analysis for nikic/fastroute

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that exploits overly complex or poorly written regular expressions used in route definitions. The regex engine spends an excessive amount of time trying to match the crafted URL, consuming significant CPU resources and potentially leading to application slowdown or complete denial of service.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, leading to service disruption for legitimate users. Server resources are exhausted, potentially impacting other applications on the same server.

**Affected Component:** `FastRoute\RouteParser\Std` and `FastRoute\Dispatcher\RegexBasedAbstract`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and test all regular expressions used in route definitions.
* Use simpler, more specific regex patterns where possible.
* Implement request timeouts at the web server or application level.
* Consider using static analysis tools to identify potentially problematic regular expressions.
* Monitor server resource usage (CPU) for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Route Overlapping and Ambiguity Exploitation](./threats/route_overlapping_and_ambiguity_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a URL that matches multiple defined routes due to overlapping or ambiguous route patterns. This can lead to the application executing an unintended handler, potentially bypassing security checks or accessing sensitive functionality intended for a different route.

**Impact:** Access to unauthorized resources or functionality, bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Affected Component:** `FastRoute\DataGenerator\*` and `FastRoute\Dispatcher\*`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Define routes with clear and distinct patterns to avoid any overlap.
* Understand and utilize FastRoute's route matching order.
* Thoroughly test all route definitions with various input URLs.
* Implement explicit checks and validations within route handlers.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the FastRoute Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_fastroute_library_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, FastRoute might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from minor issues to critical security flaws allowing for remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The entire `nikic/fastroute` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest versions of the FastRoute library.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases.
* Consider using static analysis tools and dependency checking tools.
* Follow secure coding practices in your application.
* Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
