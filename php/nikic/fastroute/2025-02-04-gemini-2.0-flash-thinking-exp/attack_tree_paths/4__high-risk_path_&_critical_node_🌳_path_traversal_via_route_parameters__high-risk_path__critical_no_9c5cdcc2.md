### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Path Traversal via Route Parameters

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Name: Path Traversal via Route Parameters

This attack vector targets vulnerabilities arising from the misuse of route parameters within application handlers. In the context of FastRoute, route parameters are dynamic segments of a URL path that are extracted and made available to the corresponding handler function.  While FastRoute itself provides a robust routing mechanism, it is the *application code* that processes these parameters that introduces the vulnerability.  Specifically, if handlers directly use these parameters to construct file paths or resource identifiers without proper validation, they become susceptible to path traversal attacks.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Description: Handler Vulnerability - Incorrect Route Parameter Usage

The core vulnerability lies in the **application handler's logic**.  Developers might mistakenly assume that route parameters are inherently safe or sanitized.  However, route parameters are ultimately user-controlled input (via the URL). If a handler directly concatenates a route parameter with a base directory or uses it to directly access files or resources, without validation, an attacker can manipulate this parameter to traverse the file system or access unintended resources.

**Example of Vulnerable Code (Conceptual PHP):**

```php
<?php
use FastRoute\RouteCollector;

$dispatcher = FastRoute\simpleDispatcher(function(RouteCollector $r) {
    $r->addRoute('GET', '/files/{filename}', 'fileHandler');
});

function fileHandler($vars) {
    $filename = $vars['filename']; // Route parameter 'filename'

    // VULNERABLE CODE - Directly using route parameter to construct file path
    $filepath = '/var/www/application/uploads/' . $filename;

    if (file_exists($filepath)) {
        echo file_get_contents($filepath);
    } else {
        echo "File not found.";
    }
}

// ... (rest of FastRoute dispatching logic) ...
?>
```

In this vulnerable example, the `fileHandler` directly uses the `filename` route parameter to construct the `$filepath`.  There is no validation or sanitization of `$filename`.

#### 4.3. Exploitation Method: üêû Manipulate Route Parameters to Access Files or Resources Outside Intended Scope [CRITICAL NODE - Handler Vulnerability]

This is the **critical node** in the attack path because it represents the actual exploitation of the vulnerability.  Attackers manipulate route parameters in the URL to include path traversal sequences, such as:

*   `../`:  Moves one directory level up.
*   `../../`: Moves two directory levels up, and so on.
*   Encoded variations: `%2e%2e%2f` (URL encoded `../`), `..%2f` (partially encoded).

By embedding these sequences within the route parameter, attackers can escape the intended directory and access files or directories outside of the application's intended scope.

**Exploitation Example using the vulnerable code above:**

An attacker could craft the following URL:

```
http://example.com/files/../../../../etc/passwd
```

In this case, the `filename` route parameter becomes `../../../../etc/passwd`.  The vulnerable `fileHandler` would then construct the following `$filepath`:

```
/var/www/application/uploads/../../../../etc/passwd
```

Due to path traversal, this resolves to:

```
/etc/passwd
```

If the web server process has read permissions to `/etc/passwd`, the attacker would successfully retrieve the contents of the system's password file, leading to a **Data Breach (Confidentiality Loss)**.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact:

*   **üèπ Read sensitive files [HIGH IMPACT] - Data Breach, Confidentiality loss:**
    *   **Configuration Files:** Accessing files like `.env`, `config.php`, database configuration files, which often contain sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys, etc.).
    *   **Application Source Code:**  Revealing application logic, algorithms, and potentially hardcoded secrets within the source code.
    *   **User Data:** Accessing files containing user information, personal details, or sensitive documents stored within the application's file system.
    *   **System Files:** In more severe cases (depending on server permissions and application context), attackers might be able to access system files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` (if permissions allow, which is less common but possible in misconfigured environments).

*   **üèπ Execute arbitrary code [HIGH IMPACT] - if file inclusion vulnerabilities are present in handlers based on route parameters:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** If the vulnerable handler not only reads files but also *includes* or *executes* them (e.g., using `include()`, `require()`, `eval()` with the file path derived from the route parameter), attackers can achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.
    *   **Exploitation Scenario (LFI to RCE):**
        1.  **Path Traversal to Log Files:**  Attackers might use path traversal to access web server log files (e.g., access logs, error logs).
        2.  **Log Poisoning:**  Attackers inject malicious PHP code into these log files by sending specially crafted requests that get logged.
        3.  **File Inclusion via Route Parameter:**  Attackers then use the path traversal vulnerability again, but this time to include the poisoned log file through the vulnerable handler.
        4.  **Code Execution:** When the poisoned log file is included and executed by the PHP interpreter, the attacker's malicious code runs on the server, leading to RCE.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies:

*   **Never directly use route parameters to construct file paths without strict validation and sanitization.**  This is the **most critical mitigation**.  Treat route parameters as untrusted user input.

*   **Use secure file handling practices.**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the web server process runs with the minimum necessary permissions. Limit file system access for the web server user.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate route parameters to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters or path traversal sequences.
    *   **Output Encoding:** If displaying file contents (though generally discouraged for security reasons), properly encode output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.
    *   **Secure File Storage:** Store sensitive files outside the web root if possible, making them inaccessible directly via web requests even if path traversal vulnerabilities exist.

*   **Implement input validation and sanitization for route parameters within handlers.**
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Define a whitelist of allowed characters, file extensions, or file names.  Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.  This is generally more secure than blacklisting.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Remove or encode potentially harmful characters or sequences from the route parameter.  However, sanitization alone can be complex and error-prone.
    *   **Canonicalization:**  Convert the path to its canonical (absolute and normalized) form to remove redundant path separators and resolve symbolic links. This can help in validation but should not be the sole mitigation.

*   **Use whitelisting for allowed file paths if dynamic file access is necessary.**
    *   Instead of directly using the route parameter to construct the file path, map the route parameter to a predefined set of allowed file paths or identifiers.
    *   **Example (Conceptual PHP - Secure):**

    ```php
    <?php
    use FastRoute\RouteCollector;

    $allowedFiles = [
        'document1' => '/var/www/application/documents/document1.pdf',
        'image1'    => '/var/www/application/images/image1.png',
        // ... more allowed files ...
    ];

    $dispatcher = FastRoute\simpleDispatcher(function(RouteCollector $r) {
        $r->addRoute('GET', '/files/{fileId}', 'secureFileHandler');
    });

    function secureFileHandler($vars) {
        $fileId = $vars['fileId']; // Route parameter 'fileId'

        if (array_key_exists($fileId, $allowedFiles)) {
            $filepath = $allowedFiles[$fileId]; // Whitelist lookup

            if (file_exists($filepath)) {
                echo file_get_contents($filepath);
            } else {
                echo "File not found."; // Handle file not found securely
            }
        } else {
            echo "Invalid file ID."; // Reject invalid file IDs
        }
    }

    // ... (rest of FastRoute dispatching logic) ...
    ?>
    ```
    In this secure example, the `fileId` route parameter is used as a key to look up the actual `$filepath` in the `$allowedFiles` whitelist.  This prevents direct path manipulation.

*   **Avoid dynamic file inclusion based on user input.**  If possible, refactor the application logic to avoid including files dynamically based on user-provided parameters.  Use alternative approaches like template engines or pre-defined logic to handle different content or functionalities.

*   **Apply the principle of least privilege to handlers.**  Handlers should only have access to the resources they absolutely need. Avoid giving handlers broad file system access.

#### 4.6. Risk Level:

*   **Likelihood: Medium (if handlers are poorly implemented).**
    *   **Justification:**  Path traversal vulnerabilities due to improper input handling are a common class of web application vulnerabilities.  Developers, especially when under pressure or lacking sufficient security awareness, can easily make mistakes in handler implementations, leading to this vulnerability.  The ease of overlooking proper validation contributes to a medium likelihood.

*   **Impact: High (Data Breach, RCE).**
    *   **Justification:** As detailed in the "Potential Impact" section, successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences, including the exposure of sensitive data (data breach) and the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server (RCE). Both of these impacts are considered high severity in most risk assessment frameworks.

*   **Effort: Low.**
    *   **Justification:** Exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities is generally considered low effort for attackers.  Numerous readily available tools and techniques exist to automate path traversal attacks.  Simple URL manipulation is often sufficient to exploit these vulnerabilities.

*   **Skill Level: Low.**
    *   **Justification:**  Basic understanding of web URLs, path traversal concepts (like `../`), and common web application vulnerabilities is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.  No advanced hacking skills or specialized tools are typically required for initial exploitation.

*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium (WAFs can detect common path traversal patterns).**
    *   **Justification:** Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can often detect common path traversal patterns in URLs and block malicious requests.  However, attackers can employ evasion techniques (e.g., encoding, obfuscation, using less common path traversal sequences) to bypass WAFs.  Furthermore, detection relies on the WAF being properly configured and up-to-date.  Log analysis and code reviews are also necessary for comprehensive detection. Therefore, while WAFs offer some protection, detection is not always trivial, making it medium difficulty.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Path Traversal via Route Parameters" attack path highlights a critical vulnerability stemming from insecure application handler implementations when using FastRoute.  While FastRoute itself is not vulnerable, the responsibility for secure handling of route parameters rests entirely with the developers.

By understanding the exploitation methods, potential impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities in their FastRoute-based applications.  Prioritizing secure coding practices, input validation, and the principle of least privilege within handler functions is paramount to building robust and secure web applications.  Regular security code reviews and penetration testing are also recommended to identify and remediate any potential vulnerabilities.
