## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) Prevention through Regex Review and Testing in Route Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__prevention_through_regex_review_and_testing_in_route_de_1be90db9.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Isolate Route Definitions:** Locate all files where `FastRoute` route definitions are declared (e.g., a dedicated `routes.php` file).
    2.  **Identify Regex Routes:** Within these files, specifically identify routes that utilize regular expressions in their path patterns when using `FastRoute`'s `addRoute` method with regex components.
    3.  **Regex Analysis and Testing:** For each regex used in `FastRoute` routes, perform detailed analysis and testing for ReDoS vulnerabilities. Use regex testing tools, especially those with ReDoS detection capabilities, to evaluate regex complexity and vulnerability to crafted inputs. Test with various inputs, including edge cases and potential attack strings, against the specific regex engine used by PHP (PCRE).
    4.  **Simplify or Replace Vulnerable Regexes:** If a regex in a `FastRoute` route is found to be vulnerable or overly complex, prioritize simplifying it. If simplification is not feasible, consider alternative routing approaches that avoid complex regexes or break down the logic into multiple simpler routes or application-level checks *after* routing.
    5.  **Document Regex Usage in FastRoute:**  Maintain documentation specifically for regexes used within `FastRoute` routes. Document the purpose of each regex, any complexity considerations, and the results of ReDoS testing performed. This documentation should be easily accessible for developers maintaining the routing configuration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) via Route Patterns:** Severity: High. Maliciously crafted URLs targeting routes with vulnerable regular expressions in `FastRoute` can cause excessive CPU usage during route matching, leading to denial of service.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **ReDoS Mitigation in FastRoute:** High. Directly addresses ReDoS risks stemming from regex usage within `FastRoute` route definitions, significantly reducing the attack surface.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
        *   Basic regex review is sometimes performed during development of new routes using regexes in `FastRoute`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematic and mandatory ReDoS testing for all regexes used in `FastRoute` routes.
        *   Automated ReDoS scanning integrated into the development workflow for route definition files.
        *   Dedicated documentation specifically for regex usage within `FastRoute` configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Favor Literal Paths and Simple Patterns in FastRoute Route Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/favor_literal_paths_and_simple_patterns_in_fastroute_route_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Default to Literal Routes:** When defining routes using `FastRoute`, prioritize using literal string paths whenever possible. For example, use `/api/users` instead of `/api/{resource}` if you intend to only handle requests for `/api/users` at that specific route.
    2.  **Minimize Regex Usage in FastRoute:**  Actively minimize the use of regular expressions in `FastRoute` route definitions. Only employ regexes when absolutely necessary to handle truly dynamic path segments where literal matching is insufficient.
    3.  **Choose Simple Regexes When Necessary:** If regexes are required in `FastRoute` routes, opt for the simplest and most efficient patterns possible. Avoid complex lookarounds, backreferences, or deeply nested quantifiers. For instance, use `[0-9]+` for numeric IDs instead of more complex patterns.
    4.  **Refactor Routes for Simplicity:** Review existing `FastRoute` route configurations and identify opportunities to refactor routes to replace regex-based patterns with literal paths or simpler, less computationally expensive regexes. This might involve creating more specific routes instead of relying on overly generic regex-based routes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) via Route Patterns:** Severity: Medium. Reducing the number and complexity of regexes in `FastRoute` route definitions lowers the overall risk of ReDoS attacks targeting the routing layer.
        *   **Route Definition Complexity and Maintainability:** Severity: Low. Simpler route definitions in `FastRoute` are easier to understand, maintain, and debug, reducing the likelihood of configuration errors and potential security misconfigurations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **ReDoS Mitigation in FastRoute:** Medium. While not eliminating ReDoS risk entirely, minimizing regex usage in `FastRoute` significantly reduces the attack surface and potential impact.
        *   **Route Definition Clarity:** High. Improves the readability and maintainability of `FastRoute` route configurations.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
        *   New routes are generally created with literal paths when feasible in `FastRoute` configurations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Proactive and systematic review of existing `FastRoute` routes to identify and simplify or replace complex regex patterns.
        *   Establish coding guidelines that explicitly encourage literal paths and simpler patterns for `FastRoute` route definitions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Management of FastRoute Route Definition Files](./mitigation_strategies/secure_management_of_fastroute_route_definition_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Access to Route Files:** Ensure that files containing `FastRoute` route definitions (e.g., `routes.php`) are stored in locations with restricted file system permissions. Prevent unauthorized users or processes from reading or modifying these files directly on the server.
    2.  **Version Control for Route Definitions:** Manage `FastRoute` route definition files under version control (e.g., Git). This allows for tracking changes, auditing modifications, and reverting to previous configurations if necessary. Route changes should follow a controlled deployment process.
    3.  **Static Deployment of Routes:** Deploy `FastRoute` route definitions as part of the application's static configuration during the build and deployment process. Avoid dynamic generation or modification of route definitions at runtime based on untrusted input, as this could introduce vulnerabilities into the `FastRoute` routing logic.
    4.  **Code Review for Route Changes:** Implement code review processes for any changes to `FastRoute` route definition files. Ensure that route modifications are reviewed by security-conscious developers to identify potential security implications or unintended route exposures before deployment.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Route Injection/Manipulation via File Tampering:** Severity: High. If route definition files used by `FastRoute` are compromised, attackers could inject malicious routes, alter existing routes, or disable critical routes, leading to application hijacking or denial of service.
        *   **Application Logic Tampering via Route Modification:** Severity: High. Unauthorized modification of `FastRoute` routes can fundamentally alter the application's behavior and routing logic, potentially bypassing security controls or exposing unintended functionalities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Route Integrity in FastRoute:** High. Secure management of route definition files protects the integrity of the `FastRoute` routing configuration and prevents unauthorized modifications.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
        *   Route definition files are stored in version control.
        *   Direct modification of route files on production servers is generally restricted.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal file system permission restrictions specifically for `FastRoute` route definition files on production servers.
        *   Mandatory code review process for all changes to `FastRoute` route configurations.
        *   Explicit security considerations included in the code review checklist for route modifications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage FastRoute's Route Caching Effectively](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_fastroute's_route_caching_effectively.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Route Caching in Production:** Ensure that `FastRoute`'s built-in route caching mechanism is enabled in production environments. This is crucial for performance as it avoids recompiling and re-parsing route definitions on every request.
    2.  **Choose Appropriate Cache Storage for FastRoute:** Select a suitable cache storage mechanism for `FastRoute`'s route cache. Options include in-memory array caching (for smaller applications or specific use cases), file-based caching (using `FastRoute\RouteCollector::setCacheFile`), or more robust caching solutions like Redis or Memcached if integrated with your application. The choice depends on application scale and performance requirements.
    3.  **Configure Cache Invalidation Strategy:** Implement a strategy to invalidate the `FastRoute` route cache whenever route definitions are updated or deployed. This ensures that the application always uses the latest route configuration. Cache invalidation might involve deleting the cache file or using a cache versioning mechanism.
    4.  **Monitor Cache Performance:** Monitor the performance of `FastRoute`'s route caching to ensure it is functioning correctly and providing the expected performance benefits. Check cache hit rates and measure routing performance with and without caching enabled to verify its effectiveness.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion due to Routing Overhead):** Low. While `FastRoute` is fast, repeated route parsing and matching can still consume resources, especially under heavy load. Route caching mitigates this by reducing routing overhead, indirectly contributing to DoS prevention.
        *   **Performance Degradation due to Routing:** Low. Inefficient routing can lead to slower response times. Route caching improves routing performance, enhancing overall application responsiveness.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Performance Improvement in FastRoute Routing:** High. Route caching significantly reduces the performance overhead of `FastRoute` routing, leading to faster request processing and improved application performance.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in development, needs production verification.
        *   Route caching is enabled in the application configuration using file-based caching for `FastRoute`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Verification and optimization of `FastRoute` route caching configuration specifically for the production environment.
        *   Formal documentation of the cache invalidation strategy for `FastRoute` routes.
        *   Performance monitoring and benchmarking of `FastRoute` route caching in production to ensure optimal configuration and effectiveness.
        *   Consideration of more scalable cache storage options for `FastRoute` if file-based caching becomes a bottleneck.
