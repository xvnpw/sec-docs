# Threat Model Analysis for bcosca/fatfree

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters (e.g., `/user/@id`) by injecting malicious code or unexpected values. This occurs if the application directly uses these parameters in database queries, file operations, or commands without proper sanitization or validation within the Fat-Free application logic. For example, injecting SQL code into a parameter used in a database query could lead to unauthorized data access or modification.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   Data Manipulation: Modification or deletion of data.
    *   Account Takeover: Compromising user accounts.
    *   Application Downtime: Causing application errors or crashes.
*   **Affected Fat-Free Component:** Routing, Input Handling, Database Interaction (when parameters are used in queries within F3 controllers/models)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all route parameters using appropriate functions (e.g., `filter_var` in PHP) based on the expected data type within your Fat-Free application.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate route parameters against expected formats and ranges within your Fat-Free application logic.
    *   **Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:** Use prepared statements or parameterized queries when interacting with databases from within your Fat-Free application to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Framework Input Filtering:** Utilize Fat-Free's input filtering mechanisms (e.g., `$f3->get('PARAMS.id', 'FILTER_VALIDATE_INT')`) where applicable in your controllers.

## Threat: [Template Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/template_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If user-supplied data is directly embedded into templates rendered by the Fat-Free Template Engine without proper escaping or sanitization, attackers can inject malicious template code. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server (if server-side template injection) or client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (if client-side template injection or reflected server-side injection leading to client-side execution). For example, injecting template directives into a user comment field that is then rendered using the Fat-Free template engine could allow execution of arbitrary PHP code or JavaScript.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (Server-Side): Complete compromise of the server.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Client-Side): Client-side attacks, session hijacking, defacement.
    *   Information Disclosure: Access to sensitive server-side data.
*   **Affected Fat-Free Component:** Template Engine (Fat-Free Template Engine), View Rendering (`\Template::instance()->render()`)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for Server-Side RCE), High (for XSS)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Always escape user-provided data before displaying it in templates using the Fat-Free template engine's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{@variable | esc }}` in F3 templates).
    *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** Use context-aware escaping based on where the data is being rendered (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL) within your Fat-Free templates.
    *   **Avoid Raw User Input in Templates:** Minimize or eliminate the direct embedding of raw user input into templates rendered by Fat-Free.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities arising from template injection.

## Threat: [Known Vulnerabilities in Fat-Free Framework](./threats/known_vulnerabilities_in_fat-free_framework.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, Fat-Free Framework itself might have undiscovered or publicly known vulnerabilities in its core code. Using outdated versions of the framework exposes the application to these known risks. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities in Fat-Free to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution: Exploitable vulnerabilities in Fat-Free could lead to remote code execution within the application.
    *   Data Breach: Vulnerabilities in Fat-Free could allow unauthorized data access.
    *   Denial of Service: Vulnerabilities in Fat-Free could be exploited to cause application downtime.
*   **Affected Fat-Free Component:** Framework Core, potentially various components depending on the specific vulnerability within Fat-Free.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update Fat-Free Framework to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and release notes for Fat-Free Framework to stay informed about potential security issues.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Periodically scan the application and its Fat-Free framework for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Fat-Free Plugins or Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_fat-free_plugins_or_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses third-party plugins or extensions specifically designed for Fat-Free Framework, these components might contain their own vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in these Fat-Free plugins to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution: Vulnerable Fat-Free plugins could introduce remote code execution vulnerabilities into the application.
    *   Data Breach: Fat-Free plugins could have vulnerabilities leading to data breaches within the application's context.
    *   Application Instability: Poorly written Fat-Free plugins could cause application instability or introduce security issues.
*   **Affected Fat-Free Component:** Plugins, Extensions, potentially various components depending on the plugin's functionality within the Fat-Free application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the plugin and its vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Carefully vet and select plugins from trusted sources specifically designed for Fat-Free Framework.
    *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep Fat-Free plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Reviews of Plugins:** Conduct security reviews of Fat-Free plugins if possible, especially for critical functionalities or plugins from less reputable sources.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Use only necessary Fat-Free plugins and avoid using plugins with known security issues or poor maintenance.
