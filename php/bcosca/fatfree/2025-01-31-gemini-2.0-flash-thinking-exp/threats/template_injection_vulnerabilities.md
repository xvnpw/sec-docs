### 4. Deep Analysis of Template Injection Vulnerabilities

#### 4.1. Introduction to Template Injection in Fat-Free

Template Injection vulnerabilities arise when user-controlled data is directly embedded into templates processed by a template engine without proper sanitization or escaping. In the context of Fat-Free, this occurs when data from user input (e.g., GET/POST parameters, database records influenced by users) is directly inserted into template files (`.html`, `.php`, etc.) and rendered using the Fat-Free Template Engine.

The Fat-Free Template Engine uses a simple and efficient syntax, allowing for dynamic content generation. However, this flexibility can be exploited if not handled securely.  If an attacker can inject malicious template directives into the data being rendered, they can manipulate the template engine to execute arbitrary code.

#### 4.2. Technical Deep Dive: How Template Injection Works in Fat-Free

The Fat-Free Template Engine processes templates by parsing special directives enclosed in double curly braces `{{ }}`. These directives can include:

*   **Variables:** `{{ @variable }}` - Displays the value of a variable.
*   **Filters:** `{{ @variable | filter }}` - Applies filters to modify variable output (e.g., `esc`, `upper`, `lower`).
*   **Conditional Statements:** `{{ if condition }} ... {{ endif }}` - Executes code blocks based on conditions.
*   **Loops:** `{{ repeat array, item }} ... {{ endrepeat }}` - Iterates over arrays.
*   **Include Statements:** `{{ include file }}` - Includes other template files.
*   **PHP Code Execution (Potentially):** While not directly intended for arbitrary PHP execution within templates, vulnerabilities can arise if user input is used in contexts where the template engine might interpret it as code or directives.

**Vulnerable Scenario Example (Server-Side):**

Imagine a simple Fat-Free application that displays user comments. The comment is retrieved from a database and directly rendered in a template:

**Controller (`controller.php`):**

```php
<?php
$f3 = \Base::instance();

$f3->route('GET /comment/@id', function($f3, $params) {
    $commentId = $params['id'];
    // Insecurely fetching comment from database (simplified for example)
    $comment = "This is a comment."; // Assume this comes from a database
    if ($commentId == 1) {
        $comment = $_GET['comment']; // INSECURE: Directly using user input
    }

    $f3->set('comment', $comment);
    echo \Template::instance()->render('comment.html');
});

$f3->run();
```

**Template (`comment.html`):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Comment</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>User Comment</h1>
    <p>Comment: {{ @comment }}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Exploitation:**

If an attacker sends a request like:

`http://example.com/comment/1?comment={{ phpinfo() }}`

The `$_GET['comment']` value `{{ phpinfo() }}` will be directly assigned to the `$comment` variable and then rendered in the template. The Fat-Free Template Engine, in its default configuration, might interpret `{{ phpinfo() }}` as a valid directive (or at least not properly escape it in a way that prevents execution in certain contexts, depending on the exact engine behavior and configuration). This could lead to the execution of the `phpinfo()` function on the server, demonstrating Server-Side Template Injection and potentially leading to Remote Code Execution.

**Vulnerable Scenario Example (Client-Side/XSS):**

If the template engine doesn't properly escape HTML entities and an attacker injects JavaScript code within template directives, it can lead to XSS.

**Template (`comment.html` - modified):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Comment</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>User Comment</h1>
    <p>Comment: {{ @comment }}</p>
    <div id="comment-display"></div>
    <script>
        document.getElementById('comment-display').innerHTML = '{{ @comment }}'; // Potentially vulnerable if @comment is not escaped for JS context
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Exploitation:**

If an attacker sends a request like:

`http://example.com/comment/1?comment=<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`

The `$_GET['comment']` value `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` will be rendered within the `<script>` block. If not properly escaped for JavaScript context, this could lead to the execution of the JavaScript `alert('XSS')` in the user's browser, demonstrating Client-Side Template Injection leading to XSS.

#### 4.3. Attack Vectors and Scenarios

Template Injection vulnerabilities can arise in various parts of a Fat-Free application where user input is incorporated into templates:

*   **User Comments/Posts:** As demonstrated in the examples above, comment sections, forum posts, or any area where users can submit text that is later displayed can be vulnerable.
*   **Profile Information:** User profile fields (names, descriptions, etc.) that are rendered in templates.
*   **Search Queries:** If search terms are displayed in the search results page template without proper escaping.
*   **Error Messages:** Dynamically generated error messages that include user-provided input.
*   **Configuration Settings:** In less common but critical scenarios, if application configuration settings (read from databases or files and influenced by users) are used in templates without sanitization.
*   **URL Parameters and Form Data:** Any data received via GET or POST requests that is directly used in template rendering.

#### 4.4. Impact Analysis (Detailed)

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Server-Side Template Injection (Critical):**
    *   **Complete Server Compromise:**  Successful SSTI can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This grants them full control over the web server and potentially the entire underlying system.
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data, including database credentials, application source code, and user data.
    *   **Malware Installation:**  Attackers can install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can crash the server or disrupt its services.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  From a compromised web server, attackers can potentially pivot to other systems within the network.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Client-Side Template Injection (High):**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Account Takeover:** By hijacking sessions or using other XSS techniques, attackers can take over user accounts.
    *   **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of the web page displayed to users, defacing the website.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware into the web page.
    *   **Information Theft (Client-Side):** Attackers can steal sensitive information from the user's browser, such as login credentials or personal data.

*   **Information Disclosure (Both Server-Side and Client-Side):**
    *   **Server-Side:** SSTI can be used to read server-side files, environment variables, and other sensitive information.
    *   **Client-Side:** CSTI/XSS can be used to access client-side data, such as cookies, local storage, and potentially sensitive information displayed on the page.

#### 4.5. Vulnerability Detection

Identifying Template Injection vulnerabilities requires a combination of techniques:

*   **Code Review:** Manually reviewing the application code, especially template files and controller logic, to identify instances where user input is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping. Look for patterns where variables derived from user input are used within `{{ }}` directives in templates.
*   **Static Analysis:** Using static analysis tools that can automatically scan code for potential Template Injection vulnerabilities. These tools can identify code patterns that are known to be risky.
*   **Dynamic Testing (Penetration Testing):**  Actively testing the application by injecting various template directives into user input fields and observing the application's response. This includes:
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Submitting a range of potentially malicious template directives to input fields and observing for errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Payload Crafting:**  Developing specific payloads designed to trigger code execution or XSS based on the expected template engine syntax.
    *   **Black-box Testing:** Testing the application without access to the source code, relying on input/output analysis.
    *   **White-box Testing:** Testing with access to the source code, allowing for more targeted and efficient vulnerability identification.

#### 4.6. Exploitation Examples (Fat-Free Specific)

**Server-Side RCE Example (Illustrative - may require specific Fat-Free configuration or vulnerabilities in filters if default escaping is robust):**

Assuming a vulnerable scenario where direct PHP code execution is possible (this is less likely in default F3 with proper escaping, but demonstrates the concept):

**Payload:** `{{ {{@_POST.cmd}} }}`  (or similar, depending on F3 template engine nuances)

**Request:** `POST /vulnerable-endpoint  cmd=system('whoami');`

This payload attempts to execute the `system('whoami')` command on the server.  In a real-world scenario, the exact payload might need to be adjusted based on the specific template engine behavior and any filters applied.

**Client-Side XSS Example (More likely if escaping is missed in JS context):**

**Payload:** `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

**Request:** `GET /vulnerable-endpoint?input=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

If this payload is rendered in a template without proper HTML escaping, the JavaScript `alert('XSS')` will execute in the user's browser.

**Information Disclosure Example (Server-Side):**

**Payload:** `{{ file_get_contents('/etc/passwd') }}` (Illustrative - might require specific function access or bypasses)

**Request:** `GET /vulnerable-endpoint?input={{ file_get_contents('/etc/passwd') }}`

This payload attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file on the server.  Again, the success depends on the template engine's capabilities and any security restrictions in place.

#### 4.7. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed Fat-Free Context)

*   **Output Encoding/Escaping (Mandatory):**
    *   **Use Fat-Free's `esc` Filter:**  The most crucial mitigation is to **always** use the `esc` filter when displaying user-provided data in templates. This filter escapes HTML entities, preventing XSS.

    **Secure Template Example:**

    ```html
    <p>Comment: {{ @comment | esc }}</p>
    ```

    *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** While `esc` is essential for HTML context, consider context-aware escaping for other contexts:
        *   **JavaScript Context:** If embedding data within `<script>` tags, use JavaScript-specific escaping functions (e.g., `json_encode` in PHP before passing to the template, or a custom filter if needed).
        *   **URL Context:** If embedding data in URLs, use URL encoding functions (e.g., `urlencode` in PHP).
        *   **CSS Context:** If embedding data in CSS, use CSS-specific escaping.

*   **Avoid Raw User Input in Templates (Best Practice):**
    *   **Process and Sanitize Input in Controllers:**  Ideally, process and sanitize user input in your Fat-Free controllers *before* passing it to the template engine. This might involve:
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validating user input against expected formats and data types.
        *   **Sanitization:**  Removing or modifying potentially harmful characters or code from user input.
        *   **Using Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:**  When dealing with database interactions, always use prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection, which can indirectly lead to Template Injection if database data is then used in templates without escaping.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Implement CSP Headers:**  Configure your web server to send CSP headers. CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, including those arising from Template Injection, by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).
    *   **Example CSP Header:** `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';` (This is a basic example and should be tailored to your application's needs.  `'unsafe-inline'` should be avoided if possible and replaced with nonces or hashes for inline scripts and styles in a more secure setup).

#### 4.8. Prevention Best Practices

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid granting excessive permissions to the web server process.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including Template Injection.
*   **Keep Fat-Free Framework and Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update the Fat-Free Framework and any third-party libraries to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Awareness Training for Developers:**  Educate developers about Template Injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
*   **Use a Robust Template Engine (Fat-Free's is generally safe with proper use):** While Fat-Free's template engine is generally secure when used correctly with escaping, understanding its security features and limitations is crucial.

#### 4.9. Conclusion

Template Injection vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to Fat-Free applications, potentially leading to critical consequences like Remote Code Execution and Cross-Site Scripting.  By understanding the mechanics of these vulnerabilities, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and following secure coding practices, development teams can effectively protect their Fat-Free applications from Template Injection attacks.  **The most critical mitigation is consistently and correctly using output encoding/escaping, especially the `esc` filter in Fat-Free templates, for all user-provided data.**  Combining this with other defense-in-depth measures like CSP and input sanitization provides a strong security posture against this threat.
