# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Fat-Free Framework (fatfree), is a lightweight yet powerful PHP web framework designed to help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently.

- Business Priorities:
  - Rapid Application Development: Fatfree aims to simplify and accelerate the web development process, allowing developers to bring applications to market faster.
  - Ease of Use: The framework is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, reducing the learning curve for new developers and increasing productivity.
  - Flexibility: Fatfree provides a flexible foundation that can be adapted to a wide range of web application types and complexities.
  - Performance: As a lightweight framework, performance is a key consideration, ensuring applications built with Fatfree are responsive and efficient.
- Business Goals:
  - Empower developers to create web applications with minimal overhead and maximum efficiency.
  - Provide a robust and reliable framework that can be used for both small and medium-sized projects.
  - Foster a community of developers around the framework, encouraging contributions and improvements.
- Business Risks:
  - Security Vulnerabilities: As a web framework, vulnerabilities in Fatfree could directly impact the security of applications built upon it. This is a critical risk, especially if the framework is widely adopted.
  - Lack of Updates and Maintenance: If the framework is not actively maintained and updated, it could become outdated and potentially insecure over time.
  - Compatibility Issues: Changes in PHP or related technologies could lead to compatibility issues if the framework is not kept up-to-date.
  - Adoption Rate: If the framework fails to gain sufficient adoption, its long-term viability and community support may be limited.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation is expected to be implemented by developers using the framework within their applications. (Implementation responsibility is on the application developer using the framework).
  - security control: Output encoding is expected to be implemented by developers using the framework within their applications. (Implementation responsibility is on the application developer using the framework).
  - security control: Secure coding practices are recommended for developers using the framework. (Documented in best practices and community guidelines, if available).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in applications built using Fatfree due to developer error. The framework provides tools, but ultimately application security depends on the developer's implementation.
  - accepted risk: Outdated dependencies in applications built using Fatfree if developers do not actively manage their application dependencies.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) for the Fatfree framework itself to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and patching security vulnerabilities in the framework.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using Fatfree to build secure applications.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate community security audits and contributions to enhance the framework's security posture.
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning for the framework's dependencies to ensure no known vulnerabilities are present in third-party libraries.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Applications built with Fatfree will likely require authentication mechanisms to verify user identities. The framework should provide tools or libraries to facilitate secure authentication implementation (e.g., session management, integration with authentication libraries).
  - Authorization:
    - Applications will need authorization mechanisms to control user access to resources and functionalities. The framework should offer features or guidance for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization models.
  - Input Validation:
    - Robust input validation is crucial to prevent injection attacks. The framework should encourage and simplify input validation at all application entry points. This includes providing tools for sanitizing and validating user inputs.
  - Cryptography:
    - Applications may need to handle sensitive data that requires encryption. The framework should support or integrate with cryptography libraries to enable secure data storage and transmission. This includes providing guidance on secure key management practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Serving web content and applications to users.
  - User authentication and authorization for accessing application features.
  - Data processing and storage within the application.
  - Maintaining application availability and performance.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Potentially sensitive user data (depending on the application built with Fatfree). This could include personal information, credentials, financial data, etc. The sensitivity level is highly application-dependent.
  - Application code and configuration, which are critical for application functionality and security.
  - Database credentials and API keys, which are highly sensitive and must be protected.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What type of applications are primarily being built with Fatfree? (e.g., e-commerce, blogs, APIs, internal tools). This would help refine the risk assessment and security requirements.
  - What is the expected scale and user base of applications built with Fatfree? (small, medium, large). This impacts scalability and performance considerations in the design.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that applications built with Fatfree need to adhere to? This would introduce specific security controls and requirements.
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding security vulnerabilities in web applications? (startup vs. Fortune 500). This influences the prioritization of security controls.
  - What existing security infrastructure and tools are already in place within the organization? (WAF, vulnerability scanners, SIEM). This helps to integrate Fatfree application security with existing security practices.

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is rapid and efficient web application development. Security is important but should not overly hinder development speed.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Developers using Fatfree are expected to take responsibility for application-level security. The framework provides tools and guidance, but the ultimate security posture depends on the application development practices.
  - DESIGN: Applications built with Fatfree will likely be deployed in cloud environments using containerization and orchestration technologies like Kubernetes. A typical three-tier architecture (web server, application runtime, database) is assumed. The build process is automated using CI/CD pipelines and includes basic security checks.
