**Attack Vector Name:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via malicious code injection into template variables.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Defacement.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on developer practices, but a common mistake when handling user input in templates.
*   **Effort:** Low - If the vulnerability exists, it is readily exploitable with standard web request manipulation.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of template engines, web requests, and basic exploitation techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Can be subtle and may require code review and dynamic analysis to identify.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strict input validation and sanitization for all data used in templates.
    *   Never directly embed unsanitized user input into templates.
    *   Use parameterized queries for database retrieval to prevent SQL Injection when data is used in templates.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of successful XSS/SSTI.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Fat-Free Framework Core - Database Abstraction Layer Vulnerabilities (Less direct, but potential for misuse) - Encouraging Insecure Database Practices (Indirect) - Lack of clear guidance on parameterized queries leading to SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_fat-free_framework_core_-_database_abstraction_layer_vulnerabilities___804254ac.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** SQL Injection due to lack of parameterized queries, potentially encouraged by insufficient guidance in framework documentation.
*   **Impact:** Critical - SQL Injection, Data Breach, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on database privileges and application logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High - A common developer mistake, especially among less experienced developers or when documentation doesn't strongly emphasize secure practices.

**Attack Vector Name:** Information Disclosure via Debug Output when Debug Mode is enabled in production.
*   **Impact:** Medium-High - Information leakage of sensitive configuration details, file paths, database credentials, and internal application workings. This information can significantly aid attackers in exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - A common misconfiguration, especially in quick deployments or when developers forget to disable debug mode before going live.
*   **Effort:** Low - Simply observing error messages in web responses.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic web browsing skills are sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Debug output is often directly visible in web responses and easily detected by automated scanners.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Always disable debug mode in production environments.**
    *   Implement proper error handling and logging.
    *   Sanitize error messages to prevent the exposure of sensitive details to users, even in development environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Misconfigurations of Fat-Free Framework - Insecure File Permissions - Access to Configuration Files - Read configuration files (.ini files) containing database credentials, API keys](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_misconfigurations_of_fat-free_framework_-_insecure_file_permissions_-_access_to_configura_608f8861.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Exposure of sensitive configuration files due to insecure file permissions.
*   **Impact:** High - Data breach and unauthorized access due to exposure of database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information stored in configuration files.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - A common server misconfiguration, especially if default server setups are not hardened.
*   **Effort:** Low - Simple file access if permissions are incorrectly set.
*   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic file system knowledge is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires internal file system checks and is less visible externally. Security audits and configuration reviews are needed.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Set secure file permissions to restrict access to configuration files to only necessary processes and users.
    *   Store sensitive configuration data outside the web root if possible.
    *   Prefer using environment variables for storing sensitive configuration data instead of files.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Dependencies - Vulnerabilities in PHP Version - Exploit known vulnerabilities in the PHP interpreter - Use publicly known exploits for the running PHP version](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_dependencies_-_vulnerabilities_in_php_version_-_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_the_php__49eb8e66.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the running PHP interpreter version.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), and various other security breaches depending on the specific PHP vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - PHP vulnerabilities are discovered periodically. Likelihood depends on how frequently the PHP version is updated and patched.
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium - Public exploits are often available for known PHP vulnerabilities, reducing the effort required for exploitation.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of exploit usage and basic system administration skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems can detect exploitation attempts. Regular vulnerability scanning is also helpful.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep the PHP version updated and apply security patches promptly.**
    *   Implement a robust patch management process.
    *   Monitor security advisories for PHP and subscribe to security mailing lists.

**Attack Vector Name:** Session Hijacking or Session Fixation due to insecure session management practices.
*   **Impact:** High - Account takeover and unauthorized access to user accounts and application functionality.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on session configuration and network security. Common if default session settings are used insecurely or if network traffic is not properly secured.
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium - Session hijacking tools and techniques are readily available. Session fixation attacks can also be relatively straightforward to execute.
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium - Requires basic understanding of session management, cookies, and network traffic.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard - Requires session monitoring, anomaly detection, and secure logging to detect session hijacking attempts. Session fixation can be harder to detect without specific testing.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Configure sessions securely:
        *   Use HTTP-only and Secure flags for session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access and transmission over insecure HTTP.
        *   Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation.
        *   Implement proper session timeouts to limit the window of opportunity for session hijacking.
        *   Consider using secure session storage mechanisms (e.g., database-backed sessions) and secure session cookie paths.
