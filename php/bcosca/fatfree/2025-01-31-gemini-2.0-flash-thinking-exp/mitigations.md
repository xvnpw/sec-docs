## Mitigation Strategy: [Route Parameter Validation within F3 Routes](./mitigation_strategies/route_parameter_validation_within_f3_routes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within your Fat-Free Framework application, specifically in route definitions (using `$f3->route()`, `$f3->get()`, `$f3->post()`, etc.), identify all route parameters defined using `@parameter_name` syntax.
    2.  In the corresponding route handler function, immediately access route parameters using `$f3->get('PARAMS.parameter_name')`.
    3.  Implement validation logic *directly within the route handler* for each accessed parameter. Utilize PHP's built-in validation functions or external libraries.
    4.  Leverage F3's routing capabilities to enforce basic parameter constraints directly in the route definition itself using regular expressions (e.g., `/user/@id:[0-9]+`). This provides an initial layer of validation *before* the route handler is even executed.
    5.  If validation fails within the handler, use F3's response methods (e.g., `$f3->error()`, `$f3->status()`) to send appropriate HTTP error responses back to the client.
    6.  Utilize F3's logging features (`\Log::instance()->write()`) to record validation failures, including the route, parameter name, and invalid value, for monitoring and debugging.
    7.  Sanitize validated route parameters *within the route handler* before further processing, especially before database queries or system commands.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code through route parameters used in database queries within F3 controllers.
    *   Command Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary system commands if route parameters are used in shell commands within F3 controllers.
    *   Path Traversal (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of attackers accessing unauthorized files or directories if route parameters are used to construct file paths within F3 applications.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Risk Reduction
    *   Command Injection: High Risk Reduction
    *   Path Traversal: Moderate Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic validation using regular expressions in route definitions is used for some routes, like user ID parameters.
    *   Sanitization using `filter_var()` is applied in *some* F3 controller actions handling route parameters.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation within F3 route handlers is missing for many route parameters, especially in API endpoints.
    *   Consistent validation logic is not applied across all F3 routes that accept parameters.
    *   F3's logging is not consistently used to record route parameter validation failures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Template Engine Output Encoding in F3](./mitigation_strategies/template_engine_output_encoding_in_f3.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When using F3's template engine (or a chosen alternative like Twig integrated with F3), ensure proper output encoding is applied to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    2.  Utilize the template engine's built-in escaping mechanisms. For F3's default template engine, this is often done automatically, but verify this is enabled and correctly configured.
    3.  Explicitly escape variables within F3 templates using the appropriate escaping functions provided by the template engine, especially when outputting user-generated content. For HTML context in F3's default engine, this is often handled by default, but for other contexts (JavaScript, URLs within templates), explicit escaping might be needed.
    4.  Be cautious when using "raw" output or disabling escaping in F3 templates. Only do so when absolutely necessary and after thorough security review. Clearly document and justify any instances of raw output.
    5.  Review all F3 templates to ensure output encoding is consistently applied and appropriate for the context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts that are executed in the user's browser when user-provided data is displayed through F3 templates without proper encoding.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   F3's default template engine is used, and basic HTML escaping is likely enabled by default.
    *   `htmlspecialchars()` is used in *some* F3 templates for specific variables.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Context-aware escaping within F3 templates might not be consistently applied for all output contexts (e.g., JavaScript, URLs within templates).
    *   Review is needed to confirm default escaping is enabled and effective in F3's template engine configuration.
    *   Documentation and review process for "raw" output usage in F3 templates is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries with F3 Database Abstraction](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_with_f3_database_abstraction.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When interacting with databases in your F3 application, *exclusively* use F3's database abstraction layer (e.g., F3's database mapper or direct database object usage).
    2.  Utilize the parameterized query features provided by F3's database layer. When using F3's database mapper, ensure you are using methods that inherently use parameterized queries (e.g., `find()`, `load()`, `update()`, `insert()`).
    3.  When using direct database object access in F3 (e.g., `$db->exec()`, `$db->query()`), *always* use placeholders (e.g., `?` or named parameters) and bind parameters using F3's database methods to prevent SQL injection.
    4.  Avoid constructing SQL queries by directly concatenating user inputs or route parameters within F3 controllers or data access logic.
    5.  Review all database interaction code within F3 controllers, models, and data access layers to ensure parameterized queries are consistently used through F3's database abstraction.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Completely prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities by ensuring all database interactions within the F3 application utilize parameterized queries through F3's database layer.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   F3's database mapper is used for many data access operations, which inherently uses parameterized queries.
    *   Parameterized queries are used in authentication modules that interact with the database via F3's database layer.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Manual SQL query construction might still exist in some parts of the application, especially in older code or custom database interactions outside of F3's mapper, potentially bypassing parameterized queries.
    *   A code review focused on database interactions within F3 controllers and models is needed to eliminate any instances of direct string concatenation for SQL query building.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Configuration via F3/PHP Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_configuration_via_f3php_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure PHP session settings that are used by Fat-Free Framework. This can be done in `php.ini`, `.htaccess`, or directly within your F3 application's bootstrap file using `ini_set()` *before* F3 session handling is initialized.
    2.  Set the following session security directives to enhance session security within your F3 application:
        *   `session.cookie_httponly = 1`: To prevent JavaScript access to session cookies, mitigating XSS-based session hijacking in F3 applications.
        *   `session.cookie_secure = 1`: To ensure session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks when using F3 applications over HTTPS.
        *   `session.cookie_samesite = "Strict"` or `"Lax"`: To help prevent CSRF attacks by controlling when session cookies are sent with cross-site requests in F3 applications.
        *   `session.use_strict_mode = 1`: To prevent session fixation attacks by regenerating session IDs on each request within F3 applications.
    3.  Consider using a secure session storage mechanism for F3 applications instead of the default file-based storage. This can be configured within PHP settings or potentially by extending F3's session handling if custom storage is needed.
    4.  Regularly review session configuration to ensure it remains secure and aligned with best practices for F3 applications.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session Hijacking (High Severity) - `httponly` and `secure` flags significantly reduce the risk of session cookies being stolen in F3 applications.
    *   Session Fixation (Medium Severity) - `use_strict_mode` prevents attackers from pre-setting session IDs in F3 applications.
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity) - `samesite` attribute provides some level of CSRF protection for F3 applications.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Hijacking: High Risk Reduction
    *   Session Fixation: Moderate Risk Reduction
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Moderate Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `session.cookie_httponly = 1` and `session.cookie_secure = 1` are set in the `php.ini` configuration affecting the F3 application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `session.cookie_samesite` attribute is not explicitly set for F3 application sessions.
    *   `session.use_strict_mode` is not enabled for F3 application sessions.
    *   More secure session storage options beyond default files are not explored for the F3 application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection Implementation in F3](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection_implementation_in_f3.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection for all state-changing operations within your Fat-Free Framework application.
    2.  Utilize F3's session handling to store and manage CSRF tokens. Generate a unique, unpredictable CSRF token per user session and store it in the F3 session.
    3.  Create an F3 middleware or a base controller that automatically generates and embeds CSRF tokens into forms rendered by F3 templates.
    4.  For AJAX requests, ensure the CSRF token is included as a header or in the request body.
    5.  Implement validation logic within F3 middleware or controller actions to check the CSRF token on every state-changing request. Compare the received token with the token stored in the F3 session.
    6.  If the CSRF token is invalid or missing, use F3's response methods to reject the request and return an appropriate error (e.g., 403 Forbidden) within the F3 application flow.
    7.  Consider using existing PHP CSRF protection libraries and integrate them into your F3 application using middleware or service providers.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from performing unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user within the F3 application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic CSRF protection is implemented for main forms using a custom function, but it's not consistently applied across the entire F3 application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent CSRF protection using F3 middleware or a base controller is missing for all forms and state-changing API endpoints in the F3 application.
    *   CSRF protection is not implemented for administrative panels or less common forms within the F3 application.
    *   Integration with existing CSRF protection libraries for PHP within the F3 framework is not explored.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Handling in F3](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_handling_in_f3.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure Fat-Free Framework's error handling to use custom error pages instead of default error displays. This is done by defining custom error handlers within your F3 bootstrap or configuration.
    2.  Create user-friendly error pages specifically for your F3 application that do not reveal sensitive information.
    3.  Disable detailed error reporting and debugging output in the production environment of your F3 application. Ensure PHP's `display_errors` is set to `Off`.
    4.  Utilize F3's logging capabilities (`\Log::instance()->write()`) to log detailed error information (including stack traces) to server-side logs for debugging and monitoring, but ensure this logging is separate from user-facing error pages in your F3 application.
    5.  Test custom error pages within your F3 application to ensure they are displayed correctly and do not leak sensitive information.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - Prevents attackers from gaining insights into the F3 application's architecture or vulnerabilities through detailed error messages displayed by default.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Moderate Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A custom 404 error page is implemented within the F3 application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Custom error pages are not implemented for other HTTP error codes (e.g., 500, 503) in the F3 application.
    *   Detailed error reporting might not be fully disabled in the production configuration of the F3 application.
    *   Consistent error logging using F3's logging features is not implemented for all error types within the F3 application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Fat-Free Framework Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_fat-free_framework_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly checking for updates to the Fat-Free Framework itself and any F3 plugins or extensions used in your application.
    2.  Monitor F3's official website, GitHub repository, and community channels for release announcements and security advisories related to Fat-Free Framework.
    3.  Apply updates to Fat-Free Framework and its components promptly after they are released, especially when security patches are included.
    4.  After each update, thoroughly test your F3 application to ensure compatibility and that no regressions are introduced due to the framework update.
    5.  Use a version control system (like Git) to manage your F3 application's codebase, including the Fat-Free Framework files, to facilitate easier updates and rollbacks if necessary.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities present in outdated versions of Fat-Free Framework or its dependencies within your application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The development team is generally aware of the need for updates but lacks a formal process for regularly checking and applying F3 updates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No scheduled process exists for checking and applying updates specifically for Fat-Free Framework.
    *   No automated dependency scanning or vulnerability monitoring is in place to track F3 vulnerabilities.
    *   Formal testing procedures after F3 updates are not defined or consistently followed.
