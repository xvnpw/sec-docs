## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities -> Route Injection -> Manipulate Input to Define New Routes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities_-_route_injection_-_manipulate_input_to_define_new_routes.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates input that is used to dynamically define application routes. This could involve exploiting a feature where routes are registered based on user-provided data without proper validation.
*   **Critical Node: Manipulate Input to Define New Routes:** Successfully injecting malicious route definitions allows the attacker to register routes that point to their own code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server when those routes are accessed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) -> Inject Malicious Code within Template Directives](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities_-_server-side_template_injection__ssti__-_inject_malicious_c_9d95920a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses a template engine (likely the default PHP templating in F3) and incorporates user-provided input directly into template directives without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code within Template Directives:** By injecting malicious code snippets within the template syntax, the attacker can force the template engine to execute arbitrary code on the server during the rendering process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Interaction Flaws -> SQL Injection via F3 Database Layer -> Inject Malicious SQL through F3's Query Building](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_interaction_flaws_-_sql_injection_via_f3_database_layer_-_inject_malicious_sql_thro_dc5e63b6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers use F3's database interaction features but fail to properly sanitize user input when constructing database queries. This can occur when using string concatenation or inadequate escaping instead of parameterized queries.
*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious SQL through F3's Query Building:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within the parameters intended for the database layer, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or even code execution via database features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Interaction Flaws -> SQL Injection via Raw Query Execution -> Inject Malicious SQL through Raw Query Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_interaction_flaws_-_sql_injection_via_raw_query_execution_-_inject_malicious_sql_th_46fde392.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers bypass F3's query builder and use raw SQL queries with unsanitized user input. This is a direct and often easily exploitable path for SQL injection.
*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious SQL through Raw Query Execution:** Similar to the previous SQL injection vector, the attacker injects malicious SQL directly into the raw query, gaining control over database operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses -> Configuration File Exposure -> Access Configuration Files due to Misconfiguration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_-_configuration_file_exposure_-_access_configuration_files_due_to_m_3cd8deeb.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Configuration files containing sensitive information (like database credentials, API keys) are accessible due to misconfiguration of the web server or application. This could be due to files being placed in the web root or incorrect access permissions.
*   **Critical Node: Access Configuration Files due to Misconfiguration:** Successfully accessing these files exposes sensitive information that can be used for further attacks, such as directly accessing the database or other services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses -> Insecure Configuration Settings -> Exploit Insecure Database Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_-_insecure_configuration_settings_-_exploit_insecure_database_crede_39c4ecba.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application uses default, weak, or easily guessable database credentials.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Database Credentials:**  Attackers can directly access the database using these weak credentials, leading to data breaches and potential further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses -> Insecure Session Management Configuration -> Exploit Weak Session Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_-_insecure_session_management_configuration_-_exploit_weak_session__0120f9c1.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application's session management is not configured securely. This could involve using predictable session IDs, not setting the `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags, or not regenerating session IDs after login.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Weak Session Handling:** Attackers can hijack or fixate user sessions, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts and their associated data and privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Behavior/Missing Security Features -> Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation by Default -> Inject Malicious Payloads due to Missing Default Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_behaviormissing_security_features_-_lack_of_input_sanitizationvalidation_by_default__412375f6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Fat-Free Framework, being a micro-framework, doesn't enforce strict input sanitization by default. If developers don't implement explicit sanitization, the application becomes vulnerable to various injection attacks, most commonly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Payloads due to Missing Default Sanitization:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application's output, which are then executed in other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement. While the immediate impact is often categorized as medium, it's a highly likely entry point for attackers.
