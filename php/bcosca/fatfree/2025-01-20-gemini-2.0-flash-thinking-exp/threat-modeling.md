# Threat Model Analysis for bcosca/fatfree

## Threat: [Insecure Route Definition Exploitation](./threats/insecure_route_definition_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Route Definition Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might craft specific URLs that were not intended to be publicly accessible due to overly permissive or poorly defined route configurations within the Fat-Free Framework. They could directly access internal application logic or resources by manipulating the URL structure as defined by F3's routing mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, execution of unintended application functionality, bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Routing Module (`$f3->route()`, `$f3->map()`, `$f3->config()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define explicit and specific routes for all intended public endpoints using F3's routing functions.
        *   Avoid using overly broad wildcard routes in F3's route definitions.
        *   Regularly review and audit route configurations defined within the F3 application.
        *   Implement access controls within controller methods to further restrict access, complementing F3's routing.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into templates if user-controlled data is directly embedded without proper escaping within Fat-Free Framework's template rendering process. The framework's template engine would then execute this code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server, access sensitive files, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Base Template Engine (`$f3->set('...', ...)`, `$f3->render()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates using F3's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{ @variable | esc }}`).
        *   Avoid directly concatenating user input into template strings within F3 templates.
        *   Consider using a more secure templating engine if the default one is deemed insufficient for the application's security needs.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Direct Query Construction](./threats/sql_injection_via_direct_query_construction.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Direct Query Construction
    *   **Description:** While Fat-Free Framework offers features to prevent SQL injection, developers might still construct raw SQL queries using user-provided data without proper sanitization when directly interacting with the database through F3's database abstraction layer.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to database resources, potentially leading to complete database compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database Abstraction Layer (`$db->exec()`, `$db->query()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries or F3's ORM features (if applicable) for database interactions.
        *   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user input when using F3's database functions.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization before using data in database queries executed through F3.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Database Credentials in Configuration
    *   **Description:** Database credentials stored insecurely in configuration files that are used by the Fat-Free Framework (e.g., plain text, publicly accessible) can be discovered by attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Handling (`$f3->config()`, configuration files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store database credentials securely, preferably using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system, rather than directly in F3 configuration files.
        *   Ensure configuration files used by F3 are not publicly accessible through web server configurations.
        *   Avoid committing sensitive configuration files to version control systems.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unescaped_output.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Output
    *   **Description:** If user-provided data is outputted in HTML without proper escaping within Fat-Free Framework's template rendering, attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious websites, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Base Template Engine, Output Handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data before displaying it in HTML using F3's built-in escaping functions within templates (e.g., `{{ @variable | esc }}`).
        *   Use context-aware escaping based on where the data is being outputted (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) within F3 templates.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks in conjunction with secure templating practices in F3.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** Configuration files used by the Fat-Free Framework might contain sensitive information like API keys, secret keys, or other credentials. If these files are accessible, attackers can gain access to this information.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, potential account compromise, or the ability to further compromise the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system, rather than directly in F3 configuration files.
        *   Ensure configuration files used by F3 are not publicly accessible through web server configurations.
        *   Restrict access to configuration files on the server.
