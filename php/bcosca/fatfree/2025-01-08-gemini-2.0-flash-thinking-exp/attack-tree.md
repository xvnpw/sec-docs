## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection Path](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Routing Vulnerabilities -> Route Parameter Injection -> SQL Injection via Fat-Free's DB Abstraction [CRITICAL]
*   **Description:** An attacker first identifies a route in the application where user-supplied input from the URL is used to construct a database query. By crafting malicious input within the route parameters, the attacker injects arbitrary SQL code. This injected SQL is then executed by the database due to the lack of proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries in the Fat-Free application's database interaction logic. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection Path](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Templating Engine Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL]
*   **Description:** The attacker targets the application's templating engine. If user-provided data is directly embedded into template variables without proper escaping, or if the templating engine itself has vulnerabilities, the attacker can inject malicious template code or directives. When the template is rendered by the server, this injected code is executed, potentially allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Inclusion Path](./attack_tree_paths/file_inclusion_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Request Handling Issues -> File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (If relying on Fat-Free's include mechanisms without proper checks) [CRITICAL]
*   **Description:** The attacker exploits how the Fat-Free application handles file inclusions. If the application uses user-controlled input to determine which files to include (e.g., using `include` or `require` statements), and this input is not properly validated or sanitized, the attacker can manipulate the input to include arbitrary files. This could involve including local files containing sensitive information or even remote files, potentially leading to code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities Path](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Fat-Free Framework Itself -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Fat-Free Version
*   **Description:** The attacker identifies the specific version of the Fat-Free framework being used by the application. They then search for known security vulnerabilities associated with that particular version. If such vulnerabilities exist and the application hasn't been patched, the attacker can leverage publicly available exploits or develop their own to compromise the application. The impact of this attack depends on the nature of the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Directly injecting malicious code into template variables that are not properly escaped.
*   **Description:** As described in the SSTI Path, this vulnerability allows for direct code execution on the server by manipulating the templating engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Fat-Free's DB Abstraction [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_fat-free's_db_abstraction__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries due to improper input handling.
*   **Description:** As described in the SQL Injection Path, this vulnerability grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to potential data breaches and manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (If relying on Fat-Free's include mechanisms without proper checks) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/file_inclusion_vulnerabilities__if_relying_on_fat-free's_include_mechanisms_without_proper_checks____ef3ca178.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating user-controlled input to include arbitrary files.
*   **Description:** As described in the File Inclusion Path, this vulnerability can lead to code execution by including malicious local or remote files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Debug Mode in Production [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_debug_mode_in_production__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the application in a production environment where debug mode is enabled.
*   **Description:**  When debug mode is enabled in a production environment, the application often reveals sensitive information such as error messages, file paths, and internal configurations. This information, while not directly leading to code execution or data breach, significantly aids attackers in understanding the application's structure and identifying other vulnerabilities, thus lowering the barrier for more complex attacks.
