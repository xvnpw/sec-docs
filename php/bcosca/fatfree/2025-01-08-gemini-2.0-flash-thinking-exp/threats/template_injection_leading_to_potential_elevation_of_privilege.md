        print("\n### Understanding the Threat in the Context of Fat-Free Framework (F3):\n")
        print("Fat-Free Framework utilizes a template engine, primarily accessed through the `F3::render()` method. This method processes template files, replacing variables and executing template logic. The core vulnerability arises when untrusted data (e.g., user input, database content) is directly embedded into template files without proper sanitization or escaping. If this untrusted data contains valid template syntax or even server-side scripting code, the template engine will execute it.")

        print("\n**How Template Injection Works in F3:**")
        print("- The `F3::render()` method takes a template file path as input.")
        print("- It parses the template, looking for specific syntax (e.g., `{{ @variable }}`).")
        print("- If user-controlled input is directly placed within these directives without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious code.")
        print("- This injected code can potentially execute PHP functions or manipulate application logic within the template context.")

        print("\n**The 'Elevation of Privilege' Aspect:**")
        print("The severity of this threat is amplified if the web server process or the PHP-FPM process running the application has elevated privileges (e.g., running as root or a user with sudo capabilities). In such a scenario, a successful template injection could allow the attacker to execute commands with those elevated privileges, leading to a complete system takeover.")

        print("\n### Potential Attack Scenarios:\n")
        print("- **User Input in Templates:**  Directly embedding user-provided data (e.g., from GET/POST requests) into templates without sanitization. Example: `<h1>Hello, {{ $_GET['name'] }}!</h1>` if not properly handled.")
        print("- **Database Content in Templates:** If data retrieved from the database is directly used in templates without proper escaping, and this data can be influenced by attackers (e.g., through SQL injection vulnerabilities elsewhere).")
        print("- **External API Responses in Templates:** If data fetched from external APIs is used in templates without sanitization, and the attacker can manipulate the API response.")

        print("\n### Detailed Impact Analysis:\n")
        print("- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web server process.")
        print("- **Complete System Compromise:** If the application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the server.")
        print("- **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive application data, user data, and potentially other data stored on the server.")
        print("- **Service Disruption:** The attacker can cause denial-of-service (DoS) by manipulating application logic or resources.")
        print("- **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.")

        print("\n### Deep Dive into Mitigation Strategies:\n")
        print("**1. Strictly Sanitize All User Input Used in Templates:**")
        print("   - **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode all dynamic data before it is rendered in the template. Use appropriate escaping functions based on the context (HTML escaping, URL encoding, JavaScript escaping, etc.). F3 provides mechanisms for this. For example, using `{{ @variable | esc }}` for HTML escaping.")
        print("   - **Context-Aware Escaping:** Choose the correct escaping method based on where the data is being used within the template (e.g., within HTML tags, attributes, or JavaScript).")
        print("   - **Avoid Direct Inclusion of Unsanitized Input:** Never directly embed raw user input into template variables without processing.")

        print("\n**2. Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege:**")
        print("   - **Run the Application with Minimum Necessary Permissions:** The web server process and PHP-FPM process should run with the absolute minimum privileges required for the application to function correctly. Avoid running these processes as root.")
        print("   - **Separate Processes:** Consider separating the template rendering process from the main application logic, especially if the main application requires elevated privileges. This can be achieved using techniques like sandboxing or containerization.")

        print("\n**3. Isolate Template Rendering Processes (If Possible):**")
        print("   - **Sandboxing:**  Utilize sandboxing techniques to restrict the capabilities of the template rendering process. This can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if template injection is successful.")
        print("   - **Containerization:** Run the application and its components within containers (e.g., Docker). This provides a degree of isolation and can limit the impact of a compromise.")

        print("\n### Additional Mitigation Recommendations:\n")
        print("- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load. This can help mitigate the impact of certain types of template injection attacks.")
        print("- **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential template injection vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses.")
        print("- **Secure Coding Practices:**")
        print("    - **Input Validation:** Validate all user input at the application level to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters.")
        print("    - **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection, which could indirectly lead to template injection.")
        print("    - **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:** Minimize the use of dynamic code execution functions (e.g., `eval()`, `create_function()`) within the application.")
        print("- **Keep Fat-Free Framework Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the Fat-Free Framework to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.")
        print("- **Educate Developers:** Train developers on secure coding practices and the risks of template injection.")

        print("\n### Detection Strategies:\n")
        print("- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to automatically analyze the application's source code for potential template injection vulnerabilities.")
        print("- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks on the running application and identify vulnerabilities.")
        print("- **Manual Code Review:** Conduct thorough manual code reviews, paying close attention to how user input is handled and how templates are rendered.")
        print("- **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit template injection vulnerabilities.")
        print("- **Security Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity that might indicate a template injection attack.")

        print("\n### Conclusion:\n")
        print(f"The threat of **{self.threat_name}** is critical due to the potential for complete server compromise, especially when the application operates with elevated privileges. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, focusing on strict input sanitization, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and employing robust detection mechanisms, is crucial for protecting the application. The development team should prioritize addressing this vulnerability and adopt secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle.")
