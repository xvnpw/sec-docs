# Threat Model Analysis for bcosca/fatfree

## Threat: [Template Injection leading to Spoofing](./threats/template_injection_leading_to_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into FFF templates by exploiting insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data passed to the template engine. This allows them to manipulate the displayed content, potentially impersonating legitimate parts of the application or displaying misleading information.
*   **Impact:** Users might be tricked into providing sensitive information or taking actions based on the spoofed content, leading to phishing attacks, reputational damage, or loss of trust.
*   **Affected Component:** Template Engine (`F3::render()`, template files)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize user input before rendering it in templates using FFF's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{ variable | esc }}`).
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating some injection attacks.
    *   Avoid directly embedding user-controlled data into template code without proper escaping.

## Threat: [Template Injection leading to Data Tampering](./threats/template_injection_leading_to_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to spoofing, attackers can inject malicious code into templates to alter the data displayed to users. This could involve changing prices, modifying displayed quantities, or altering other critical information.
*   **Impact:** Displaying incorrect or manipulated data can lead to financial losses, incorrect decision-making by users, and damage to the application's integrity.
*   **Affected Component:** Template Engine (`F3::render()`, template files)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly sanitize all user input that is rendered in templates.
    *   Implement robust input validation on the server-side before passing data to the template engine.
    *   Use output encoding appropriate for the context (e.g., HTML escaping for web pages).

## Threat: [Template Injection leading to Information Disclosure](./threats/template_injection_leading_to_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** By injecting specific template directives or code, attackers might be able to access server-side variables or application data that is not intended for public display.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information such as configuration details, internal application logic, or even data from the database if not properly handled.
*   **Affected Component:** Template Engine (`F3::render()`, template files)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize all user input used in templates.
    *   Avoid passing sensitive data directly to the template engine if it's not meant to be displayed.
    *   Consider using a template engine that offers robust security features and sandboxing capabilities.

## Threat: [Template Injection leading to Potential Elevation of Privilege](./threats/template_injection_leading_to_potential_elevation_of_privilege.md)

*   **Description:** In very specific and less common scenarios, if the application logic and template rendering are tightly coupled and the application runs with elevated privileges, successful template injection could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server and application, allowing the attacker to perform any action the application user has permissions for.
*   **Affected Component:** Template Engine (`F3::render()`, template files)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly sanitize all user input used in templates.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   Isolate template rendering processes if possible.

## Threat: [Manipulation of FFF Configuration](./threats/manipulation_of_fff_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** If FFF configuration files (e.g., `.ini` files) are accessible or can be manipulated due to vulnerabilities (e.g., path traversal), attackers could alter critical application settings.
*   **Impact:** Changes to database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive settings can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or complete application takeover.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading (`F3::config()`, `.ini` files)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store configuration files outside the web root and restrict access permissions.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use environment variables or secure vault solutions.
    *   Implement regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities that could lead to configuration file access.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through FFF Debug Mode](./threats/information_leakage_through_fff_debug_mode.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving FFF's debug mode enabled in a production environment exposes detailed debugging information, including database queries, application variables, and more.
*   **Impact:** Significant information disclosure that can be leveraged by attackers to understand the application's inner workings and identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Debug settings (`DEBUG` constant)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolutely ensure debug mode is disabled in production environments.** This is a critical security practice.

## Threat: [Path Traversal through FFF's File Serving Features](./threats/path_traversal_through_fff's_file_serving_features.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses FFF's features to serve static files or user-uploaded content, improper handling of file paths could allow attackers to access files outside the intended directories.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, including configuration files, source code, or other user data.
*   **Affected Component:** File serving features (`F3::serve()`, related functions)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully validate and sanitize file paths when using FFF to serve files.
    *   Restrict access to sensitive directories using operating system permissions.
    *   Consider using a dedicated web server (like Apache or Nginx) to serve static files, as they often have more robust security features for this purpose.
