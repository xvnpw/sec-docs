# Threat Model Analysis for bcosca/fatfree

## Threat: [Hive Variable Tampering](./threats/hive_variable_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Hive Variable Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into F3's hive (global variable storage) through unvalidated input *that is then used unsafely by F3 itself or a core F3 component*. This is distinct from general input validation issues; it's about F3 *relying* on the hive for security-critical operations without internal validation. This is a *direct* threat because the hive is a core F3 feature.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, application instability, *potential code execution* (if the tampered variable is used in an unsafe way *by F3*).
    *   **Affected F3 Component:**  The F3 hive (`$f3->set()`, `$f3->get()`, and related functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   While developers *should* validate all input, F3 itself could implement internal checks before using hive variables in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., before using a hive variable to determine authorization). This is a mitigation that could be applied *within F3*.
        *   F3 could provide more explicit guidance in its documentation about the security implications of using the hive and recommend alternative storage mechanisms for sensitive data.

## Threat: [AUTOLOAD Path Manipulation](./threats/autoload_path_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:**  `AUTOLOAD` Path Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the `AUTOLOAD` configuration to include malicious files. This is a *direct* threat because `AUTOLOAD` is a core F3 feature for class loading. The vulnerability exists if F3 doesn't sufficiently restrict or validate the paths used for autoloading.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
    *   **Affected F3 Component:**  The `AUTOLOAD` global variable and F3's class loading mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   F3 could implement stricter validation of `AUTOLOAD` paths, potentially using a whitelist approach or disallowing relative paths. This is a mitigation *within F3*.
        *   F3's documentation should strongly emphasize the security risks of `AUTOLOAD` and provide clear guidance on secure configuration.

## Threat: [Template Injection (via F3's *Default* Template Engine)](./threats/template_injection__via_f3's_default_template_engine_.md)

*   **Threat:** Template Injection (via F3's *Default* Template Engine)
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into the application's templates *specifically exploiting vulnerabilities in F3's default template engine*. This is distinct from general template injection; it focuses on flaws *within F3's built-in templating*. If the default engine lacks robust escaping mechanisms or has known vulnerabilities, this is a direct threat.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS), *potential* server-side code execution (depending on the vulnerability), data theft, defacement.
    *   **Affected F3 Component:** F3's default template engine (`Template` class, and its built-in escaping mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   F3's default template engine *must* have robust and secure escaping mechanisms. This is a mitigation *within F3*.
        *   F3 should undergo regular security audits of its default template engine.
        *   F3's documentation should clearly explain how to use the escaping mechanisms correctly and emphasize the importance of escaping all user-provided data.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering (If F3 *loads* config in an unsafe way)](./threats/configuration_file_tampering__if_f3_loads_config_in_an_unsafe_way_.md)

* **Threat:** Configuration File Tampering (If F3 *loads* config in an unsafe way)
    * **Description:** While file permissions are a server-level concern, *if* F3 itself has vulnerabilities in how it *loads* or *processes* configuration files (e.g., allowing code execution within config files, or not properly validating the contents of config files *before* using them), then this becomes a direct F3 threat. This is *not* about file permissions, but about F3's internal handling of configuration data.
    * **Impact:** Application misconfiguration, data breaches, denial of service, *potential code execution* (if the attacker can inject malicious code into the configuration *and F3 executes it*).
    * **Affected F3 Component:** Configuration files and F3's configuration loading mechanism (e.g., how it parses INI files or other config formats).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * F3 *must* load and process configuration files securely. This includes validating the contents of the files and avoiding any mechanisms that could allow code execution within the configuration. This is a mitigation *within F3*.
        * F3 should provide clear documentation on secure configuration practices, including recommendations for file permissions and the use of environment variables.
