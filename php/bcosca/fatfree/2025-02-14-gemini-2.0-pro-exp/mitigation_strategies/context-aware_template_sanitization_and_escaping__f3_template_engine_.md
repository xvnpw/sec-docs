Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Context-Aware Template Sanitization and Escaping" mitigation strategy for a Fat-Free Framework (F3) application.

## Deep Analysis: Context-Aware Template Sanitization and Escaping (F3)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Context-Aware Template Sanitization and Escaping" strategy in mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Template Injection, and HTML Injection vulnerabilities within an F3 application.  This includes identifying gaps in the current implementation, recommending specific improvements, and providing a clear understanding of the residual risks.  The ultimate goal is to ensure the application's templates are robust against injection attacks.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the F3 template engine and its interaction with user-provided data.  It covers:

*   All F3 template files (`.html`, `.htm`, or other extensions configured for F3's template engine).
*   All PHP code that passes data to F3 templates.
*   Integration points with external libraries like HTML Purifier.
*   JavaScript and CSS code embedded within or interacting with F3 templates.
*   The current implementation of escaping and sanitization within the application.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities outside the scope of template rendering (e.g., SQL injection, file inclusion, etc.).  While these are important, they are addressed by separate mitigation strategies.
*   General server-side security configurations (e.g., web server hardening, firewall rules).
*   Client-side JavaScript vulnerabilities *unrelated* to data rendered by F3.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough manual review of the application's codebase, focusing on:
    *   Identification of all user input sources.
    *   Tracing data flow from input to template rendering.
    *   Examination of F3 template syntax for proper escaping and sanitization.
    *   Assessment of pre-validation logic.
    *   Identification of any use of `raw()`.
    *   Verification of HTML Purifier integration (if present).
    *   Analysis of JavaScript/CSS handling within templates.

2.  **Static Analysis (if applicable):**  Employ static analysis tools (if available and suitable for PHP and F3) to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities related to escaping and sanitization.  This can help identify patterns of misuse or missing escapes.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Conduct targeted penetration testing to attempt to exploit potential XSS, Template Injection, and HTML Injection vulnerabilities.  This will involve crafting malicious payloads and observing the application's response.

4.  **Gap Analysis:**  Compare the current implementation against the ideal implementation described in the mitigation strategy.  Identify specific areas where improvements are needed.

5.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the residual risk after implementing the recommended improvements.  This will consider the likelihood and impact of successful attacks.

6.  **Recommendations:**  Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for improving the application's security posture.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

Now, let's dive into the specific aspects of the mitigation strategy:

**2.1. Identify User Inputs:**

*   **Action:**  Create a comprehensive list of all sources of user input.  This includes:
    *   Form submissions (GET and POST parameters).
    *   URL parameters (query strings).
    *   Data retrieved from databases (if user-modifiable).
    *   Data from external APIs (if user-influenced).
    *   File uploads (filenames, content).
    *   Cookies (if used in templates).
    *   HTTP headers (if used in templates).
*   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine controllers, models, and any other code that interacts with external data.  Look for `$f3->get('PARAMS...')`, `$f3->get('POST...')`, `$f3->get('GET...')`, `$f3->get('COOKIE...')`, etc.
*   **Example:**
    ```php
    // Controller
    $username = $f3->get('POST.username'); // User input from a form
    $comment = $f3->get('GET.comment');   // User input from a URL parameter
    $f3->set('username', $username);
    $f3->set('comment', $comment);

    // Template
    <h1>Welcome, {{ @username | esc }}!</h1>
    <p>Your comment: {{ @comment | esc }}</p>
    ```

**2.2. Pre-Validation:**

*   **Action:**  Implement strict input validation *before* any escaping.  This should:
    *   Define expected data types (string, integer, email, etc.).
    *   Set length limits.
    *   Enforce allowed character sets (e.g., alphanumeric only).
    *   Use regular expressions for complex patterns.
    *   Reject invalid input with appropriate error messages.
*   **Code Review Focus:**  Look for validation logic *before* data is passed to the template.  Check for use of PHP's `filter_var`, `ctype_*` functions, regular expressions, and custom validation functions.
*   **Example:**
    ```php
    $username = $f3->get('POST.username');
    if (!preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20}$/', $username)) {
        $f3->error(400, 'Invalid username format.'); // Reject invalid input
    }
    $f3->set('username', $username);
    ```
*   **Benefit:**  Pre-validation reduces the attack surface by preventing unexpected data from reaching the template engine.  It also improves data quality.

**2.3. Context-Specific Escaping:**

*   **Action:**  Use the correct F3 escaping function for each context:
    *   **HTML Content:** `{{ @variable | esc }}` (or `$f3->esc($variable)`) - Escapes characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`.  This is the most common and default escaping.
    *   **HTML Attributes:** `{{ @variable | encode }}` - Encodes characters to be safe within HTML attributes.  This is crucial for attributes like `href`, `src`, `onclick`, etc.
    *   **JSON:** `{{ @variable | stringify }}` - Converts a variable to a JSON string, suitable for use in JavaScript.
    *   **`raw()`:**  Avoid `raw()` unless absolutely necessary.  If used, provide a *detailed* comment explaining why escaping is being bypassed and what measures are in place to ensure safety.  This should be a *very* rare occurrence.
*   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine every instance of variable output in templates.  Verify that the correct escaping function is used based on the surrounding HTML context.  Pay close attention to attributes and JavaScript/CSS contexts.
*   **Examples:**
    ```html
    <!-- HTML Content -->
    <p>Hello, {{ @username | esc }}!</p>

    <!-- HTML Attribute (href) -->
    <a href="/user/{{ @username | encode }}">Profile</a>

    <!-- HTML Attribute (onclick) - Requires careful handling -->
    <button onclick="alert('{{ @message | encode }}');">Click Me</button>

    <!-- JavaScript (using JSON) -->
    <script>
        var userData = {{ @userData | stringify }};
        console.log(userData.name); // Access data safely
    </script>

    <!-- AVOID: raw() without strong justification -->
    <!-- <p>{{ @userInput | raw }}</p>  DANGEROUS! -->
    ```
*   **Key Point:**  Incorrect escaping can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.  For example, using `esc` within an `href` attribute will not prevent JavaScript execution if the attacker provides a `javascript:` URL.

**2.4. HTML Purifier Integration:**

*   **Action:**  Integrate HTML Purifier for sanitizing complex HTML input.  This is *not* a replacement for F3's escaping, but an additional layer of defense.
    *   Configure HTML Purifier with a whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes.
    *   Use HTML Purifier *before* passing data to the F3 template.
*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Check for the presence of the HTML Purifier library.
    *   Verify that HTML Purifier is being used correctly, with a well-defined configuration.
    *   Ensure that the output of HTML Purifier is then properly escaped by F3 (if necessary, depending on the context).
*   **Example:**
    ```php
    // Assuming HTML Purifier is installed and configured
    $config = HTMLPurifier_Config::createDefault();
    $config->set('HTML.Allowed', 'p,a[href],strong,em,ul,ol,li,br'); // Whitelist
    $purifier = new HTMLPurifier($config);

    $userInput = $f3->get('POST.userInput'); // Assume this contains HTML
    $cleanHtml = $purifier->purify($userInput);

    $f3->set('cleanHtml', $cleanHtml);

    // Template
    <div>{{ @cleanHtml | esc }}</div>  <!-- Still escape, even after purification -->
    ```
*   **Benefit:**  HTML Purifier removes potentially dangerous HTML elements and attributes, reducing the risk of XSS even if F3 escaping is bypassed or misconfigured.

**2.5. JavaScript/CSS Escaping (with F3 context):**

*   **Action:**  If embedding user data within `<script>` or `<style>` tags, use appropriate escaping techniques.  F3's `stringify` is useful for JSON data within JavaScript.  For other cases, consider dedicated JavaScript/CSS escaping libraries.
*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Identify any instances of user data being directly embedded within `<script>` or `<style>` tags.
    *   Verify that proper escaping is being used.  This is often *more complex* than HTML escaping.
    *   Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of inline scripts and styles.
*   **Example (using a dedicated JavaScript escaping library - hypothetical):**
    ```php
    // Assume a library like "JavaScriptEscaper" exists
    $userInput = $f3->get('POST.userInput');
    $escapedInput = JavaScriptEscaper::escape($userInput);

    $f3->set('escapedInput', $escapedInput);

    // Template
    <script>
        var message = "{{ @escapedInput }}"; // No F3 escaping here, rely on the library
        alert(message);
    </script>
    ```
*   **Key Point:**  JavaScript and CSS contexts have their own unique escaping rules.  F3's built-in functions may not be sufficient for all cases.

**2.6. Regular Audits:**

*   **Action:**  Conduct regular code reviews and penetration tests to identify and address any new vulnerabilities or regressions.
*   **Code Review Focus:**  Repeat the code review steps outlined above on a regular basis (e.g., quarterly, after major code changes).
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform regular penetration testing, specifically targeting template injection and XSS vulnerabilities.

### 3. Gap Analysis and Risk Assessment

Based on the "Currently Implemented" and "Missing Implementation" sections of the original mitigation strategy description, we can identify the following gaps:

*   **Inconsistent Context-Specific Escaping:**  The application uses `{{ @variable | esc }}` in some places, but likely not consistently in all contexts (e.g., HTML attributes, JavaScript).
*   **Missing HTML Purifier Integration:**  HTML Purifier is not currently used, leaving the application vulnerable to complex HTML-based XSS attacks.
*   **Inconsistent JavaScript/CSS Escaping:**  There's no mention of specific JavaScript/CSS escaping techniques, indicating a potential gap.
*   **Lack of Regular Audits:**  No formal process for regular template audits is in place.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **XSS:**  The risk of XSS is currently **High**.  The inconsistent escaping and lack of HTML Purifier leave significant vulnerabilities.
*   **Template Injection:**  The risk of Template Injection is also **High**, as the lack of consistent escaping and audits could allow attackers to inject malicious template code.
*   **HTML Injection:**  The risk of HTML Injection is **Medium**.  Basic escaping provides some protection, but the lack of HTML Purifier increases the risk.

### 4. Recommendations

1.  **Implement Consistent Context-Specific Escaping:**  Review *all* F3 templates and ensure the correct escaping function (`esc`, `encode`, `stringify`) is used for each variable based on its context.  Prioritize HTML attributes and JavaScript/CSS contexts.

2.  **Integrate HTML Purifier:**  Install and configure HTML Purifier with a strict whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes.  Use it to sanitize any user-provided HTML *before* passing it to F3 templates.

3.  **Implement Robust JavaScript/CSS Escaping:**  If user data is embedded within `<script>` or `<style>` tags, use a dedicated JavaScript/CSS escaping library or carefully implement manual escaping techniques.  Consider using F3's `stringify` for JSON data within JavaScript.

4.  **Establish a Regular Audit Process:**  Conduct code reviews and penetration tests at least quarterly, and after any significant code changes, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

5.  **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests that check for correct escaping. This can be done by creating test cases that include potentially malicious input and verifying that the output is correctly escaped.

6.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities. CSP allows you to define a whitelist of sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.). This can prevent the execution of malicious scripts injected by attackers.

7. **Training:** Provide training to developers on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on XSS prevention and the proper use of F3's escaping functions and HTML Purifier.

### 5. Residual Risk

After implementing these recommendations, the residual risk will be significantly reduced:

*   **XSS:**  The risk of XSS will be reduced to **Low**.  Consistent escaping, HTML Purifier, and CSP will provide multiple layers of defense.
*   **Template Injection:**  The risk of Template Injection will be reduced to **Low**.  Consistent escaping and regular audits will make it much harder for attackers to inject malicious template code.
*   **HTML Injection:**  The risk of HTML Injection will be reduced to **Low**.  HTML Purifier and escaping will effectively neutralize most HTML injection attempts.

However, it's important to remember that *no system is perfectly secure*.  New vulnerabilities may be discovered, and attackers are constantly developing new techniques.  Therefore, ongoing vigilance and regular security updates are essential. The combination of pre-validation, context-aware escaping, HTML purification, and regular audits provides a strong defense against injection attacks in F3 applications.
