## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Template Engine (Template) Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_template_engine__template__vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **1.1.1 Insufficient Input Sanitization in Template Variables [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into template variables that are not properly escaped before being rendered in the HTML output.
        *   **Attack Vector:**  User input (e.g., form fields, URL parameters) is directly used in template variables without proper sanitization or encoding.
        *   **Example:**  If a template has `{{ @userInput }}`, and `@userInput` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the script will execute in the user's browser.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Consistently use F3's escaping functions (e.g., `{{ @variable | esc }}`) for all template variables that might contain user input. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   **1.1.2 Exploiting `raw` filter misuse [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The `raw` filter in F3's template engine disables escaping, making it a prime target for XSS attacks if used improperly.
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Developers use the `raw` filter on user-supplied data without performing rigorous input validation *before* using the filter.
        *   **Example:** `{{ @userInput | raw }}` with malicious `@userInput` will inject the raw, unescaped content.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid using `raw` whenever possible. If it's absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation *before* applying the `raw` filter.  Consider alternative approaches that don't require disabling escaping.

*   **1.2 Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **1.2.1 User-controlled input directly influencing template file selection or content. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate user input to control which template file is loaded or to inject arbitrary code into the template itself, leading to remote code execution.
        *   **Attack Vector:**  User input is used to construct the template file path or is directly embedded within the template content without proper sanitization.
        *   **Example:**  If the application uses `render('templates/' . $_GET['page'] . '.html')`, an attacker could supply `page=../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt an LFI attack, or inject template engine directives to execute code.
        *   **Mitigation:**  *Never* allow user input to directly determine the template file path. Use a whitelist of allowed template names.  Sanitize all user input used within templates, even if it's not directly controlling the file path.

*   **1.3 Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Template Paths**
    *   **1.3.1 User-controlled input manipulating template paths to access arbitrary files. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Attackers manipulate user-supplied input that is used to construct template file paths, allowing them to access files outside the intended template directory.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to SSTI (1.2.1), but the goal is to read arbitrary files on the server rather than execute code within the template engine.
        *   **Example:** If the application loads templates based on user input without proper validation, an attacker could try to access `/etc/passwd` or other sensitive files.
        *   **Mitigation:** *Never* allow user input to directly construct template paths. Use a whitelist of allowed template directories and filenames. Implement strict path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., using `../`).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.1 Route Hijacking / Parameter Tampering [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **2.1.1 Manipulating route parameters to access unauthorized resources or execute unintended actions. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers modify URL parameters or other route data to bypass access controls or trigger unintended behavior in the application.
        *   **Attack Vector:**  The application relies solely on route definitions for security, without performing additional authorization checks within the route handlers.
        *   **Example:**  If a route is defined as `/user/{id}`, an attacker might change the `{id}` to access another user's data.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict input validation and authorization checks *within* each route handler.  Don't rely solely on route definitions for security.  Use parameterized queries for database interactions within route handlers.

*   **2.2 Denial of Service (DoS) via Route Flooding [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **2.2.1 Sending a large number of requests to a specific route, overwhelming the application. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers send a massive number of requests to a particular route, consuming server resources and making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
        *   **Attack Vector:**  The application lacks rate limiting or other DoS protection mechanisms.
        *   **Example:**  Repeatedly requesting a resource-intensive route (e.g., one that performs complex database queries or image processing) can overwhelm the server.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement rate limiting on all routes, especially those that perform resource-intensive operations.  Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to mitigate DDoS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Database Abstraction Layer (DB) Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_database_abstraction_layer__db__vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **3.1 SQL Injection (if using F3's DB layer) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **3.1.1 Insufficient input sanitization in database queries. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries through user input, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
        *   **Attack Vector:**  User input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
        *   **Example:**  `$db->exec("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_GET['username'] . "'");` is vulnerable if `$_GET['username']` is not properly sanitized.
        *   **Mitigation:**  *Always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements.  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating user input.

*   **3.2 NoSQL Injection (if using a NoSQL database with F3)**
    *   **3.2.1 Similar to SQL Injection, but targeting NoSQL query languages. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into NoSQL queries, exploiting vulnerabilities in the NoSQL database's query language.
        *   **Attack Vector:** User input is used to construct NoSQL queries without proper sanitization.
        *   **Example:** Similar to SQL injection, but the injected code would be specific to the NoSQL database being used (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
        *   **Mitigation:** Use appropriate sanitization and validation techniques for the specific NoSQL database. Avoid dynamic query construction with user input. Use the database driver's built-in mechanisms for safe query building.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_session_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **5.2 Session Hijacking [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **5.2.1 Stealing a valid session ID. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a legitimate user's session ID, allowing them to impersonate the user and gain access to their account.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Session IDs are exposed through insecure channels (e.g., HTTP, URLs), or are predictable, or are vulnerable to sniffing on an insecure network.
        *   **Example:** An attacker might use a packet sniffer on an unencrypted Wi-Fi network to capture session cookies.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use HTTPS for all communication. Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies. Implement session timeout mechanisms. Use strong, randomly generated session IDs.

*   **5.1 Session Fixation**
    *   **5.1.1 Setting a known session ID for a victim. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Attacker sets session ID for victim, and when victim authenticates, attacker uses the known session ID to hijack the account.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Application accepts session identifiers from URL parameters or POST data without proper validation or regeneration after authentication.
        *   **Example:** Attacker sends a link with a predefined session ID to the victim. When the victim logs in, the attacker uses the same session ID to access the victim's account.
        *   **Mitigation:** Regenerate session IDs after authentication.  Use F3's built-in session management features correctly.  Ensure session IDs are not exposed in URLs or other insecure locations.
