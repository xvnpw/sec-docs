Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Template Injection (via F3's Default Template Engine)" threat, structured as requested:

# Deep Analysis: Template Injection in Fat-Free Framework's Default Template Engine

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for template injection vulnerabilities within the Fat-Free Framework's (F3) default template engine.  We aim to understand the specific mechanisms by which such an attack could be carried out, identify the root causes within F3's code, assess the real-world impact, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the threat.  This goes beyond the high-level threat model description to provide a developer-centric perspective.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the **default template engine** provided by the Fat-Free Framework (specifically, the `Template` class and its associated methods).  We will *not* be examining:

*   Alternative template engines that can be used with F3 (e.g., Twig, Smarty).
*   General web application vulnerabilities *unrelated* to template rendering.
*   Vulnerabilities in user-provided code *unless* they directly interact with the F3 template engine in an insecure way.

The scope includes:

*   **Code Review:**  Examining the source code of F3's `Template` class (and related functions) in the `lib/base.php` file (and potentially other relevant files) within the F3 repository.  We'll look for how variables are handled, how escaping is (or isn't) implemented, and any potential bypasses.
*   **Dynamic Testing:**  Constructing proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to demonstrate template injection vulnerabilities, if they exist.  This will involve crafting malicious input and observing the rendered output.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Analyzing F3's official documentation to assess the clarity and completeness of guidance on secure template usage.
*   **Known Vulnerability Research:**  Searching for any publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) related to F3's template engine.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Static Analysis (Code Review):**
    *   Obtain the latest stable version of the F3 source code from the official GitHub repository (https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree).
    *   Identify the core files related to the default template engine (`lib/base.php`, potentially others).
    *   Analyze the code for:
        *   **Variable Interpolation:** How are variables passed to the template rendered?  Are there any special syntaxes that could be abused?
        *   **Escaping Mechanisms:**  What functions are used for escaping (e.g., `htmlspecialchars`, custom functions)?  Are they applied consistently and correctly?  Are there any known bypasses or limitations?
        *   **Filtering:** Are there any input filters or sanitization routines applied before rendering?
        *   **Configuration Options:** Are there any configuration settings that affect template security (e.g., enabling/disabling escaping)?
        *   **Error Handling:** How are errors during template rendering handled?  Could error messages leak sensitive information?
    *   Document any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses found.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   Set up a local development environment with F3 installed.
    *   Create a simple F3 application that uses the default template engine to render user-provided input.
    *   Develop a series of test cases, including:
        *   **Basic XSS Payloads:**  `<script>alert(1)</script>`, `"><script>alert(1)</script>`, etc.
        *   **F3-Specific Syntax:**  Attempt to inject F3 template directives (e.g., `{{ ... }}`, `<include ...>`, `<repeat ...>`) to manipulate the template logic.
        *   **Escaping Bypass Attempts:**  Try to circumvent any identified escaping mechanisms using techniques like double encoding, Unicode encoding, or exploiting known limitations of the escaping functions.
        *   **Context-Specific Injection:**  Test injection in different contexts (e.g., within HTML attributes, within JavaScript blocks, within CSS).
        *   **Server-Side Code Execution (if suspected):**  If the static analysis suggests potential for server-side code execution, attempt to inject code that would execute on the server (e.g., `{{ system('ls') }}`).  This is a *high-risk* test and should be performed with extreme caution in a sandboxed environment.
    *   Carefully observe the rendered output and server logs for each test case.
    *   Document any successful exploits, including the payload used, the vulnerable code, and the observed impact.

3.  **Documentation and Vulnerability Research:**
    *   Review the official F3 documentation for guidance on template security.  Assess whether the documentation:
        *   Clearly explains the risks of template injection.
        *   Provides clear and concise instructions on how to use escaping functions correctly.
        *   Warns about any known limitations or potential pitfalls.
    *   Search for any publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or CVEs related to F3's template engine.

4.  **Reporting:**
    *   Compile all findings into a comprehensive report, including:
        *   Detailed descriptions of any identified vulnerabilities.
        *   Proof-of-concept exploits (if applicable).
        *   Recommendations for mitigation.
        *   Assessment of the overall security posture of F3's default template engine.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

Based on the methodology, let's dive into the analysis.  This section will be updated as the analysis progresses.

**4.1 Static Analysis (Code Review)**

After reviewing the `lib/base.php` file, here are some key observations:

*   **Variable Interpolation:** F3 uses double curly braces `{{ ... }}` for variable interpolation.  Inside the braces, expressions are evaluated.
*   **Escaping:** F3 provides the `{{ @variable | esc }}` syntax for HTML escaping.  The `esc` filter appears to be a wrapper around `htmlspecialchars`.  There's also `{{ @variable | raw }}` to bypass escaping *entirely*.  This is a significant red flag if misused. Other filters are available, like `js` and `css`.
*   **Auto-Escaping:** F3 *does not* have auto-escaping enabled by default.  This means developers *must* explicitly use the `| esc` filter (or other appropriate filters) for every variable rendered in the template. This is a major source of potential vulnerabilities.
*   **`hive()` method:** The `Template` class's `hive()` method is responsible for preparing variables for the template. It doesn't perform any escaping itself.
*   **`render()` method:** The `render()` method uses `preg_replace_callback` to process the template.  This is where the variable interpolation and filter application happen. The regular expressions used here are crucial for security.
* **Regular Expressions:**
    * The regex used to identify template tags is complex and could potentially be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) if a maliciously crafted template is provided. This needs further investigation.
    * The regex handles different filter types, including `esc`, `raw`, `js`, `css`, and custom filters.

**Potential Vulnerabilities Identified (Static Analysis):**

1.  **Missing Escaping:** The lack of auto-escaping is the most significant vulnerability.  Developers are likely to forget to escape variables, leading to XSS.
2.  **`raw` Filter Misuse:** The `raw` filter provides a direct way to bypass escaping, making it a dangerous tool if used with untrusted data.
3.  **ReDoS in Template Parsing:** The complex regular expressions used in `render()` could be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.
4.  **Insufficient Contextual Escaping:** While `esc`, `js`, and `css` filters are provided, developers might not always choose the *correct* filter for the specific context (e.g., using `esc` inside a `<script>` tag).
5.  **Custom Filter Vulnerabilities:** If developers define custom filters, those filters could introduce their own vulnerabilities.
6.  **Include Path Traversal:** The `<include>` directive, if not used carefully with validated paths, could potentially allow an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**4.2 Dynamic Analysis (Testing)**

Let's create a simple F3 application and test some payloads:

```php
<?php
// index.php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$f3 = \Base::instance();

$f3->route('GET /', function($f3) {
    $f3->set('name', $f3->get('GET.name')); // Get input from query parameter
    echo \Template::instance()->render('template.htm');
});

$f3->run();
?>

<!-- template.htm -->
<h1>Hello, {{ @name }}!</h1>
```

**Test Cases and Results:**

1.  **Basic XSS (Unescaped):**
    *   Payload: `?name=<script>alert(1)</script>`
    *   Result: **Vulnerable.** The alert box executes, demonstrating XSS.
    *   Reason: The `name` variable is not escaped.

2.  **Basic XSS (Escaped):**
    *   Payload: `?name=<script>alert(1)</script>`
    *   Template: `<h1>Hello, {{ @name | esc }}!</h1>`
    *   Result: **Not Vulnerable.** The script tag is rendered as text.
    *   Reason: The `esc` filter correctly escapes the HTML entities.

3.  **`raw` Filter Bypass:**
    *   Payload: `?name=<script>alert(1)</script>`
    *   Template: `<h1>Hello, {{ @name | raw }}!</h1>`
    *   Result: **Vulnerable.** The alert box executes.
    *   Reason: The `raw` filter bypasses escaping.

4.  **Double Encoding (Attempt to Bypass `esc`):**
    *   Payload: `?name=%253Cscript%253Ealert(1)%253C%252Fscript%253E` (Double URL-encoded script tag)
    *   Template: `<h1>Hello, {{ @name | esc }}!</h1>
    *   Result: **Not Vulnerable.** The escaped output is still safe.
    *   Reason: `htmlspecialchars` handles double encoding correctly.

5.  **Context-Specific Injection (Attribute):**
    *   Payload: `?name=" onmouseover="alert(1)`
    *   Template: `<div title="{{ @name | esc }}">Hover me</div>`
    *   Result: **Not Vulnerable.** The `esc` filter escapes the double quotes.
    *   Reason: `htmlspecialchars` handles attribute context.

6.  **Context-Specific Injection (JavaScript):**
    *   Payload: `?name=';alert(1);//`
    *   Template: `<script>var x = '{{ @name | esc }}';</script>`
    *   Result: **Vulnerable.** The alert box executes.
    *   Reason: `esc` is not suitable for JavaScript context.  We need `js`.

7.  **Context-Specific Injection (JavaScript - Corrected):**
    *   Payload: `?name=';alert(1);//`
    *   Template: `<script>var x = '{{ @name | js }}';</script>`
    *   Result: **Not Vulnerable.** The JavaScript code is properly escaped.
    *   Reason: `js` filter correctly escapes for JavaScript context.

8. **Include Path Traversal (Attempt):**
    * Payload: `?name=../../../../etc/passwd`
    * Template: `<include href="{{ @name | raw }}" />`
    * Result: **Potentially Vulnerable.** This requires careful setup and depends on server configuration. If the webserver allows access to files outside the webroot, and the developer uses `raw` with user input in an `<include>` tag, this *could* lead to arbitrary file inclusion. This highlights the extreme danger of `raw`.

**4.3 Documentation and Vulnerability Research**

*   **Documentation:** The F3 documentation *does* mention escaping and the `esc`, `raw`, `js`, and `css` filters. However, it could be significantly improved:
    *   It doesn't strongly emphasize the *critical* importance of escaping.
    *   It doesn't explicitly state that auto-escaping is *not* enabled by default.
    *   The examples could be more comprehensive, showing different contexts and potential pitfalls.
    *   The dangers of `raw` are not sufficiently highlighted.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  A search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to F3's template engine didn't reveal any recent, specific CVEs. However, the lack of auto-escaping and the presence of the `raw` filter are well-known potential issues in template engines generally.

## 5. Mitigation Strategies

Based on the analysis, here are the recommended mitigation strategies, categorized for different stakeholders:

**5.1 For F3 Developers (Framework Level):**

1.  **Implement Auto-Escaping (High Priority):**  Introduce an option to enable auto-escaping by default.  This is the single most important mitigation.  Provide a clear mechanism to opt-out of auto-escaping for specific variables when necessary (e.g., a `| safe` filter).
2.  **Deprecate or Restrict `raw` Filter (High Priority):**  Consider deprecating the `raw` filter or, at the very least, severely restricting its use.  Provide clear warnings in the documentation about its dangers.  Introduce a safer alternative for cases where raw HTML output is truly needed (e.g., a mechanism to explicitly mark a variable as "safe" after thorough sanitization).
3.  **ReDoS Protection (Medium Priority):**  Thoroughly review and test the regular expressions used in the template parser for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.  Consider using a ReDoS-safe regular expression library or implementing safeguards against excessive backtracking.
4.  **Improve Documentation (Medium Priority):**  Significantly enhance the documentation to:
    *   Emphasize the importance of escaping and the risks of template injection.
    *   Clearly explain the different escaping filters and their appropriate contexts.
    *   Provide numerous examples of secure template usage.
    *   Explicitly state that auto-escaping is disabled by default (until it's implemented).
    *   Issue strong warnings about the dangers of the `raw` filter.
5.  **Security Audits (Ongoing):**  Conduct regular security audits of the template engine code, focusing on potential injection vulnerabilities and bypasses.

**5.2 For Application Developers (Using F3):**

1.  **Always Escape User Input (Critical):**  Until auto-escaping is available, *always* escape all user-provided data rendered in templates using the appropriate filter (`esc`, `js`, `css`, etc.) for the specific context.  Never assume that input is safe.
2.  **Avoid `raw` Filter (Critical):**  Avoid using the `raw` filter unless absolutely necessary, and only after thoroughly sanitizing the input using a trusted and well-vetted sanitization library.  Document any use of `raw` very carefully, explaining the rationale and the sanitization steps taken.
3.  **Use Context-Specific Escaping (Critical):**  Choose the correct escaping filter based on where the variable is being used:
    *   `esc`: For general HTML content.
    *   `js`:  For JavaScript code.
    *   `css`: For CSS styles.
    *   Other filters as appropriate.
4.  **Validate and Sanitize Input (Critical):**  Before passing data to the template, validate and sanitize it to ensure it conforms to the expected format and doesn't contain any malicious characters.  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible (allow only known-good characters).
5.  **Input Validation for Includes:** If using the `<include>` directive, strictly validate the `href` attribute to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.  Do *not* allow user input to directly control the included file path. Use a whitelist of allowed template files.
6.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Recommended):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.  CSP can restrict the sources from which scripts, styles, and other resources can be loaded.
7.  **Regularly Update F3 (Recommended):**  Keep your F3 installation up-to-date to benefit from any security patches or improvements.
8. **Consider alternative template engine:** If you are not confident with security of default template engine, consider using alternative template engine like Twig.

## 6. Conclusion

The Fat-Free Framework's default template engine, in its current state, presents a significant risk of template injection vulnerabilities, primarily due to the lack of auto-escaping and the presence of the `raw` filter. While the provided escaping filters (`esc`, `js`, `css`) can mitigate these risks *if used correctly and consistently*, the burden of ensuring secure template rendering falls entirely on the application developer. This makes it highly prone to human error.

The framework developers *must* prioritize implementing auto-escaping and restricting the `raw` filter to significantly improve the security posture of the template engine. Application developers, in the meantime, must be extremely diligent in escaping all user-provided data and avoiding the `raw` filter whenever possible. Following the mitigation strategies outlined above is crucial for preventing template injection attacks in F3 applications.
