# Threat Model Analysis for egulias/emailvalidator

## Threat: [Input Validation Bypass](./threats/input_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially formatted, invalid email address that circumvents the library's validation rules due to flaws in its regex or validation logic. The attacker exploits these weaknesses to pass invalid input as valid.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on how the application uses the supposedly validated email, the impact could range from data corruption to logic errors, and potentially more severe issues if the email is used in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., account creation, password reset).
*   **Affected Component:**  Core validation logic, specifically the various validator classes (e.g., `RFCValidation`, `SpoofcheckValidation`) and the regular expressions they employ.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `egulias/emailvalidator` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing validation flaws.
    *   Implement additional server-side validation beyond the library's checks, especially for critical applications, to act as a secondary defense.
    *   Thoroughly test the application with a wide range of valid and invalid email addresses, including edge cases and known bypass techniques relevant to email validation.
    *   Consider using multiple independent validation libraries or approaches for redundancy and increased security against specific bypasses.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a large number of specially crafted, extremely long, or computationally expensive email addresses directly targeting the `emailvalidator` library's processing capabilities. This can overwhelm the library's validation process, consuming excessive CPU or memory and leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability lies within the library's handling of complex or malicious input patterns.
*   **Impact:** The application or server becomes unresponsive due to the resource exhaustion within the email validation process, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services. This can lead to significant business disruption and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** The core validation functions that process the input string, particularly the regular expression matching engine and any iterative or recursive validation steps within the library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on email processing endpoints to restrict the number of validation requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
    *   Set reasonable limits on the maximum length of email addresses accepted by the application *before* passing them to the validator to prevent excessively long strings from being processed.
    *   Implement timeouts for email validation processes within the application to prevent indefinite resource consumption if the validator gets stuck on a complex input.
    *   Monitor server resource usage specifically during email validation to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.
