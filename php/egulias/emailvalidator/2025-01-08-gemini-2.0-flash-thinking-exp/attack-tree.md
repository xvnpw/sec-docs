## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Bypass Validation Logic](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__bypass_validation_logic.md)

This is a critical point because if the validation logic can be bypassed, the application loses its primary defense against malformed or malicious email addresses. This allows attackers to introduce arbitrary input that can be leveraged for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Provide Unexpectedly Valid Input](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__provide_unexpectedly_valid_input.md)

Attackers craft email addresses that, while technically valid according to the `emailvalidator`, contain unexpected or malicious characters or structures that the application's subsequent processing logic does not handle securely.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Inject Malicious Characters (e.g., control characters, shell metacharacters) (Local Part)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__inject_malicious_characters__e_g___control_characters__shell_metacharacters___local_part_249497c0.md)

Attackers embed characters like backticks, semicolons, or newline characters within the local part of the email address. If the application naively uses this email address in a system command or log entry without proper sanitization, it can lead to:

*   **Command Injection:** The injected characters are interpreted as commands by the operating system, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Log Injection:** The injected characters manipulate log entries, potentially hiding malicious activity or injecting false information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Exploit Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Handling](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__exploit_internationalized_domain_name__idn__handling.md)

Attackers leverage the complexities of handling international domain names (IDNs) to register visually similar domain names using different character sets.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Homograph Attack](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__homograph_attack.md)

Attackers register domain names that look identical to legitimate domains but use characters from different alphabets (e.g., Cyrillic 'Ð°' instead of Latin 'a'). This can deceive users and applications, leading to:

*   **Account Hijacking:** Users might unknowingly enter their credentials on a fake login page hosted on the homograph domain.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can send emails from the homograph domain, impersonating legitimate organizations to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Trigger Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__trigger_regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

Attackers exploit potential vulnerabilities in the regular expressions used by `emailvalidator` for validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Provide Crafted Input with Repeating Patterns](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__provide_crafted_input_with_repeating_patterns.md)

Attackers send email addresses with specific repeating patterns that cause the regular expression engine to backtrack excessively, consuming significant CPU resources and leading to:

*   **Application Slowdown:** The validation process becomes very slow, impacting the application's responsiveness.
*   **Denial of Service:** The excessive resource consumption can overload the server, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Interaction with Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_interaction_with_application_logic.md)

This critical point highlights the vulnerability arising from how the application handles the output of the `emailvalidator`. Even if the validator correctly identifies a syntactically valid email, the application must still treat it as potentially malicious.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Leverage Incorrect Assumption About Validation Outcome](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__leverage_incorrect_assumption_about_validation_outcome.md)

The application incorrectly assumes that a validated email address is inherently safe and does not require further sanitization before being used in other operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Application assumes a valid email is "safe" for further processing without sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__application_assumes_a_valid_email_is_safe_for_further_processing_without_sanitization.md)

This critical flaw in application logic is the root cause of several potential exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Inject Malicious Payloads in Email Local Part](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__inject_malicious_payloads_in_email_local_part.md)

Attackers embed malicious payloads (e.g., JavaScript code) within the local part of the email address. If the application displays this email address without proper escaping, it can lead to:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The malicious script is executed in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Other Injection Attacks:** Depending on how the email is used, other types of injection attacks might be possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Inject Malicious Payloads in Email Domain Part](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__inject_malicious_payloads_in_email_domain_part.md)

Attackers use the domain part of the email address to point to malicious servers or resources. If the application uses the domain part for external requests without proper validation or sanitization, it can lead to:

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes requests to attacker-controlled servers, potentially exposing internal resources or allowing the attacker to interact with other internal systems.
