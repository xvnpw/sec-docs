# Attack Surface Analysis for egulias/emailvalidator

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

- **Description:**  Attackers craft specific email addresses that cause the regular expressions used by `emailvalidator` to take an extremely long time to evaluate, leading to high CPU usage and potential denial of service.
    - **How emailvalidator Contributes:**  The library relies on regular expressions for validating email address syntax. Complex or poorly optimized regex patterns can be vulnerable to ReDoS.
    - **Example:** An attacker submits an email address like `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@example.com` (with a long sequence of 'a's) if the underlying regex for the local part is vulnerable to backtracking with such input.
    - **Impact:**  Application becomes unresponsive, potentially leading to service disruption for legitimate users. Resource exhaustion on the server.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Keep `emailvalidator` updated: Newer versions may contain fixes for ReDoS vulnerabilities in the regex patterns.
        - Implement timeouts for email validation:  Set a maximum time allowed for the `emailvalidator` to process an email address. If validation takes too long, reject the input.

## Attack Surface: [Inconsistent Handling of Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) and Punycode](./attack_surfaces/inconsistent_handling_of_internationalized_domain_names__idn__and_punycode.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the library's handling of IDNs and Punycode conversion could allow specially crafted domain names to bypass validation or lead to homograph attacks.
    - **How emailvalidator Contributes:** The library needs to correctly convert and validate IDNs. Errors in this process can create vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** An attacker uses a Punycode representation of a domain name that looks like a legitimate domain but points to a malicious server. If the validator doesn't handle this correctly, the malicious domain might be accepted.
    - **Impact:**  Phishing attacks, redirection to malicious websites, bypassing domain whitelists or blacklists.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Keep `emailvalidator` updated: Ensure you are using a version with the latest IDN and Punycode handling improvements.
