# Attack Surface Analysis for egulias/emailvalidator

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers provide specially crafted email addresses that cause the library's regular expressions to enter a catastrophic backtracking state, leading to excessive CPU consumption and denial-of-service.
    * **How EmailValidator Contributes:** If the library uses complex or poorly optimized regular expressions for validation, it can be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.
    * **Example:** An extremely long email address with repeating patterns (e.g., `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...aaaaa@example.com`) might trigger exponential backtracking in a vulnerable regex.
    * **Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, potential service outage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the `egulias/emailvalidator` library updated to benefit from bug fixes and improved regex patterns.
        * Review the library's change logs and issue trackers for reported ReDoS vulnerabilities and update accordingly.
        * Consider using alternative validation methods or libraries if ReDoS vulnerabilities are a persistent concern.
        * Implement timeouts for email validation processes to prevent indefinite resource consumption *within the validation logic*.
