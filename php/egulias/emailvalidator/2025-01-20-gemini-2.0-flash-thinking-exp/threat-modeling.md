# Threat Model Analysis for egulias/emailvalidator

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Email Parsing](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_email_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted, excessively long, or complex email address that causes the regular expressions used by the `emailvalidator` library to consume excessive CPU resources and time, leading to a denial of service. This occurs due to catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine.
*   **Impact:**  Application slowdown, resource exhaustion on the server, potential for complete service disruption, and impact on other users of the application.
*   **Affected Component:**  The underlying regular expressions used within the `EmailLexer` and various validator classes (e.g., those handling local and domain parts).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `emailvalidator` library updated, as newer versions may contain fixes or improvements to the regular expressions to mitigate ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement timeouts for the email validation process to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
    *   Consider using alternative validation methods or libraries if ReDoS vulnerabilities are a significant concern and the current library version is susceptible.
