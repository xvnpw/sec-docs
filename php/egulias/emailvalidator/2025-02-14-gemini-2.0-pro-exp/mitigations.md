# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for egulias/emailvalidator

## Mitigation Strategy: [Choose Appropriate Validation Level](./mitigation_strategies/choose_appropriate_validation_level.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Documentation:**  Thoroughly read the `egulias/email-validator` documentation on GitHub to understand the different validation levels (RFCValidation, NoRFCWarningsValidation, DNSCheckValidation, MultipleValidationWithAnd, SpoofCheckValidation, etc.).  Pay close attention to the specific rules enforced by each level.
    2.  **Assess Needs:** Determine the specific requirements of your application.  Do you need strict RFC compliance?  Is DNS validation essential, or can you rely on format validation alone?  Consider the user experience â€“ overly strict validation can be frustrating.
    3.  **Select Level:** Choose the validation level that best balances security and usability.  Start with `RFCValidation` or `NoRFCWarningsValidation` as a good default.  If DNS validation is required, proceed with caution (see Mitigation #3).  If using `MultipleValidationWithAnd`, ensure all validations are necessary.
    4.  **Document Choice:**  Clearly document the chosen validation level and the rationale behind it in your project's documentation (e.g., in a README, security guidelines, or code comments).
    5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the chosen validation level to ensure it still meets the evolving needs of the application and the threat landscape.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Invalid Email Format Injection (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of accepting email addresses that violate RFC specifications, which could be used for various injection attacks.  The *correct level* is key here.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via DNS (Medium Severity):**  By *avoiding* unnecessary `DNSCheckValidation`, you reduce the risk of DoS attacks targeting your DNS resolution.
    *   **User Frustration (Low Severity):**  Choosing an appropriately permissive level (while still being secure) prevents valid but unusual email addresses from being rejected.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Invalid Email Format Injection:**  Significantly reduces the risk.  The library enforces RFC compliance *at the chosen level*.
    *   **DoS via DNS:**  Reduces the risk by limiting the use of DNS lookups.
    *   **User Frustration:**  Minimizes user frustration by accepting a wider range of valid email addresses.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  `RFCValidation` is currently used in the user registration module (`/app/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**  The contact form (`/app/Controllers/ContactController.php`) currently uses no email validation library.  This needs to be updated to use `RFCValidation`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle DNS Lookup Failures and Timeouts (if using `DNSCheckValidation`)](./mitigation_strategies/handle_dns_lookup_failures_and_timeouts__if_using__dnscheckvalidation__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Timeouts:**  Set a strict timeout for DNS lookups (e.g., 2-3 seconds) when using `DNSCheckValidation`.  This prevents slow DNS servers from blocking your application. This is done *when calling* the library's `DNSCheckValidation`.
    2.  **Handle Exceptions:**  Wrap the `DNSCheckValidation` call in a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions (e.g., `Egulias\EmailValidator\Exception\NoDNSRecord`).  This is specific to how you *use* the library.
    3.  **Fallback Mechanism:**  Implement a fallback mechanism.  If the DNS lookup fails or times out:
        *   **Option 1 (Preferred):**  Log the failure and fall back to a less strict validation level (e.g., `RFCValidation`).  This involves *switching to a different validation object* from the library.
        *   **Option 2:**  Display a user-friendly error message indicating a temporary problem and asking the user to try again later.  *Do not* simply reject the email address.
    4.  **Retry with Backoff:**  Consider implementing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.  If the first DNS lookup fails, wait a short period (e.g., 1 second), then retry.  If it fails again, wait longer (e.g., 2 seconds), and so on.  Limit the number of retries. This logic surrounds the *use* of the library.
    5.  **Log Failures:**  Log all DNS lookup failures and timeouts, including the email address, timestamp, and error details.  This helps with debugging and identifying potential attacks.
    6. **Monitor:** Use application performance monitoring to track DNS resolution times and failure rates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via DNS (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from using slow or malicious DNS servers to make your application unresponsive.  Directly related to how you *handle the results* of `DNSCheckValidation`.
    *   **Information Leakage (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of leaking information about your users (or your server's probing) to external DNS servers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via DNS:**  Significantly reduces the risk by preventing long delays and handling failures gracefully.
    *   **Information Leakage:**  Minimizes the impact by limiting the number of DNS lookups.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  No DNS validation is currently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  If `DNSCheckValidation` is ever implemented, all the steps above must be followed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Address Spoofing Limitations (if using `SpoofCheckValidation`)](./mitigation_strategies/address_spoofing_limitations__if_using__spoofcheckvalidation__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `SpoofCheckValidation`:** If appropriate for your application, use the `SpoofCheckValidation` to detect visually similar characters. This is a direct *use* of the library's functionality.
    2.  **Combine with Other Measures:** While not directly related to the library *itself*, if you are processing *incoming* email, consider combining `SpoofCheckValidation` with sender authentication technologies.
    3.  **Regular Updates:** Stay informed about new spoofing techniques.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Phishing Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Helps detect some phishing attempts that rely on visually similar email addresses.  This is a direct result of *using* `SpoofCheckValidation`.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):**  By reducing phishing success, it indirectly helps prevent account takeover.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Phishing Attacks:**  Reduces the risk, but it's not a foolproof solution.
    *   **Account Takeover:**  Provides a small reduction in risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  `SpoofCheckValidation` is not currently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider adding `SpoofCheckValidation` to the user registration process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle IDNs and Unicode (with `SpoofCheckValidation` and Validation Level Considerations)](./mitigation_strategies/handle_idns_and_unicode__with__spoofcheckvalidation__and_validation_level_considerations_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand IDN Representations:** Be aware of how `email-validator` handles IDNs, particularly the A-label (Punycode) representation it uses internally.
    2.  **Homograph Awareness:** Be aware of potential homograph attacks, and use `SpoofCheckValidation` to help mitigate them. This is a direct interaction with the library.
    3. **Validation Level:** Ensure the chosen validation level correctly handles IDNs. `RFCValidation` and others should support them, but it's crucial to confirm.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Homograph Attacks (Medium Severity):** `SpoofCheckValidation` directly helps mitigate this.
    *   **Data Inconsistency (Low Severity):** Understanding how the library handles IDNs prevents inconsistencies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Homograph Attacks:** Reduces the risk, especially when `SpoofCheckValidation` is used.
    *   **Data Inconsistency:** Prevents issues by understanding the library's IDN handling.

*   **Currently Implemented:** The application does not explicitly use `SpoofCheckValidation`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** The application should consider using `SpoofCheckValidation` to improve IDN-related security.
