*   **Attack Surface: Malicious File Upload via Import Functionality**
    *   **Description:** The application allows users to upload files (CSV, JSON, etc.) to import financial data. This functionality can be exploited by uploading malicious files.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:** The core import feature, designed to ingest user data, inherently creates this attack vector. The variety of supported file formats increases the complexity of secure parsing.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted CSV file containing shell commands disguised as data, which are then executed by the server during the import process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Developers**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all imported data, regardless of file format.
        *   Use secure file parsing libraries that are regularly updated.
        *   Isolate the file processing environment (e.g., using sandboxing or containerization).
        *   Implement file type validation based on content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions.
        *   Limit the size of uploaded files.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Users**
        *   Only import files from trusted sources.
        *   Be cautious about importing files received via email or untrusted websites.

*   **Attack Surface: Logic Flaws in the Rule Engine**
    *   **Description:** Firefly III's rule engine allows users to automate transaction categorization. Complex or poorly designed rules can introduce logical vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:** The flexibility and power of the rule engine, while beneficial, create opportunities for unintended or malicious manipulation of financial data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a set of rules that, when triggered by specific transactions, transfer funds between accounts in a way that benefits the attacker or hides fraudulent activity.
    *   **Impact:** Financial data manipulation, unauthorized transfer of funds, hiding fraudulent transactions, incorrect financial reporting.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Developers**
        *   Implement thorough testing of the rule engine logic, including edge cases and complex rule combinations.
        *   Provide clear documentation and examples of secure rule creation.
        *   Consider implementing safeguards to prevent overly complex or resource-intensive rules.
        *   Log rule executions and modifications for auditing purposes.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Users**
        *   Carefully review and understand the logic of all created rules.
        *   Avoid creating overly complex or nested rules if possible.
        *   Regularly audit existing rules for accuracy and potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Report Generation**
    *   **Description:** If the report generation feature uses a templating engine and allows user input to influence the template, it could be vulnerable to SSTI.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:** The ability to generate custom reports or potentially customize report templates introduces this risk if the templating engine is not handled securely.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious code into a report parameter or a custom template, which is then executed on the server when the report is generated.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Developers**
        *   Avoid allowing user input directly into template code.
        *   Use a sandboxed or logic-less templating engine for report generation.
        *   If user input is necessary, strictly sanitize and validate it before incorporating it into the template.
        *   Regularly update the templating engine to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Users**
        *   Be cautious about using custom report templates from untrusted sources (if this feature exists).

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Handling of External Account Integration (if enabled)**
    *   **Description:** If Firefly III integrates with external financial institutions (e.g., via APIs or OAuth), vulnerabilities in this integration can expose sensitive data.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:** The feature that connects to external accounts to retrieve transaction data introduces risks related to authentication, authorization, and data transfer.
    *   **Example:**  OAuth misconfiguration allows an attacker to intercept the authorization flow and gain access to a user's linked bank account. Or, API keys for external services are stored insecurely, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external financial accounts, data breaches, financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Developers**
        *   Implement secure OAuth flows with proper validation of redirect URIs and state parameters.
        *   Securely store API keys and tokens, preferably using encryption at rest and in transit.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when requesting permissions from external services.
        *   Regularly review and update the integration code to address security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Users**
        *   Be cautious about granting access to external accounts.
        *   Review the permissions requested by Firefly III during the integration process.
        *   Regularly monitor linked accounts for suspicious activity.

*   **Attack Surface: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom Fields or Imported Data**
    *   **Description:** If user-provided data in custom fields or imported data is not properly sanitized before being displayed, it can lead to stored XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:** The ability to create custom fields and import data from various sources introduces opportunities for injecting malicious scripts that are then stored in the database.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a custom transaction description or an imported note. When another user views this transaction, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, and potentially more severe attacks depending on the user's privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Developers**
        *   Implement robust output encoding (context-aware escaping) on all user-provided data before displaying it in the application.
        *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly scan the application for XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies: Users**
        *   Be cautious about clicking on links or interacting with content within the application that seems suspicious.
        *   Keep your web browser up to date with the latest security patches.
