## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit Firefly III's Access Logs](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_firefly_iii's_access_logs.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Audit Firefly III's Access Logs

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Logs:** Find Firefly III's logs. If using Docker, use `docker logs <container_id>`. If installed directly, check Firefly III's documentation (often `storage/logs`).
    2.  **Manual Review:** Regularly review logs. Use `grep`, `awk`, `tail` to filter.
    3.  **Focus on Firefly III Specifics:** Look for:
        *   Failed logins to `/login`.
        *   Logins from unexpected IPs.
        *   Access to sensitive API endpoints.
        *   Firefly III-specific errors.
        *   Activity on disabled features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Detects unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Helps identify data exfiltration.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Detects successful unauthorized logins.
    *   **Exploitation of Application Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Reveals vulnerability exploitation attempts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Early warning of intrusions.
    *   **Data Breach:** Timely intervention.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Secure compromised accounts.
    *   **Exploitation of Application Vulnerabilities:** Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Firefly III *generates* access logs (via Laravel).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No built-in log analysis, alerting, or correlation. No in-app log dashboard.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Control User Permissions within Firefly III](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_control_user_permissions_within_firefly_iii.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:** Strictly Control User Permissions within Firefly III

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access User Management:** Log in as admin, go to user management.

    3.  **Review Existing Users:** Regularly review and revoke unnecessary permissions.
    4.  **Document Permissions:** Keep a record of user permissions.
    5.  **Consider RBAC:** Use RBAC if Firefly III supports it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insider Threat (Medium Severity):** Limits damage from internal users.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Reduces privilege escalation risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized data access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insider Threat:** Reduces impact.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Makes escalation harder.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Directly prevents it.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Firefly III *has* a built-in user management system.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Permission system might lack granularity. No built-in permission change auditing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused Firefly III Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused_firefly_iii_features.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unused Firefly III Features

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Unused Features:** Review documentation and config for unused features (imports, integrations, reports).
    2.  **Disable via Configuration:** Disable in `.env` or config files, or web interface (if available).
    3.  **Test After Disabling:** Test core functionality.
    4.  **Document Disabled Features:** Keep a record.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Application Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Reduces attack surface.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (High Severity):** Reduces zero-day exploit likelihood.

    *   **Exploitation of Application Vulnerabilities:** Reduces attack surface.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Firefly III *allows* disabling *some* features via config.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not all features are easily disabled. A centralized feature management panel would help.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Firefly III's Data Export Functionality](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_firefly_iii's_data_export_functionality.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy:** Monitor Firefly III's Data Export Functionality

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Export Methods:** Find all export methods (CSV, API).
    2.  **Log Export Activity:** If possible, configure Firefly III to log export events (who, when, what).
    3. **Implement Restrictions (If Possible):** Restrict export to specific users/roles, if Firefly III allows.
    4.  **Regularly Review Export Logs:** Manually review logs for suspicious activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Detects/prevents unauthorized data exfiltration.
    *   **Insider Threat (Medium Severity):** Identifies malicious data theft.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Early warning.
    *   **Insider Threat:** Timely intervention.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Firefly III *has* data export functionality.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No built-in detailed logging/alerting for exports. Limited granular control over export permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden Firefly III's Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_firefly_iii's_configuration_files.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy:** Review and Harden Firefly III's Configuration Files

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Configuration Files:** Find `.env` and files in `config`.
    2.  **Review Security Settings:** Check:
        *   `APP_KEY`: Strong, random key.
        *   `APP_DEBUG`: `false` in production.
        *   `SESSION_LIFETIME`: Reasonable value.
        *   Password Complexity: Enforce strong rules (if configurable in-app).
        *   API Key Settings: Review API key management.
        *   Database Settings: Strong credentials, encryption.
        *   `TRUSTED_PROXIES`: Correct if using a reverse proxy.
    3.  **Follow Documentation:** Use recommended settings.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Firefly III *uses* configuration files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No built-in tool to validate config security. A "security hardening" checklist would help.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Input](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_input.md)

**6. Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User Input

* **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Fields:** Find all places users enter data.
    2.  **Implement Input Validation:**
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Define allowed characters per field.
        *   **Reject Invalid Input:** Reject non-conforming input.
        *   **Validate Data Types:** Ensure correct data types.
    3.  **Implement Output Encoding:**

        *   **Prevent XSS:** Treat user data as data, not code.
    4.  **Use a Templating Engine:** Use a secure engine (like Twig).
    5.  **Regularly Test:** Test validation and encoding.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents script injection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Test Firefly III's Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_test_firefly_iii's_authentication_and_authorization.md)

**7. Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Test Firefly III's Authentication and Authorization

*   **Description:**
        *   This strategy requires actions *on* Firefly III, but relies on *external* tools.  Since the prompt specifies *direct* involvement, this is included, but with the caveat that the *testing* itself isn't built-in. The *vulnerabilities* being tested are within Firefly III.
    1.  **Manual Testing:** Regularly test:
        *   Log in with bad credentials.
        *   Access pages without login.
        *   Access restricted pages.
        *   Modify unauthorized data.
    2.  **Document Findings:** Record all findings.
    3.  **Remediate Vulnerabilities:** Fix identified issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass (High Severity):** Finds login bypasses.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Detects privilege escalation.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Finds data access flaws.
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Helps find injection issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Reduces bypass risk.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Reduces escalation risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Reduces data access risk.
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities:** Helps mitigate.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Firefly III has *no* built-in testing capabilities.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The project needs a formalized security testing program. Guidance for basic security checks would help users.
