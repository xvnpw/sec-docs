# Attack Surface Analysis for firefly-iii/firefly-iii

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Import Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_import_files.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Firefly III's file parsing logic for data imports (CSV, Spectre, YNAB, etc.).
*   **Firefly III Contribution:** Firefly III's *own* parsing logic for various financial data formats creates this specific attack surface. The variety of supported formats increases the potential attack area. This is entirely within Firefly III's code.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a CSV file with specially formatted data that triggers a buffer overflow in Firefly III's CSV parser, leading to arbitrary code execution. Alternatively, a crafted file could cause excessive memory allocation, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, data corruption/manipulation, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible) or High (for DoS and data manipulation).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* supported import formats. Use secure parsing libraries and avoid custom parsing logic where possible. Implement fuzz testing specifically targeting the import functionality. Enforce strict file size limits. Use memory-safe programming techniques. Perform regular code reviews focused on the import modules.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious/Unintended Rule Execution](./attack_surfaces/maliciousunintended_rule_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of Firefly III's rule-based automation system to perform unauthorized actions or cause unintended consequences.
*   **Firefly III Contribution:** The rule engine and the specific actions available *within Firefly III's code* define this attack surface. This is entirely internal to Firefly III.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a user's account and creates a rule that automatically transfers funds to an external account whenever a deposit is made (assuming Firefly III has such capabilities internally or through tightly coupled, first-party integrations). Alternatively, a user creates a complex set of rules that interact in unexpected ways, leading to data corruption or a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Financial loss (if applicable), data corruption/deletion, denial of service, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (especially if connected to financial APIs *through Firefly III's direct control*) or Medium (for data manipulation).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):** Implement strict input validation for rule creation. Limit the scope of actions that rules can perform. Provide a "sandbox" mode for testing rules. Implement logging and auditing of rule execution. Consider adding limitations or approvals for high-risk actions (e.g., large fund transfers). Regularly review and audit the rule engine's code for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [API Vulnerabilities (if API is enabled)](./attack_surfaces/api_vulnerabilities__if_api_is_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Firefly III's *own* API endpoints.
*   **Firefly III Contribution:** The specific API endpoints and their functionality, *as implemented by Firefly III*, create this attack surface. This is entirely within Firefly III's code.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an API endpoint that allows creating new users without proper authorization checks. They use this endpoint to create an administrator account and gain full control of the application. Alternatively, an endpoint for modifying rules could be exploited to inject malicious rules.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service, unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution or privilege escalation is possible) or High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):** Implement robust authentication and authorization for *all* API endpoints. Use strong API key management practices (rotation, secure storage). Implement input validation and sanitization for all API requests. Follow secure coding practices for API development (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10). Perform regular security testing of the API (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).

## Attack Surface: [Data Isolation Issues (Multi-User)](./attack_surfaces/data_isolation_issues__multi-user_.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly isolate data between users in a multi-user Firefly III deployment, *within Firefly III's code*.
*   **Firefly III Contribution:** Firefly III's *own* user management and data access control mechanisms determine the level of data isolation. This is entirely internal to Firefly III.
*   **Example:** A user discovers that they can access another user's financial data by manipulating URLs or API requests *within Firefly III*. Alternatively, a vulnerability in the user authentication system *within Firefly III* allows a user to impersonate another user.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive financial information, privacy violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developers):** Implement robust data access controls to ensure that users can only access their own data. Use unique identifiers for users and data that are not easily guessable. Regularly test and audit the data isolation mechanisms. Follow secure coding practices for multi-user applications.
