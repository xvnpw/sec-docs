Okay, let's create a design document for the Firefly III project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Firefly III is a self-hosted personal finance manager.  The primary business goal is to provide users with a reliable, private, and secure way to track their finances.  It aims to be a free and open-source alternative to commercial, cloud-based personal finance applications.  Success is measured by user adoption, community contributions, and the overall stability and security of the application.  Given its self-hosted nature, the target user base likely has a higher-than-average technical proficiency and a strong desire for data privacy.

Business Priorities:

*   Data Privacy:  Users are entrusting the application with sensitive financial data.  Maintaining the confidentiality of this data is paramount.
*   Data Integrity:  Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of financial data is critical.  Users need to trust that the application is correctly recording and calculating their finances.
*   Availability:  While self-hosted, users expect the application to be available when they need it.  Downtime or data loss can be highly disruptive.
*   Usability: The application should be user-friendly and intuitive, even for users with limited financial expertise.
*   Extensibility: The ability to import data from various sources and potentially integrate with other financial tools is a key feature.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to user financial data could lead to identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage to the project.
*   Data Corruption/Loss:  Bugs, hardware failures, or user error could lead to the loss or corruption of financial data, causing significant inconvenience and potential financial harm to users.
*   Malicious User Input:  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application through malicious input could compromise the entire system.
*   Compromised Dependencies:  Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies could be exploited to attack the application.
*   Lack of User Awareness: Users may not follow best practices for securing their self-hosted instance, leaving it vulnerable to attack.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and common practices):

*   security control: Authentication: User authentication via username/password, with support for two-factor authentication (2FA) using TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password). Implemented in application logic and described in documentation.
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Implemented in application logic.
*   security control: Input Validation: Validation of user-supplied data to prevent common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. Implemented in application logic, particularly in form handling and data processing.
*   security control: Encryption at Rest: Encouragement (but not enforcement) for users to encrypt their database and server storage. Described in documentation.
*   security control: Encryption in Transit: Encouragement (but not enforcement) for users to use HTTPS to secure communication between the client and server. Described in documentation.
*   security control: Regular Updates: The project maintainers release regular updates to address bugs and security vulnerabilities. Described in release notes and documentation.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Use of Composer for managing PHP dependencies.  This allows for easier tracking and updating of libraries. Described in `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.
*   security control: Security Headers: Some security-related HTTP headers are set, such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Frame-Options. Implemented in web server configuration and application middleware.
*   security control: Docker Image: Provision of a Docker image simplifies deployment and helps ensure a consistent environment. Described in `Dockerfile` and documentation.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Self-Hosted Responsibility: The project explicitly places the responsibility for securing the hosting environment on the user. This includes server security, network configuration, and operating system updates.
*   accepted risk: Limited Security Audits: While the project likely benefits from community scrutiny, there's no indication of regular, formal security audits.
*   accepted risk: Potential for User Misconfiguration: Users may misconfigure their instance, leaving it vulnerable to attack.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement automatic security updates or notifications within the application.
*   Provide more detailed security hardening guides for various deployment scenarios.
*   Consider integrating with security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) for automated vulnerability testing.
*   Implement rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
*   Provide options for more granular audit logging of user actions.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).
    *   Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   Secure password reset mechanism.
    *   Mandatory 2FA option.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to different features and data.
    *   Principle of least privilege: Users should only have access to the data and functionality they need.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user-supplied data, including data imported from external sources.
    *   Output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Parameterized queries or ORM usage to prevent SQL injection.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for password hashing (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).
    *   Secure generation and storage of encryption keys.
    *   If storing sensitive data at rest, use strong encryption (e.g., AES-256).

*   User Credentials:  Highly sensitive.  Includes usernames, hashed passwords, and 2FA secrets.
*   Personal Information:  Potentially sensitive.  May include user names, email addresses, and other profile information.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that need to be considered?
*   What is the expected user base size and growth rate? This can impact scalability and performance requirements.
*   What are the specific threat models or attack scenarios that the development team is most concerned about?
*   Are there any plans for integrating with specific financial institutions or APIs?
*   What level of support is provided to users for security-related issues?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: Users are aware of the inherent risks of self-hosting and are responsible for securing their own infrastructure.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies heavily on community contributions and user feedback for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
*   DESIGN: The Docker-based deployment is the recommended and most commonly used deployment method. The application is primarily accessed via a web browser over HTTPS.
