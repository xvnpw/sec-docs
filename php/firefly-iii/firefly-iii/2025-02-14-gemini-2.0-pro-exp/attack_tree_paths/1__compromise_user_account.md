# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise User Account in Firefly III

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the selected attack tree path ("Compromise User Account" via 2FA recovery code compromise and account recovery weaknesses) within the context of the Firefly III application.  This analysis aims to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and prioritize remediation efforts.  The ultimate goal is to enhance the security posture of Firefly III against account compromise attacks.

**Scope:**

*   **Application:** Firefly III (https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii) -  We will consider the application's code, configuration options, and typical deployment environments.
*   **Attack Tree Path:**
    *   1.  Compromise User Account
        *   1.1.2 Compromise of 2FA recovery codes (CRITICAL)
        *   1.3 Account Recovery Weakness (CRITICAL)
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis will *not* cover attacks that are entirely outside the application's control (e.g., operating system vulnerabilities, physical attacks on the server itself, unless they directly enable the in-scope attack vectors).  We will focus on vulnerabilities that can be addressed within the Firefly III application or its recommended configuration.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  Examine the Firefly III codebase (PHP, Laravel framework) for vulnerabilities related to:
    *   2FA recovery code generation, storage, and validation.
    *   Account recovery mechanisms (password reset, security questions, email verification).
    *   Rate limiting and other anti-brute-force measures.
    *   Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Review the default configuration files and documentation to identify potentially insecure settings related to the attack vectors.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  While we won't perform live penetration testing, we will conceptually analyze how an attacker might exploit identified vulnerabilities in a running instance of Firefly III.  This includes considering common deployment scenarios.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop realistic attack scenarios based on the identified vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable steps to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, including code changes, configuration adjustments, and user education.
6.  **Prioritization:**  Rank the mitigation recommendations based on their impact on reducing risk and the effort required to implement them.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 2.1.  Compromise of 2FA Recovery Codes (1.1.2)

**Detailed Attack Vector Analysis:**

*   **Insecure Storage:**
    *   **Code Review Focus:** Search for code that handles the display and storage of recovery codes.  Look for instances where codes might be:
        *   Stored in plain text in the database.
        *   Logged to files.
        *   Displayed in unencrypted session data.
        *   Sent via unencrypted email.
        *   Stored in browser local storage without proper protection.
    *   **Firefly III Specifics:**  Firefly III uses Laravel's built-in 2FA features.  We need to verify how Laravel, and specifically Firefly III's implementation, handles recovery code storage.  The database schema should be checked for the `users` table and any related tables that might store 2FA information.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strong Encryption:**  Recovery codes *must* be encrypted at rest in the database using a strong, industry-standard encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256 with a securely managed key).  The encryption key should *never* be stored in the codebase or alongside the encrypted data.
        *   **Secure Key Management:** Implement a robust key management system (e.g., using a dedicated key management service or hardware security module).
        *   **Avoid Logging:**  Ensure that recovery codes are *never* logged to any files or output streams.
        *   **Secure Transmission:**  If recovery codes are displayed to the user or sent via email, ensure this is done over HTTPS and consider adding additional security measures (e.g., one-time use links, short expiration times).
        *   **User Education:**  Instruct users to store their recovery codes securely (e.g., in a password manager, offline in a secure location).

*   **Predictable Generation:**
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code responsible for generating recovery codes.  Look for the use of weak random number generators (e.g., `rand()`, predictable seeds).
    *   **Firefly III Specifics:**  Laravel typically uses a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) for security-sensitive operations.  We need to confirm that Firefly III is correctly utilizing Laravel's built-in functions (e.g., `Str::random()`, `random_bytes()`) and not overriding them with weaker alternatives.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use CSPRNG:**  Ensure that a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) is used for generating recovery codes.  Leverage Laravel's built-in functions.
        *   **Sufficient Entropy:**  The CSPRNG should be seeded with sufficient entropy to ensure unpredictability.
        *   **Code Audit:**  Regularly audit the code to ensure that the CSPRNG is not inadvertently replaced or weakened.

*   **Social Engineering:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **User Education:**  Train users to recognize and avoid phishing and other social engineering attacks.  Emphasize the importance of never sharing recovery codes with anyone.
        *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Implement regular security awareness training for all users.
        *   **Phishing Simulations:**  Conduct periodic phishing simulations to test user awareness and identify areas for improvement.

*   **Physical Access:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **User Education:**  Advise users to store printed recovery codes in a physically secure location (e.g., a safe, a locked drawer).
        *   **Discourage Printing:**  Consider providing alternative secure storage options (e.g., integration with password managers) to discourage users from printing recovery codes.

### 2.2. Account Recovery Weakness (1.3)

**Detailed Attack Vector Analysis:**

*   **Predictable Security Questions:**
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code that handles security questions.  Look for:
        *   A limited set of predefined questions.
        *   Questions with easily guessable answers.
        *   Lack of input validation on answers.
    *   **Firefly III Specifics:**  Firefly III, by default, does *not* use security questions for password recovery. It relies on email-based password resets.  This is a good practice, as security questions are often weak.  However, we need to ensure that any custom implementations or plugins do not introduce this vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid Security Questions:**  Do *not* use security questions as a primary account recovery mechanism.  They are inherently vulnerable to guessing and social engineering.
        *   **If Used (Not Recommended):** If security questions *must* be used (strongly discouraged), implement the following:
            *   **Large Question Pool:**  Use a large and diverse pool of questions.
            *   **User-Defined Questions:**  Allow users to create their own questions and answers.
            *   **Strong Input Validation:**  Validate user-provided answers to prevent injection attacks and ensure they meet complexity requirements.
            *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of incorrect attempts to answer security questions.

*   **Weak Password Reset Token:**
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code that generates and validates password reset tokens.  Look for:
        *   Weak random number generators.
        *   Short token lengths.
        *   Predictable token formats.
        *   Lack of proper validation (e.g., checking for expiration, tampering).
    *   **Firefly III Specifics:**  Laravel provides built-in functionality for generating secure password reset tokens.  We need to verify that Firefly III is using this functionality correctly and not introducing any weaknesses.  The `password_resets` table in the database should be examined.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Use CSPRNG:**  Generate password reset tokens using a CSPRNG.
        *   **Sufficient Length and Complexity:**  Tokens should be sufficiently long and complex to prevent brute-force attacks (e.g., at least 32 random characters).
        *   **Proper Validation:**  Implement robust validation of tokens, including:
            *   **Expiration:**  Tokens should expire after a short period (e.g., 1 hour).
            *   **One-Time Use:**  Tokens should be invalidated after a single use.
            *   **Tamper Resistance:**  Use a cryptographic hash or digital signature to ensure that tokens have not been tampered with.
        *   **Store Token Hashes:** Store only the *hash* of the token in the database, not the token itself. This prevents an attacker from using stolen database contents to reset passwords.

*   **Email Compromise:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strong Email Security:**  This is largely outside the direct control of Firefly III, but users should be strongly encouraged to use strong passwords and 2FA for their email accounts.
        *   **Short Token Expiration:**  Shorten the expiration time of password reset tokens to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker who has compromised an email account.
        *   **Notification of Password Reset:**  Send a notification to the user's *original* email address whenever a password reset is requested, even if the request is successful. This allows the user to detect unauthorized password resets.
        *   **Consider Alternative Recovery Methods:** Explore alternative account recovery methods that do not rely solely on email (e.g., SMS verification, authenticator apps), but carefully weigh the security implications of each method.

*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code that handles password reset requests.  Look for:
        *   Absence of rate limiting mechanisms.
        *   Ineffective rate limiting (e.g., based only on IP address, easily bypassed).
    *   **Firefly III Specifics:**  Laravel includes built-in rate limiting middleware.  We need to confirm that Firefly III is applying this middleware to the password reset routes.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Implement robust rate limiting on password reset requests.  This should limit the number of requests from a single IP address, user account, or other identifier within a given time period.
        *   **Progressive Delays:**  Introduce progressively longer delays after multiple failed attempts.
        *   **CAPTCHA:**  Consider using a CAPTCHA to further deter automated attacks.
        *   **Account Lockout:**  After a certain number of failed attempts, temporarily lock the account and require manual intervention (e.g., contacting support) to unlock it.
