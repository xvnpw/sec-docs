## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise User Account](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_user_account.md)

*   **1.1.2 Compromise of 2FA recovery codes (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to a user's 2FA recovery codes, allowing them to bypass two-factor authentication and log in as the user.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Insecure Storage:** Recovery codes are stored in a plain text file, email, or other easily accessible location.
        *   **Predictable Generation:**  The recovery codes are generated using a weak algorithm, making them guessable.
        *   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker tricks the user into revealing their recovery codes (e.g., phishing, pretexting).
        *   **Physical Access:** The attacker gains physical access to a device where the recovery codes are stored (e.g., printed copy, phone).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **1.3 Account Recovery Weakness (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in the account recovery process to reset a user's password and gain access to their account.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Predictable Security Questions:**  The security questions are easily guessable (e.g., "What is your mother's maiden name?").
        *   **Weak Password Reset Token:** The password reset token is generated using a weak algorithm or is not properly validated.
        *   **Email Compromise:**  The attacker gains access to the user's email account and uses it to initiate a password reset.
        *   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  The attacker can make numerous password reset attempts without being blocked.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (aggregate of sub-vectors)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on the specific weakness)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (from Very Hard to Easy)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Application Logic Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_application_logic_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Import/Export Functionality [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **2.1.1 Malicious file upload via import (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., CSV, OFX, Spectre) that, when processed by Firefly III, leads to code execution on the server.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **2.1.1.1 Insufficient validation of file content (CRITICAL):** The application does not properly validate the *content* of the uploaded file, allowing executable code or malicious scripts to be embedded within seemingly harmless file types (e.g., a CSV file containing PHP code).
            *   **Path Traversal:** The attacker crafts a filename that allows them to write the uploaded file to an arbitrary location on the server (e.g., overwriting critical system files).
            *   **Exploiting Parsing Libraries:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the libraries used to parse the imported files (e.g., a buffer overflow in a CSV parser).
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **2.5 Webhooks [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **2.5.2 Lack of Signature Verification (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** Firefly III does not verify the authenticity of incoming webhook requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests and potentially manipulate data or trigger unintended actions.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Forged Requests:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP requests that mimic legitimate webhook requests from services like GitHub, payment processors, etc.
            *   **Replay Attacks:** The attacker intercepts a legitimate webhook request and resends it multiple times.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (Specific to Firefly III's Dependencies) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities__specific_to_firefly_iii's_dependencies___high_risk_.md)

*   **3.1 Vulnerabilities in Laravel Framework (or its components) [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **3.1.1 Known CVEs in the specific Laravel version used (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in the specific version of the Laravel framework used by Firefly III.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**  Exploitation depends on the specific CVE.  Common vulnerabilities include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), and authentication bypass.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low (if a public exploit exists) / High (if it's a 0-day)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (if a public exploit exists) / Expert (if it's a 0-day)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if a public exploit exists) / Very Hard (if it's a 0-day)

    *   **3.1.2 Misconfiguration of Laravel environment (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:**  The Laravel environment is misconfigured, exposing sensitive information or creating vulnerabilities.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Debug Mode Enabled:**  The application is running in debug mode in a production environment, exposing detailed error messages and potentially sensitive information.
            *   **Insecure .env File:**  The `.env` file (containing sensitive configuration data) is accessible from the web.
            *   **Weak Application Key:**  The application key (used for encryption) is weak or has been leaked.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

*   **3.2 Vulnerabilities in other PHP dependencies [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **3.2.1 Known CVEs in libraries used for CSV parsing, date handling, etc. (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in a PHP library used by Firefly III (e.g., a library for parsing CSV files, handling dates, or interacting with the database).
        *   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation depends on the specific CVE. Common vulnerabilities are similar to those in Laravel (SQLi, XSS, RCE).
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low (if a public exploit exists) / High (if it's a 0-day)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (if a public exploit exists) / Expert (if it's a 0-day)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if a public exploit exists) / Very Hard (if it's a 0-day)
