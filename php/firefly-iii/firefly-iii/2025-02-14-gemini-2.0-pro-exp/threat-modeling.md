# Threat Model Analysis for firefly-iii/firefly-iii

## Threat: [Malicious Data Import (Spoofing)](./threats/malicious_data_import__spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Import (Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious CSV, OFX, QIF, or Spectre/Bunq API import file containing fabricated transactions, manipulated balances, or specially crafted data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic. The attacker then tricks a legitimate user into importing this file, or gains access to the system and imports it directly.  The vulnerability lies within Firefly III's parsing and validation of these specific financial file formats.
    *   **Impact:** Corruption of financial data, leading to incorrect balances, false reporting, and potentially financial losses if decisions are made based on the corrupted data. The attacker could also potentially gain insights into the user's financial habits.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ImportController`, data import parsers (CSV, OFX, QIF, Spectre/Bunq API clients), database transaction handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* fields in *all* supported import formats.  Use well-vetted, dedicated parsing libraries for each format (e.g., a robust OFX parser).  Implement checksum verification where supported by the format.  Thoroughly test the import process with a wide range of valid and *invalid* input files, including edge cases and deliberately malformed data.  Implement a "preview" feature showing the parsed data *before* committing it to the database.  Add rate limiting to import operations.

## Threat: [API Connection Spoofing (Spoofing)](./threats/api_connection_spoofing__spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** API Connection Spoofing (Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between Firefly III and a connected financial institution's API (e.g., Spectre, Nordigen, Salt Edge).  This could involve a man-in-the-middle attack, DNS spoofing, or compromising a proxy server. The attacker presents a fake API endpoint to Firefly III, or modifies requests and responses in transit, potentially injecting false data or stealing credentials. This threat is critical because Firefly III *initiates* and *manages* these connections.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive financial data to the attacker.  Injection of false transaction data into Firefly III.  Potential compromise of the user's account at the connected financial institution.
    *   **Affected Component:** API client libraries (Spectre, Nordigen, Salt Edge integrations), network communication layer, OAuth 2.0 handling (if used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Enforce HTTPS with strict certificate validation (including certificate pinning, if feasible).  Implement robust authentication and authorization for API connections, following best practices for OAuth 2.0 or the relevant protocol.  Regularly update API client libraries to address security vulnerabilities.  Implement integrity checks on data received from APIs (e.g., using digital signatures, if supported).  Log all API communication securely.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering (Tampering)](./threats/configuration_file_tampering__tampering_.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration File Tampering (Tampering) *[If Firefly III handles the configuration loading/parsing]*

    *   **Description:**  Assuming Firefly III has logic to *read and interpret* configuration files (like `.env`), an attacker who gains access to these files could modify them.  If Firefly III doesn't *validate* the contents of these files properly, the attacker could inject malicious settings, redirect database connections, or alter API keys.  This is *critical* if Firefly III itself is responsible for parsing and applying these settings.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Firefly III instance. Data loss, data theft, unauthorized access to connected financial accounts, and potential for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and parsing logic within Firefly III (e.g., functions that read and process `.env` or other configuration files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict validation of *all* configuration settings loaded from files.  Ensure that values are within expected ranges and of the correct data types.  Consider using a dedicated configuration management library with built-in security features.  Provide clear documentation on secure configuration practices.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Messages (Information Disclosure)](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_error_messages__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Error Messages (Information Disclosure)

    *   **Description:** Firefly III encounters an error (e.g., a database connection error, an invalid input) and, due to a flaw in *its* error handling, displays an error message to the user that inadvertently reveals sensitive information, such as account balances, transaction details, API keys, or database credentials. This is a direct threat to Firefly III's code.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive financial data to unauthorized users.  Potential for attackers to use the disclosed information to launch further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Error handling logic throughout the application, exception handling, logging mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Disable debug mode in production environments.  Implement custom error handling to prevent the display of *any* sensitive information in error messages shown to users.  Log detailed error information (including sensitive data, if necessary) to a secure log file, *not* to the user interface.  Regularly review and sanitize error messages and debug output.  Use generic error messages for users (e.g., "An error occurred. Please try again later.").

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Third-Party APIs (Information Disclosure)](./threats/data_leakage_via_third-party_apis__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage via Third-Party APIs (Information Disclosure) *[Focus on Firefly III's handling of API data]*

    *   **Description:** While the primary vulnerability might be in the third-party API, Firefly III's *handling* of the data received from these APIs can exacerbate the risk.  If Firefly III doesn't properly validate or sanitize data received from APIs, or if it stores this data insecurely, it can contribute to data leakage. This focuses on *Firefly III's responsibility* in the data flow.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive financial data to unauthorized parties, even if the initial breach occurs at the third-party API.
    *   **Affected Component:** API client libraries (Spectre, Nordigen, Salt Edge integrations), data storage mechanisms for data retrieved from APIs, data validation and sanitization routines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strong input validation and sanitization for *all* data received from third-party APIs, treating it as untrusted input.  Store API data securely, following best practices for data encryption and access control.  Implement data minimization – only store the minimum necessary data from APIs.

## Threat: [RBAC Bypass (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/rbac_bypass__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Threat:** RBAC Bypass (Elevation of Privilege)

    *   **Description:** A flaw in Firefly III's *own* role-based access control (RBAC) implementation allows a user with limited privileges to access data or functionality that they should not have. This is entirely within Firefly III's code and control.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive financial data.  Unauthorized modification or deletion of data.  Potential for further privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:**  User authentication and authorization logic, middleware that enforces access control, controllers and models that handle sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Thoroughly test and audit the RBAC implementation to ensure that it enforces the intended access restrictions.  Follow the principle of least privilege – grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.  Regularly review and update user roles and permissions.  Use a well-established and tested RBAC library or framework (e.g., Laravel's built-in authorization features).  Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify RBAC functionality.
