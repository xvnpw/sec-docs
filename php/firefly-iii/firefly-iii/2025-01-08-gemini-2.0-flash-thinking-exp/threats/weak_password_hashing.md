**Subject:** Deep Analysis of "Weak Password Hashing" Threat in Firefly III

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the "Weak Password Hashing" threat identified in the threat model for Firefly III. We will delve into the technical details, potential impact, and provide actionable recommendations for mitigation.

**1. Reiteration of the Threat:**

As stated in the threat model:

> **THREAT:** Weak Password Hashing
>
> *   **Description:** If Firefly III uses outdated or weak password hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA1 without sufficient salting), an attacker who gains unauthorized access to the application's database can more easily crack user passwords. This allows the attacker to impersonate users and access their financial data.
>    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, full access to user's financial records within Firefly III, potential manipulation or deletion of data.
>    *   **Affected Component:** User authentication module, specifically the password hashing function.
>    *   **Risk Severity:** High
>    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
>        *   Developers must implement strong and modern password hashing algorithms like Argon2 or bcrypt with a high cost factor and unique salts for each password.
>        *   Regularly review and update the password hashing implementation to adhere to current security best practices.

**2. Technical Deep Dive:**

The core of this threat lies in the cryptographic strength of the password hashing algorithm used. When a user creates an account or changes their password, the application should not store the password in plain text. Instead, it should apply a one-way function (a hash function) to the password, resulting in a fixed-size string of characters (the hash). This hash is then stored in the database.

**Why Weak Hashing is a Problem:**

* **Reversibility (to a degree):**  While hash functions are designed to be one-way, older or weaker algorithms have vulnerabilities that make it easier to reverse the process, especially with the aid of pre-computed tables (rainbow tables) or brute-force attacks.
* **Lack of Salt:** A "salt" is a randomly generated, unique piece of data added to each password before hashing. Without unique salts, users with the same password will have the same hash, making it easier for attackers to crack multiple accounts at once if they crack one.
* **Low Computational Cost:**  Weak hashing algorithms are often computationally inexpensive to calculate. This makes brute-force attacks much faster and more feasible for attackers with sufficient computing resources.

**Examples of Weak/Outdated Algorithms:**

* **MD5:**  Considered cryptographically broken and should never be used for password hashing.
* **SHA-1:**  While once considered secure, it's now vulnerable to collision attacks and is not recommended for password hashing.
* **SHA-256/SHA-512 without sufficient salting and iteration:** While stronger than MD5 and SHA-1, simply using these algorithms without proper salting and a sufficient number of iterations (cost factor) can still leave them vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

**Examples of Strong/Modern Algorithms:**

* **bcrypt:** A widely respected and well-vetted algorithm that includes built-in salting and a work factor (number of iterations) that can be adjusted to increase computational cost.
* **Argon2:**  A modern key derivation function that won the Password Hashing Competition. It offers resistance against both CPU and GPU-based attacks and has different variants (Argon2i, Argon2d, Argon2id) to suit various use cases. **Argon2id is generally recommended for password hashing.**
* **scrypt:** Another strong key derivation function that is memory-hard, making it more resistant to attacks using specialized hardware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

If an attacker gains access to the Firefly III database (e.g., through an SQL injection vulnerability or compromised server), and weak password hashing is in place, they can:

1. **Extract the password hashes.**
2. **Attempt to crack these hashes offline** using various techniques:
    * **Rainbow Tables:** Pre-computed tables of hashes for common passwords.
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Trying all possible password combinations.
    * **Dictionary Attacks:** Trying common words and phrases.
    * **GPU-Accelerated Cracking:** Leveraging the parallel processing power of GPUs to speed up the cracking process.
3. **Once a password is cracked, the attacker can log in as the legitimate user.**
4. **Gain full access to the user's financial data:** This includes account balances, transaction history, budgets, and other sensitive information.
5. **Manipulate or delete data:** The attacker could alter financial records, transfer funds (if such functionality exists or can be indirectly manipulated), or delete accounts.
6. **Impersonate the user:**  The attacker could use the compromised account to perform actions as if they were the legitimate user, potentially causing further damage or fraud.

**3. Detailed Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively address this threat, the following steps are crucial:

* **Implement Argon2id:**  Migrate the password hashing implementation to the Argon2id algorithm. This provides a strong defense against various cracking techniques.
    * **Rationale:** Argon2id offers a good balance of security and performance and is resistant to both CPU and GPU-based attacks.
    * **Implementation Details:** Utilize a well-vetted and actively maintained library for Argon2id implementation in the application's programming language. Ensure proper handling of salts and cost factors.
* **Use Strong, Unique Salts:**  Generate a unique, cryptographically secure random salt for each user's password. This salt should be stored alongside the password hash in the database.
    * **Rationale:** Salts prevent attackers from using pre-computed rainbow tables to crack multiple passwords simultaneously.
    * **Implementation Details:** Leverage secure random number generators provided by the programming language or cryptographic libraries. Ensure salts are long enough (at least 16 bytes) to be effective.
* **Configure a High Cost Factor (Work Factor/Iterations):**  Set the cost factor (number of iterations or memory usage) for the chosen hashing algorithm to a sufficiently high value. This increases the computational effort required to hash and verify passwords, making brute-force attacks significantly more time-consuming and expensive for attackers.
    * **Rationale:**  A higher cost factor makes password cracking more difficult, even with powerful hardware.
    * **Implementation Details:**  The appropriate cost factor should be balanced against the performance impact on user authentication. Regularly re-evaluate the cost factor based on advancements in computing power. Start with recommended values for Argon2id and adjust based on performance testing.
* **Secure Storage of Hashes and Salts:** Ensure the database storing password hashes and salts is properly secured to prevent unauthorized access. This includes:
    * **Access Controls:** Restricting access to the database to only authorized personnel and applications.
    * **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypting the database at rest to protect data even if the storage media is compromised.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conducting regular security audits of the database infrastructure.
* **Password Reset and Migration Strategy:**  Develop a secure and well-planned strategy for migrating existing user passwords to the new hashing algorithm. This might involve:
    * **Forced Password Reset:**  Requiring users to reset their passwords upon the next login. This is the most secure approach but can be disruptive to users.
    * **Lazy Migration:**  Re-hashing passwords with the new algorithm when users log in. This is less disruptive but leaves older hashes vulnerable until the user logs in.
    * **Batch Migration:**  Migrating passwords in batches during off-peak hours. This requires careful planning and execution.
* **Regularly Review and Update:**  Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating the password hashing implementation to keep up with evolving security best practices and address any newly discovered vulnerabilities in existing algorithms.

**4. Verification Methods:**

To ensure the implemented mitigation strategies are effective, the following verification methods should be employed:

* **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code implementing the password hashing functionality to ensure proper use of the chosen algorithm, salt generation, and cost factor configuration.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing specifically targeting the authentication mechanism. This will simulate real-world attacks and identify any weaknesses in the implementation.
* **Password Cracking Audits:**  Perform internal password cracking audits against a copy of the user database (in a controlled environment). This will help assess the strength of the implemented hashing and identify if the cost factor is sufficient.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities related to password hashing and other security flaws.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to test the running application and identify vulnerabilities that may not be apparent in the static code analysis.

**5. Preventative Measures:**

Beyond mitigating the immediate threat, consider these preventative measures:

* **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle, including design, coding, testing, and deployment.
* **Security Training for Developers:** Provide regular security training to developers to educate them on secure coding practices, including proper password handling techniques.
* **Dependency Management:**  Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.

**6. Conclusion:**

Implementing strong password hashing is a critical security measure for protecting user accounts and sensitive financial data within Firefly III. Migrating to a modern algorithm like Argon2id with proper salting and a high cost factor is essential. This requires a collaborative effort between the development and security teams, along with a commitment to ongoing monitoring and updates.
