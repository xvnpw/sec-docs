# Threat Model Analysis for firefly-iii/firefly-iii

## Threat: [Weak Password Hashing](./threats/weak_password_hashing.md)

*   **Description:** If Firefly III uses outdated or weak password hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA1 without sufficient salting), an attacker who gains unauthorized access to the application's database can more easily crack user passwords. This allows the attacker to impersonate users and access their financial data.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, full access to user's financial records within Firefly III, potential manipulation or deletion of data.
    *   **Affected Component:** User authentication module, specifically the password hashing function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers must implement strong and modern password hashing algorithms like Argon2 or bcrypt with a high cost factor and unique salts for each password.
        *   Regularly review and update the password hashing implementation to adhere to current security best practices.

## Threat: [Insufficient Rate Limiting on Login Attempts](./threats/insufficient_rate_limiting_on_login_attempts.md)

*   **Description:** Firefly III lacks adequate rate limiting on login attempts. An attacker can exploit this by performing a brute-force attack, systematically trying numerous password combinations until they successfully guess a user's credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user's financial data.
    *   **Affected Component:** User authentication module, specifically the login form and authentication logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts, temporarily locking out accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts from the same IP address or user account.
        *   Consider implementing CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to differentiate between human users and automated attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure "Remember Me" Functionality](./threats/insecure_remember_me_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** The "remember me" feature in Firefly III is implemented insecurely. For example, it might store easily guessable or predictable tokens in cookies without proper encryption or validation. An attacker who gains access to a user's browser or computer could reuse these tokens to gain persistent access to the user's account without needing to provide credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Persistent account takeover, unauthorized access to financial data even after the user has logged out.
    *   **Affected Component:** Session management module, specifically the "remember me" feature implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure, randomly generated, and long tokens for the "remember me" functionality.
        *   Hash the token stored in the database and compare against the hashed token in the cookie.
        *   Implement token rotation and expiration for "remember me" tokens.
        *   Offer users the ability to revoke "remember me" sessions.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Execution via Vulnerable Extension](./threats/malicious_code_execution_via_vulnerable_extension.md)

*   **Description:** Firefly III's extension system allows for the installation of third-party extensions. If the application does not properly sanitize or validate extensions, a malicious extension could be developed or a legitimate extension could be compromised to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Firefly III or within the user's browser when interacting with the application.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Firefly III installation, including access to all financial data, potential server takeover, and the ability to inject malicious content into the user interface.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extension management module, extension API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a strict review process for all extensions before they are made available for installation.
        *   Enforce a secure coding standard for extension development.
        *   Implement sandboxing or isolation techniques for extensions to limit their access to system resources and data.
        *   Provide users with clear warnings about the risks associated with installing third-party extensions.
        *   Regularly audit the code of popular and official extensions.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of API Keys for Integrations](./threats/insecure_handling_of_api_keys_for_integrations.md)

*   **Description:** Firefly III integrates with external services using API keys or other authentication credentials. If these keys are stored insecurely within the application (e.g., in plain text in configuration files or the database without encryption), an attacker who gains access to the server or database can steal these keys. This allows the attacker to access the external services on behalf of the user, potentially leading to data breaches or financial loss on those platforms.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services connected to Firefly III, potential data breaches on those external platforms, financial loss if the integrated service involves financial transactions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Integration modules, configuration management, database storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys and other sensitive credentials securely using encryption at rest (e.g., using a dedicated secrets management system or encryption libraries).
        *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in configuration files.
        *   Consider using more secure authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 where applicable.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Firefly III relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, particularly remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, and the Firefly III developers do not promptly update these dependencies, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Firefly III.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Firefly III installation, including access to all financial data, potential server takeover, and the ability to disrupt service.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components relying on vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE vulnerabilities are present in dependencies) / High (for other significant vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust dependency management process, regularly monitoring for and updating to the latest secure versions of all third-party libraries and frameworks.
        *   Use automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   Have a plan in place to quickly patch or mitigate vulnerabilities in dependencies when they are discovered.
