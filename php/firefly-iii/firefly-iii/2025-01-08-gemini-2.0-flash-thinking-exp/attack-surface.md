# Attack Surface Analysis for firefly-iii/firefly-iii

## Attack Surface: [Malicious CSV Import](./attack_surfaces/malicious_csv_import.md)

*   **How Firefly III Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Firefly III's functionality to import financial data from CSV files introduces the risk of processing malicious content embedded within these files.
    *   **Example:** A user imports a CSV file containing a formula in a transaction description field that, when processed by the application, executes arbitrary code on the server or client-side (e.g., through spreadsheet software integration).
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (if server-side), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to session hijacking or data theft (if client-side), Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading extremely large or complex files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side sanitization and validation of all data within the CSV file before processing. Avoid direct execution of formulas or interpreting special characters in a dangerous way. Consider using dedicated CSV parsing libraries with security best practices. Implement file size limits and rate limiting for imports.
        *   **Users:** Only import CSV files from trusted sources. Be cautious about opening exported CSV files in spreadsheet software without reviewing their content first.

## Attack Surface: [Rule Engine Abuse](./attack_surfaces/rule_engine_abuse.md)

*   **How Firefly III Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The rule engine allows users to automate actions based on specific criteria. If not carefully designed and validated, malicious or poorly configured rules can lead to unintended consequences.
    *   **Example:** A user creates a rule that, under specific conditions, transfers a significant amount of money to an attacker-controlled "dummy" account. Or a rule that performs an excessive number of actions, leading to a DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss, data manipulation, Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of rule parameters and actions. Implement safeguards to prevent infinite loops or excessive resource consumption by rules. Consider implementing a review process for newly created or modified rules, especially for administrative users. Provide clear documentation and warnings about the potential impact of rules.
        *   **Users:** Carefully review the logic of any rules you create or enable. Understand the potential consequences of rule actions. Be cautious about importing or enabling rules from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [API Parameter Tampering](./attack_surfaces/api_parameter_tampering.md)

*   **How Firefly III Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The application exposes an API for programmatic access to its functionalities. If API endpoints do not properly validate input parameters, attackers can manipulate them to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `account_id` parameter in an API request to transfer funds from an account they don't own to their own account. Or they manipulate parameters to access or modify data belonging to other users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, data modification, financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong server-side validation and authorization checks for all API endpoints. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access. Implement rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about sharing API keys or tokens. Understand the permissions associated with your API credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization__if_applicable_.md)

*   **How Firefly III Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If Firefly III uses deserialization of user-controlled data (e.g., in session management or data handling), vulnerabilities can arise if the deserialization process is not secured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible. If deserialization is necessary, use secure serialization formats and libraries. Implement integrity checks (e.g., using HMAC) to ensure the serialized data has not been tampered with. Isolate deserialization processes in sandboxed environments.
        *   **Users:** This is primarily a developer concern.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/template_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **How Firefly III Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious code that gets executed on the server-side or client-side.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious code into a transaction memo field that, when rendered in a report or on the user interface, executes arbitrary code on the server or in another user's browser (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (server-side), Cross-Site Scripting (client-side).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use a templating engine that automatically escapes user-provided data by default. If raw output is necessary, implement strict sanitization and validation of user input before rendering it in templates. Follow the principle of least privilege when granting template rendering capabilities.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about the content you enter into fields that might be rendered in various parts of the application.

## Attack Surface: [Database Query Vulnerabilities (beyond simple SQL Injection)](./attack_surfaces/database_query_vulnerabilities__beyond_simple_sql_injection_.md)

*   **How Firefly III Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Even with parameterized queries, vulnerabilities can arise from complex database interactions or if the application logic constructs queries in an unsafe manner.
    *   **Example:**  A vulnerability in how the application handles search queries allows an attacker to craft a query that bypasses intended access controls and retrieves sensitive data from other users. Or a poorly constructed query leads to excessive resource consumption on the database server (DoS).
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, information disclosure, Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Perform thorough code reviews of all database interaction logic. Use database access control mechanisms effectively. Employ static analysis tools to identify potential query vulnerabilities. Regularly audit database queries for performance and security. Follow the principle of least privilege for database access.
        *   **Users:** This is primarily a developer concern.
