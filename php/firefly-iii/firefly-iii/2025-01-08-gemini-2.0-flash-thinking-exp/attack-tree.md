## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Firefly III API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_firefly_iii_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* **High-Risk Path:** Exploiting Unauthenticated/Weakly Authenticated API Endpoints
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify API endpoints that lack proper authentication or use weak authentication mechanisms.
    * **Impact:** Direct access and modification of financial data, bypassing application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploiting Input Validation Vulnerabilities in API Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_api_parameters.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious payloads into API parameters to exploit vulnerabilities like SQL Injection.
    * **Impact:** Exfiltration of sensitive data, modification of financial records, potentially remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: SQL Injection via API Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_sql_injection_via_api_parameters.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious SQL queries within API parameters.
    * **Impact:**  Direct access to the database, allowing exfiltration of sensitive information and manipulation of financial records.
        * **High-Risk Path:** Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from Firefly III Database
            * **Attack Vector:** Successful SQL injection allows attackers to retrieve sensitive data.
            * **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of financial information.
        * **High-Risk Path:** Modify Financial Records within Firefly III
            * **Attack Vector:** Successful SQL injection allows attackers to alter financial transactions, balances, etc.
            * **Impact:** Financial loss, data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Gain Remote Code Execution on Firefly III Server (via API)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_gain_remote_code_execution_on_firefly_iii_server__via_api_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit command injection vulnerabilities in API parameters.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over the Firefly III server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Insecure API Key Management](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_insecure_api_key_management.md)

* **High-Risk Path:** Steal API Keys Used by the Application
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the storage or transmission of API keys used by the application to interact with Firefly III.
            * **Impact:** Ability to impersonate the application and perform unauthorized actions.
                * **High-Risk Path:** Impersonate the Application to Access/Modify Data
                    * **Attack Vector:** Using stolen API keys, attackers make API calls as if they were the legitimate application.
                    * **Impact:** Full access to modify and retrieve data within Firefly III.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Firefly III's Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_firefly_iii's_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **High-Risk Path:** Achieve Remote Code Execution on Firefly III Server (via Dependencies)
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries used by Firefly III.
        * **Impact:** Complete control over the Firefly III server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure File Handling or Upload Functionality for Remote Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_insecure_file_handling_or_upload_functionality_for_remote_code_execution.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) to the Firefly III server through a vulnerable file upload mechanism.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over the Firefly III server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Firefly III's Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_firefly_iii's_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses.md)

* **High-Risk Path:** Gain Unauthorized Access to Firefly III Admin Panel
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers bypass authentication mechanisms or exploit vulnerabilities in the login process.
        * **Impact:** Full administrative control over the Firefly III instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Firefly III's Background Processes or Scheduled Tasks for Remote Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_firefly_iii's_background_processes_or_scheduled_tasks_for__95a189a1.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities in cron jobs or other background processes, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Complete control over the Firefly III server.
