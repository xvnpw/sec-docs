# Attack Surface Analysis for firefly-iii/firefly-iii

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Firefly III Contribution:** Firefly III handles user-provided data in various fields like transaction descriptions, account names, and category names. If these inputs are not properly sanitized before being displayed in the user interface, malicious scripts can be injected.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects JavaScript code into a transaction description. When another user views this transaction, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or defacing the application.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application, phishing attacks targeting users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Implement robust input sanitization on all user-provided data before displaying it in the UI. Utilize output encoding appropriate for the context (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content). Leverage Laravel's Blade templating engine's automatic escaping features correctly and consistently.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS even if it occurs.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews specifically focusing on user input handling and output rendering to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities within Firefly III's codebase.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (SQLi)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__sqli_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious SQL queries into database interactions, potentially allowing attackers to bypass security measures, access, modify, or delete data.
*   **Firefly III Contribution:** While Laravel's Eloquent ORM is used, Firefly III's custom features, reports, or modifications might introduce raw SQL queries or poorly constructed Eloquent queries that are vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input in a search field within a custom report feature in Firefly III. If this input is directly incorporated into a raw SQL query without proper sanitization, it could allow the attacker to bypass authentication, extract sensitive financial data, or even drop database tables.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, complete compromise of the application and underlying database containing sensitive financial information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/ORM:**  Strictly adhere to using Laravel's Eloquent ORM for all database interactions within Firefly III's custom code. Avoid raw SQL queries unless absolutely necessary. If raw SQL is unavoidable, ensure meticulous parameterization and input validation.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs that are used in database queries, even when using an ORM, especially in custom features or modifications to Firefly III.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant database users used by Firefly III only the minimum necessary permissions required for application functionality, limiting the potential damage from a successful SQL injection attack.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of all database interaction code within Firefly III, paying close attention to custom queries and areas where user input influences database queries.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing resources (files, database records, API endpoints) directly by predictable identifiers without proper authorization checks.
*   **Firefly III Contribution:** Firefly III manages sensitive financial data organized into accounts, transactions, budgets, etc., often accessed via IDs in URLs or API endpoints. Vulnerabilities in Firefly III's authorization logic when accessing these resources by ID could lead to IDOR.
*   **Example:** A user can access transaction details by navigating to `/transactions/{transaction_id}`. If Firefly III's authorization checks are insufficient, an attacker could manipulate the `transaction_id` to access and view transactions belonging to other users or accounts they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive financial data, data breaches, potential data manipulation or exfiltration of financial records.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authorization Checks:** Implement robust and consistent authorization checks in all controllers, API endpoints, and data access layers within Firefly III. Verify that the currently logged-in user has the necessary permissions to access *each specific* requested resource based on their role, ownership, and organizational access controls.
    *   **Non-Predictable IDs (UUIDs):** Consider using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) instead of sequential integer IDs for sensitive resources like accounts and transactions within Firefly III to make IDOR attacks significantly more difficult by making resource IDs unpredictable.
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement fine-grained access control lists within Firefly III to manage permissions for different users and roles, ensuring users can only access and modify data they are explicitly authorized to view and modify based on business logic and data ownership.
