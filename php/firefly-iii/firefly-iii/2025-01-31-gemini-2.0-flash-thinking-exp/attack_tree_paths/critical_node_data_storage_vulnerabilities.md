## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Insecure Database Configuration in Firefly III

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Insecure Database Configuration" attack path within the "Data Storage Vulnerabilities" section of the attack tree for Firefly III. This analysis aims to understand the potential risks associated with this path and recommend mitigation strategies to enhance the security of Firefly III deployments.

### 1. Define Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Insecure Database Configuration" attack path, specifically focusing on "Weak database passwords" and "Publicly accessible database server" nodes.  We aim to:

* **Understand the attack vectors:** Detail how an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities.
* **Assess the potential impact:**  Determine the consequences of a successful attack.
* **Identify mitigation strategies:**  Propose actionable security measures to prevent or reduce the likelihood and impact of these attacks.
* **Provide actionable recommendations:** Offer practical advice for development and deployment teams to secure Firefly III database configurations.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is scoped to the following specific path within the attack tree:

* **CRITICAL NODE:** Data Storage Vulnerabilities
    * **HIGH RISK PATH: Insecure Database Configuration**

2. **Impact Assessment:** We will analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, focusing on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within Firefly III.
3. **Likelihood Evaluation:** We will assess the likelihood of these vulnerabilities being exploited in real-world scenarios, considering common misconfigurations and attacker motivations.
4. **Mitigation Strategy Development:** We will propose specific and actionable mitigation strategies for each HIGH RISK NODE, categorized into preventative and detective controls where applicable.
5. **Best Practice Recommendations:** We will summarize general database security best practices relevant to Firefly III deployments to provide a holistic security perspective.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. HIGH RISK NODE: Weak database passwords

* **Attack Vector: Attempt to guess or brute-force weak passwords used for database accounts. Default database credentials or easily guessable passwords are common targets.**

    * **Detailed Attack Vector Description:**
        * **Password Guessing:** Attackers may attempt to guess common passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", "admin") or passwords related to the application name (e.g., "firefly", "fireflyiii"). They might also use information gathered from publicly available data breaches to try passwords that users commonly reuse.
        * **Brute-Force Attack:** Attackers can use automated tools to systematically try a large number of password combinations against the database server's authentication mechanism. This can be done online (directly against the database server) or offline (if a password hash is somehow obtained, although less likely in this scenario).
        * **Default Credentials:**  If the database is installed using default settings and the default administrative credentials are not changed (e.g., `root` with no password or a well-known default password), attackers can immediately gain access.
        * **Credential Stuffing:** If users reuse passwords across multiple services and one of those services is compromised, attackers might use the leaked credentials to attempt login to the Firefly III database.

    * **Impact:** **Full database access, allowing direct retrieval, modification, or deletion of all financial data.**

        * **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can access all financial data stored in the database, including transaction details, account balances, personal information, and potentially API keys or other sensitive configurations stored within the database.
        * **Integrity Compromise:** Attackers can modify financial data, leading to inaccurate records, fraudulent transactions, and loss of trust in the application. They could manipulate balances, alter transaction history, or even inject malicious data.
        * **Availability Disruption:** While less direct, attackers with database access could potentially disrupt the availability of Firefly III by deleting data, corrupting the database, or performing denial-of-service attacks from within the database server.
        * **Reputational Damage:** A data breach due to weak database passwords can severely damage the reputation of the user or organization using Firefly III, leading to loss of trust and potential legal repercussions depending on data privacy regulations.

    * **Likelihood Assessment:** **HIGH.** Weak passwords are a consistently exploited vulnerability. Default credentials are notoriously easy to exploit, and users often choose weak or easily guessable passwords. Brute-force attacks are relatively simple to execute, especially if there are no rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms in place at the database level (though this is less common for direct database access).

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**

        * **Preventative Controls:**
            * **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:**
                * **Mandatory Password Complexity:** Enforce strong password requirements during database user creation and password changes (minimum length, character types, etc.).
                * **Password Strength Meter:** Integrate a password strength meter during password setup to guide users towards stronger passwords.
                * **Regular Password Rotation:** Encourage or enforce regular password changes for database accounts (though less critical for service accounts if properly managed).
            * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Create database users with only the necessary privileges required for Firefly III to function. Avoid granting excessive permissions like `SUPERUSER` or `GRANT OPTION` to the application user.
            * **Disable Default Accounts:**  Disable or rename default database accounts (like `root` in MySQL/MariaDB or `postgres` in PostgreSQL) and create dedicated administrative accounts with strong passwords.
            * **Secure Credential Management:**
                * **Configuration Management:** Store database credentials securely in configuration files, ideally outside the web server's document root and with restricted file permissions.
                * **Environment Variables:** Utilize environment variables to pass database credentials to the application, avoiding hardcoding them in configuration files.
                * **Secrets Management Systems:** For more complex deployments, consider using secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to securely store and manage database credentials.

        * **Detective Controls:**
            * **Database Audit Logging:** Enable comprehensive database audit logging to track authentication attempts, failed login attempts, and administrative actions. Regularly review these logs for suspicious activity.
            * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Implement network-based or host-based IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block brute-force attacks or suspicious database access patterns.
            * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate database logs into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring, alerting, and correlation of security events.

#### 4.2. HIGH RISK NODE: Publicly accessible database server (if misconfigured)

* **Attack Vector: Scan for publicly accessible database ports (e.g., 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL). If the database server is exposed to the internet without proper firewall rules, attackers can directly connect to it.**

    * **Detailed Attack Vector Description:**
        * **Port Scanning:** Attackers use automated tools like Nmap or Masscan to scan public IP address ranges for open database ports (e.g., 3306 for MySQL/MariaDB, 5432 for PostgreSQL, 27017 for MongoDB).
        * **Direct Connection:** If a database port is found to be open and accessible from the internet, attackers can attempt to connect directly to the database server using database clients or command-line tools.
        * **Exploitation of Database Vulnerabilities:** Once connected, attackers can attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities in the database software itself (e.g., unpatched versions, SQL injection vulnerabilities if application-level security is also weak).
        * **Credential Brute-forcing (again):** Even if passwords are not weak, a publicly exposed database significantly increases the attack surface for brute-force attacks, as attackers can directly target the database server without needing to bypass application-level authentication first.

    * **Impact:** **Full database access, allowing direct retrieval, modification, or deletion of all financial data.**

        * **Identical to "Weak database passwords" impact:** The impact is the same as described in the previous section, leading to confidentiality breach, integrity compromise, availability disruption, and reputational damage. The primary difference is the attack vector that leads to this access.

    * **Likelihood Assessment:** **MEDIUM to HIGH (depending on deployment environment).**  Accidental misconfigurations leading to publicly exposed database servers are unfortunately common, especially in cloud environments or during rapid deployments. Automated scanners constantly probe the internet for open ports, making publicly accessible databases easily discoverable.  The likelihood is lower if proper network security practices are consistently followed, but misconfigurations can happen.

    * **Mitigation Strategies:**

        * **Preventative Controls:**
            * **Network Segmentation and Firewalls:**
                * **Restrict Database Access:**  Implement strict firewall rules to block all incoming connections to database ports from the public internet. Only allow connections from trusted sources, such as the application server(s) hosting Firefly III.
                * **Private Network:** Ideally, place the database server on a private network (e.g., a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in cloud environments or a separate VLAN in on-premises networks) that is not directly accessible from the internet.
                * **Bastion Host/Jump Server:** If remote access to the database server is required for administration, use a bastion host or jump server in a public subnet as a secure intermediary.
            * **Listen Address Configuration:** Configure the database server to listen only on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) or the private network interface, preventing it from binding to public interfaces.
            * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate any misconfigurations that might expose the database server to the internet.
            * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use IaC tools (like Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) to automate infrastructure deployments and ensure consistent and secure configurations, reducing the risk of manual misconfigurations.

        * **Detective Controls:**
            * **Port Scanning Detection:** Implement network monitoring tools that can detect unauthorized port scanning activity targeting your network.
            * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  IDS/IPS can detect and alert on or block attempts to connect to database ports from unauthorized networks.
            * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Monitor network traffic logs and firewall logs in a SIEM system to detect and alert on suspicious connections to database ports.
            * **External Security Scanning Services:** Utilize external security scanning services to periodically scan your public IP ranges and identify any unintentionally exposed services, including database ports.

### 5. Best Practice Recommendations for Database Security in Firefly III Deployments

In addition to the specific mitigations outlined above, the following general database security best practices should be implemented for Firefly III deployments:

* **Keep Database Software Up-to-Date:** Regularly apply security patches and updates to the database software (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the entire Firefly III infrastructure, including database configurations, to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
* **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Level):** Configure Firefly III to connect to the database using a user account with the minimum necessary privileges required for its operation. Avoid using administrative database accounts for application connections.
* **Input Validation and Parameterized Queries:**  While not directly related to database configuration, ensure that Firefly III application code properly validates user inputs and uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, which could also lead to database compromise.
* **Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Consider enabling database encryption at rest to protect data stored on disk. Ensure that connections between Firefly III and the database are encrypted using TLS/SSL to protect data in transit.
* **Regular Backups and Disaster Recovery:** Implement a robust backup and disaster recovery plan for the database to ensure data can be restored in case of data loss or compromise. Store backups securely and offline if possible.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate development and operations teams about database security best practices and the importance of secure configurations.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and best practices, development and deployment teams can significantly reduce the risk of "Insecure Database Configuration" vulnerabilities and protect sensitive financial data within Firefly III.
