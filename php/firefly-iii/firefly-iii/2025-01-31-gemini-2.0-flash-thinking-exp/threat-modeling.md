# Threat Model Analysis for firefly-iii/firefly-iii

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Firefly III's code to inject malicious SQL queries into the database. This is done by manipulating input fields or parameters used in database interactions. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass authentication, steal sensitive financial data, modify transactions, or even gain full control of the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality), Data manipulation (integrity), System compromise (availability).
*   **Affected Firefly III Component:** Database interaction layer, affecting modules like transaction handling, reporting, and user management.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions within Firefly III's codebase.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious SQL code from reaching database queries.
    *   Keep Firefly III updated to the latest version, ensuring patches for known SQL injection vulnerabilities are applied.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts targeting Firefly III.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into Firefly III web pages by exploiting vulnerabilities in how user-supplied data is handled and displayed. This injected script executes in the browsers of other users, allowing attackers to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of legitimate users within Firefly III.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality - session hijacking), Data manipulation (integrity - defacement, unauthorized actions), Reputational damage.
*   **Affected Firefly III Component:** User interface components displaying dynamic content, such as transaction descriptions, notes, and account names.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict output encoding and escaping for all user-generated content displayed by Firefly III. Use context-aware encoding (HTML, JavaScript, URL).
    *   Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the sources from which browsers can load resources, reducing the impact of XSS attacks within Firefly III.
    *   Regularly update Firefly III to patch any identified XSS vulnerabilities in its code.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate object identifiers (like IDs in URLs or API requests) to bypass authorization checks within Firefly III. By guessing or manipulating these IDs, they can gain unauthorized access to financial resources (transactions, accounts, budgets) belonging to other users or resources they shouldn't access, potentially viewing or modifying sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality), Data manipulation (integrity), Unauthorized access to financial data and functionalities.
*   **Affected Firefly III Component:** Authorization logic within various modules, particularly API endpoints and controllers that handle data access based on object IDs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce server-side authorization checks for every resource access request in Firefly III. Never rely solely on client-side checks.
    *   Use indirect object references (UUIDs, hashes) instead of predictable sequential IDs to make guessing valid object identifiers significantly harder.
    *   Implement robust Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Firefly III to manage user permissions and enforce authorization policies consistently.
    *   Conduct regular security audits of Firefly III's authorization logic to ensure it effectively prevents unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** A critical vulnerability in Firefly III's authentication mechanism allows attackers to completely bypass the login process. This could be due to flaws in password verification, session handling, or the core authentication logic itself. Successful bypass grants attackers full, unauthorized access to the application without needing valid user credentials.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality), Data manipulation (integrity), Full system compromise (availability, integrity, confidentiality).
*   **Affected Firefly III Component:** Authentication module, login functionality, session management components of Firefly III.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize well-vetted and secure authentication libraries and frameworks within Firefly III.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional security layer for user logins to Firefly III.
    *   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation) within Firefly III's user management.
    *   Perform rigorous security testing and audits specifically focused on Firefly III's authentication mechanism.
    *   Immediately apply security updates for Firefly III to patch any known authentication vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation](./threats/privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, after gaining initial access to Firefly III with a low-privileged user account, exploits vulnerabilities in the application's authorization or role management system. This allows them to elevate their privileges to a higher level, potentially becoming an administrator. With elevated privileges, they can access sensitive data, modify system settings, and perform actions beyond their intended permissions within Firefly III.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality), Data manipulation (integrity), System compromise (availability, integrity, confidentiality).
*   **Affected Firefly III Component:** Authorization module, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation, user management features of Firefly III.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning user roles and permissions within Firefly III.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions to ensure they are appropriate and correctly configured.
    *   Thoroughly test Firefly III's authorization logic to identify and fix any privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    *   Keep Firefly III updated to patch any discovered privilege escalation vulnerabilities in its code.

## Threat: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./threats/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If Firefly III allows file uploads (e.g., for data import or attachments), vulnerabilities in the file upload handling process can be exploited. Attackers can upload malicious files (like web shells or malware) that, when processed or accessed by Firefly III, could lead to code execution on the server, potentially compromising the entire system.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on the server, System compromise (availability, integrity, confidentiality), Data breach.
*   **Affected Firefly III Component:** Import/Export functionality, file upload handlers, and any modules within Firefly III that process uploaded files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict allowed file upload types to only necessary and safe formats within Firefly III.
    *   Implement strict file size limits for uploads to prevent resource exhaustion and potential abuse.
    *   Perform comprehensive input validation and sanitization on all uploaded files to remove or neutralize potentially malicious content.
    *   Store uploaded files outside of the web root directory to prevent direct execution of uploaded scripts.
    *   Integrate malware scanning of uploaded files using antivirus software before they are processed by Firefly III.
