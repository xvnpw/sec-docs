## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Application Using Firefly III](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_using_firefly_iii.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. All subsequent nodes and paths lead to this objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Firefly III Vulnerabilities Directly](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_firefly_iii_vulnerabilities_directly.md)

This node represents attacks that directly target vulnerabilities within the Firefly III application code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Default Credentials Exploitation**
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Use default admin/user credentials (if not changed during setup)**
                * Attack Vector: Attempt to log in using well-known default usernames (e.g., admin, administrator, user) and passwords (e.g., password, admin, user, 123456) that might be present if the application setup process did not enforce or guide users to change them.
                * Impact: Full administrative access to the Firefly III application, allowing complete control over financial data and application settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: SQL Injection**
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Inject malicious SQL queries via input fields (e.g., transaction descriptions, account names)**
                * Attack Vector: Craft malicious SQL code and inject it into input fields of the application (e.g., transaction descriptions, account names, search parameters). If the application does not properly sanitize or parameterize database queries, the injected SQL code will be executed by the database server.
                * Impact: Data breach (extraction of sensitive financial data), data manipulation (modification or deletion of financial records), potential system compromise (depending on database server permissions and vulnerabilities).
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Stored XSS: Inject malicious scripts stored in database (e.g., in transaction notes, category names)**
                * Attack Vector: Inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields that are stored in the database and later displayed to other users (e.g., transaction notes, category names, account descriptions). When other users view these stored data, the malicious script will execute in their browsers.
                * Impact: Account compromise (session hijacking, credential theft), data theft (stealing sensitive information displayed on the page), defacement (altering the appearance of the application for other users).
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Reflected XSS: Inject malicious scripts via URL parameters or form submissions**
                * Attack Vector: Inject malicious JavaScript code into URL parameters or form submissions. If the application reflects this input back to the user without proper output encoding, the malicious script will execute in the user's browser.
                * Impact: Account compromise (session hijacking, credential theft), data theft (stealing sensitive information displayed on the page), redirection to malicious websites.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Data Storage Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_data_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Insecure Database Configuration**
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Weak database passwords**
                * Attack Vector: Attempt to guess or brute-force weak passwords used for database accounts. Default database credentials or easily guessable passwords are common targets.
                * Impact: Full database access, allowing direct retrieval, modification, or deletion of all financial data.
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Publicly accessible database server (if misconfigured)**
                * Attack Vector: Scan for publicly accessible database ports (e.g., 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL). If the database server is exposed to the internet without proper firewall rules, attackers can directly connect to it.
                * Impact: Full database access, allowing direct retrieval, modification, or deletion of all financial data.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Vulnerable PHP Libraries/Packages**
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated PHP libraries used by Firefly III (e.g., Laravel framework, other dependencies)**
                * Attack Vector: Identify outdated PHP libraries and packages used by Firefly III. Search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with these outdated versions. Exploit these vulnerabilities using publicly available exploits or by developing custom exploits.
                * Impact: Remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breach, and denial of service.
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Vulnerable PHP Version**
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated PHP version used to run Firefly III**
                * Attack Vector: Identify the PHP version used to run Firefly III. If it's an outdated version, search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with that PHP version. Exploit these vulnerabilities using publicly available exploits or by developing custom exploits.
                * Impact: Remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breach, and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exposed Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exposed_configuration_files.md)

* **HIGH RISK NODE: Access configuration files (e.g., `.env` files) containing database credentials, API keys, etc., if not properly secured**
        * Attack Vector: Attempt to access configuration files, especially `.env` files, which often contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and application secrets. This can be achieved through directory traversal vulnerabilities, web server misconfigurations, or simply guessing common file paths if the files are not properly secured outside the web root.
        * Impact: Credential theft (database credentials, API keys), full application compromise (using stolen credentials to gain administrative access or access backend systems).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Firefly III Configuration and Deployment Issues](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_firefly_iii_configuration_and_deployment_issues.md)

This node represents attacks that exploit vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration and deployment practices of the application environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Misconfiguration of Web Server](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_misconfiguration_of_web_server.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration**
            * Attack Vector: Analyze the SSL/TLS configuration of the web server hosting Firefly III. Identify weak ciphers, outdated protocols, or other misconfigurations that could allow Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
            * Impact: Man-in-the-Middle attacks, allowing interception of sensitive data transmitted between users and the server (including login credentials, financial data).
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Missing Security Headers**
            * Attack Vector: Check for the presence of important security headers (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Strict-Transport-Security`). Missing security headers can make the application more vulnerable to client-side attacks like XSS and clickjacking.
            * Impact: Increased risk of client-side attacks, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, and defacement.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Publicly Exposed Database Port](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_publicly_exposed_database_port.md)

Attack Vector: Scan for publicly accessible database ports (e.g., 3306 for MySQL, 5432 for PostgreSQL). If the database server port is exposed to the internet due to firewall misconfiguration, attackers can directly attempt to connect to the database.
    * Impact: Direct database access, allowing retrieval, modification, or deletion of all financial data.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Insufficient Security Hardening](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insufficient_security_hardening.md)

Attack Vectors:
        * **HIGH RISK PATH: Outdated Software Components**
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Outdated Operating System**
                * Attack Vector: Identify the operating system running the server hosting Firefly III. If it's an outdated version, search for known OS-level vulnerabilities (CVEs). Exploit these vulnerabilities using publicly available exploits or by developing custom exploits.
                * Impact: System compromise, potentially leading to full control of the server, data breach, and denial of service.
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Outdated Web Server**
                * Attack Vector: Identify the web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and version running on the server. If it's an outdated version, search for known web server vulnerabilities (CVEs). Exploit these vulnerabilities using publicly available exploits or by developing custom exploits.
                * Impact: System compromise, potentially leading to full control of the server, data breach, and denial of service.
            * **HIGH RISK NODE: Outdated PHP Version (Reiterated from Dependency Vulnerabilities but also a configuration issue)**
                * Attack Vector: (Same as point 6.b) Identify the PHP version used. If outdated, exploit known PHP vulnerabilities.
                * Impact: (Same as point 6.b) Remote code execution, system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
