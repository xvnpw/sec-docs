## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Firefly III Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_firefly_iii_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Firefly III Vulnerabilities** ** CRITICAL NODE **
* This is the overarching goal of exploiting weaknesses within the Firefly III application code itself. It encompasses various specific vulnerability types.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_vulnerabilities.md)

*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities
* **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Weak Password Reset Functionality:**  Abusing flaws in the password reset process to gain access to an account without knowing the original password (e.g., predictable reset tokens, lack of email verification).
        * **Exploit Session Management Flaws:**  Taking over or hijacking a legitimate user's session (e.g., session fixation, predictable session IDs, lack of proper session invalidation).
        * **Exploit Insecure Cookie Handling:**  Manipulating or stealing session cookies due to insecure storage or transmission (e.g., lack of HTTPOnly or Secure flags).
        * **Exploit Missing or Weak Multi-Factor Authentication (if implemented):**  Circumventing or bypassing MFA due to weaknesses in its implementation (e.g., SMS interception, social engineering, bypass codes).
* **Elevate Privileges (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Insecure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Exploiting flaws in how user roles and permissions are managed to gain access to functionalities or data that should be restricted (e.g., manipulating role assignments, accessing admin functionalities with lower privileges).
        * **Exploit Parameter Tampering to Gain Admin Access:**  Modifying request parameters (e.g., user IDs, role identifiers) to trick the application into granting administrative privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication_mechanisms.md)

Bypass Authentication Mechanisms ** CRITICAL NODE **
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Weak Password Reset Functionality:**  Abusing flaws in the password reset process to gain access to an account without knowing the original password (e.g., predictable reset tokens, lack of email verification).
        * **Exploit Session Management Flaws:**  Taking over or hijacking a legitimate user's session (e.g., session fixation, predictable session IDs, lack of proper session invalidation).
        * **Exploit Insecure Cookie Handling:**  Manipulating or stealing session cookies due to insecure storage or transmission (e.g., lack of HTTPOnly or Secure flags).
        * **Exploit Missing or Weak Multi-Factor Authentication (if implemented):**  Circumventing or bypassing MFA due to weaknesses in its implementation (e.g., SMS interception, social engineering, bypass codes).

## Attack Tree Path: [Elevate Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/elevate_privileges.md)

Elevate Privileges ** CRITICAL NODE **
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Insecure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Exploiting flaws in how user roles and permissions are managed to gain access to functionalities or data that should be restricted (e.g., manipulating role assignments, accessing admin functionalities with lower privileges).
        * **Exploit Parameter Tampering to Gain Admin Access:**  Modifying request parameters (e.g., user IDs, role identifiers) to trick the application into granting administrative privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Data Injection Vulnerabilities ** CRITICAL NODE **

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities ** CRITICAL NODE **
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Inject Malicious SQL Queries via Input Fields:**  Inserting malicious SQL code into input fields (e.g., login forms, search bars, transaction descriptions) that is then executed by the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data.
        * **Inject Malicious SQL Queries via API Endpoints:**  Similar to input fields, but targeting API endpoints that process user-supplied data, allowing for database manipulation through API calls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_command_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities ** CRITICAL NODE **
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Inject Malicious Commands via Input Fields that Interact with the System:**  Inserting operating system commands into input fields that are used by the application to execute system-level operations (e.g., file processing, system calls), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerabilities.md)

*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities ** CRITICAL NODE **
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Firefly III:**  Leveraging known security flaws in the PHP libraries or frameworks that Firefly III depends on (e.g., Laravel components, other dependencies) to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        * **Exploit Unsafe File Upload Functionality (if present):**  Uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) that can be executed by the web server, granting the attacker control over the server.
        * **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable):**  Manipulating serialized data that is then unserialized by the application, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Database Manipulation (If Attacker Gains Database Access)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_database_manipulation__if_attacker_gains_database_access_.md)

Direct Database Manipulation (If Attacker Gains Database Access) ** CRITICAL NODE **
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Modify Transaction Records, Balances, or User Information:**  Directly altering data within the Firefly III database to manipulate financial records, steal funds, or gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This requires the attacker to have already compromised the database server or obtained database credentials through other means.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Outdated or Vulnerable PHP Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_or_vulnerable_php_libraries.md)

*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Outdated or Vulnerable PHP Libraries ** CRITICAL NODE **
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Gain Access Through Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries Like Laravel Components or Other Dependencies:**  Exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries used by Firefly III. This often involves using existing exploits to gain remote code execution or other forms of access.
