### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Elevate Privileges

**Elevate Privileges  ** CRITICAL NODE **

This critical node represents the attacker's goal of gaining higher levels of access and control within the Firefly III application than they are initially authorized for. Successful privilege escalation can grant attackers the ability to access sensitive data, modify critical configurations, and potentially compromise the entire system.

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Exploit Insecure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting flaws in how Firefly III manages user roles and permissions. Attackers aim to bypass intended access restrictions by manipulating or leveraging weaknesses in the RBAC implementation.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**

* **Missing or Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  Code sections that fail to properly verify a user's role or permissions before granting access to sensitive functionalities or data. For example, accessing administrative API endpoints without proper authentication or authorization.
* **Default or Weak Role Assignments:**  Default user roles with overly broad permissions or easily guessable/exploitable mechanisms for assigning roles.
* **Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities:**  Specific flaws in the RBAC logic that allow a user with lower privileges to elevate their own privileges or assign higher privileges to other accounts. This could involve manipulating API calls, exploiting race conditions, or leveraging flaws in role inheritance.
* **Inconsistent RBAC Enforcement:**  Discrepancies in how RBAC is enforced across different parts of the application (e.g., inconsistencies between UI and API access controls).
* **Lack of Input Validation on Role-Related Data:**  Insufficient validation of user-provided data related to roles or permissions, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious values or bypass security checks.
* **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:**  If Firefly III relies on third-party libraries for RBAC implementation, vulnerabilities in those libraries could be exploited.
* **Direct Database Manipulation:**  If the application doesn't properly protect database access, an attacker who gains access to the database could directly modify user roles and permissions.

**Attack Techniques:**

* **Direct API Manipulation:**  Crafting API requests to access administrative functionalities or modify user roles, bypassing UI restrictions.
* **Parameter Tampering (related to RBAC):**  Modifying parameters related to user roles or permissions in requests (e.g., changing a `role_id` parameter).
* **Exploiting Race Conditions:**  Attempting to perform actions simultaneously to exploit timing vulnerabilities in role assignment or permission checks.
* **Leveraging Default Credentials:**  If default administrative accounts or credentials exist and haven't been changed, attackers can use them to gain immediate access.
* **Social Engineering:**  Tricking administrators into granting them higher privileges.
* **Exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Manipulate User Actions:**  Using XSS to execute malicious scripts in an administrator's browser, potentially leading to unintended role modifications.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:**  Gaining access to financial records, user details, and other confidential information.
* **Data Modification or Deletion:**  Altering or deleting critical financial data, leading to inaccurate records and potential financial losses.
* **System Compromise:**  Gaining control over the application's infrastructure, potentially leading to further attacks on the server or connected systems.
* **Account Takeover:**  Elevating privileges to take over other user accounts, including administrative accounts.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust and damage to the application's reputation due to security breaches.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement Robust and Consistent Authorization Checks:**  Ensure that every access to sensitive functionalities and data is properly authorized based on the user's role and permissions. Utilize a well-defined and consistently applied authorization framework.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their tasks. Avoid assigning overly broad roles.
* **Secure Role Assignment Mechanisms:**  Implement secure and auditable processes for assigning and modifying user roles. Avoid relying on easily guessable or manipulable methods.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in the RBAC implementation.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided data related to roles and permissions to prevent injection attacks.
* **Secure API Design:**  Design API endpoints with security in mind, ensuring proper authentication and authorization for all sensitive operations.
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Keep all third-party libraries used for RBAC implementation up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Database Access:**  Implement strong access controls and authentication mechanisms for database access to prevent unauthorized modifications.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Administrative Accounts:**  Require MFA for all administrative accounts to add an extra layer of security.
* **Role Hierarchy and Inheritance:**  If using role hierarchies, ensure they are correctly implemented and do not introduce unintended privilege escalation paths.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Exploit Parameter Tampering to Gain Admin Access

**Description:** This attack vector involves manipulating request parameters (e.g., in URLs, form data, cookies) to trick the application into granting administrative privileges to an unauthorized user.

**Potential Vulnerabilities:**

* **Lack of Server-Side Validation:**  The application relies solely on client-side validation or fails to properly validate parameters related to user roles or permissions on the server-side.
* **Predictable Parameter Names or Values:**  Using easily guessable parameter names (e.g., `is_admin=true`, `role_id=1`) that attackers can easily manipulate.
* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  Exposing internal object IDs (e.g., user IDs, role IDs) in URLs or parameters without proper authorization checks, allowing attackers to potentially access or modify resources belonging to other users or roles.
* **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:**  Allowing users to modify object properties they shouldn't have access to by submitting extra parameters in requests. This could include parameters related to their own roles or permissions.
* **Cookie Manipulation:**  Storing sensitive information like user roles or permissions directly in cookies without proper encryption or integrity protection, allowing attackers to modify them.
* **Hidden Form Fields:**  Relying on hidden form fields to convey role or permission information, which can be easily inspected and modified by attackers.

**Attack Techniques:**

* **Modifying URL Parameters:**  Changing parameters in the URL (e.g., `user_id`, `role_id`, `is_admin`) to attempt to gain access to administrative functionalities.
* **Manipulating Form Data:**  Intercepting and modifying form data before submission, altering parameters related to user roles or permissions.
* **Cookie Poisoning:**  Modifying cookie values related to user roles or authentication to impersonate an administrator.
* **Modifying Hidden Form Fields:**  Inspecting the HTML source code and modifying the values of hidden form fields related to roles or permissions.
* **Replay Attacks:**  Capturing legitimate requests and modifying parameters before replaying them to the server.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Unauthorized Access to Administrative Features:**  Gaining access to administrative panels, settings, and functionalities.
* **Account Takeover:**  Elevating privileges to take over administrative accounts.
* **Data Breach:**  Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data.
* **System Manipulation:**  Modifying critical system configurations or data.
* **Malicious Code Injection:**  Potentially using elevated privileges to inject malicious code into the application or server.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Server-Side Validation:**  Always perform thorough validation of all request parameters on the server-side, especially those related to user roles and permissions. Never rely solely on client-side validation.
* **Avoid Exposing Internal IDs:**  Use indirect object references or access control mechanisms to prevent attackers from directly manipulating internal object IDs.
* **Whitelist Input Validation:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed values for parameters related to roles and permissions.
* **Secure Cookie Management:**  Store sensitive information in cookies securely using encryption and integrity checks (e.g., using the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags). Avoid storing sensitive role information directly in cookies.
* **Protect Against Mass Assignment:**  Carefully control which properties can be modified through user input. Use mechanisms like DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) or explicit whitelisting of allowed fields.
* **Implement Proper Authorization Checks:**  Verify user roles and permissions before granting access to any sensitive functionality, regardless of the request parameters.
* **Use POST Requests for Sensitive Operations:**  Prefer using POST requests for actions that modify data or grant privileges, as they are less likely to be cached or logged in URLs.
* **Implement Anti-CSRF Tokens:**  Protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which could be used to trick authenticated users into performing actions that elevate privileges.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Specifically test for parameter tampering vulnerabilities during security assessments.
