#### *** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities

This high-risk path highlights the critical importance of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in securing the Firefly III application. Successful exploitation in this area can grant attackers unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive financial data.

**A. Bypass Authentication Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE):**

This node represents the attacker's goal of circumventing the application's login process to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

* **Attack Vectors:**

    * **Exploit Weak Password Reset Functionality:**
        * **Vulnerability:** Flaws in the password reset process that allow an attacker to reset a user's password without proper authorization.
        * **Attack Scenario:** An attacker might identify predictable reset tokens, intercept reset links, or exploit the lack of email verification to initiate a password reset for a target user and set a new password.
        * **Impact:** Full account takeover, access to financial data, potential for fraudulent transactions or data manipulation.
        * **Risk:** High - Password reset functionality is a common target for attackers.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Generate cryptographically secure, unpredictable reset tokens.**
            * **Implement strict email verification for password reset requests.**
            * **Use time-limited reset tokens.**
            * **Consider implementing account lockout after multiple failed reset attempts.**
            * **Regularly review and test the password reset process for vulnerabilities.**

    * **Exploit Session Management Flaws:**
        * **Vulnerability:** Weaknesses in how user sessions are created, maintained, and invalidated.
        * **Attack Scenario:**
            * **Session Fixation:** An attacker forces a user to use a known session ID.
            * **Predictable Session IDs:** Session IDs are generated in a predictable manner, allowing attackers to guess valid IDs.
            * **Lack of Proper Session Invalidation:** Sessions are not properly terminated upon logout or after a period of inactivity.
        * **Impact:** Account hijacking, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities, potential for persistent access.
        * **Risk:** High - Session management is crucial for maintaining user context and security.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Generate cryptographically secure, unpredictable session IDs.**
            * **Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation.**
            * **Implement secure session storage (e.g., HTTPOnly, Secure flags for cookies).**
            * **Set appropriate session timeouts and implement automatic logout after inactivity.**
            * **Properly invalidate sessions upon logout.**

    * **Exploit Insecure Cookie Handling:**
        * **Vulnerability:**  Weaknesses in how session cookies or other authentication-related cookies are handled by the application and the user's browser.
        * **Attack Scenario:**
            * **Lack of HTTPOnly Flag:** Attackers can access session cookies via client-side scripts (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
            * **Lack of Secure Flag:** Session cookies are transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, making them vulnerable to interception (Man-in-the-Middle attacks).
        * **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, exposure of sensitive information.
        * **Risk:** High - Improper cookie handling is a common vulnerability with significant consequences.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Set the `HTTPOnly` flag for session cookies to prevent client-side script access.**
            * **Set the `Secure` flag for session cookies to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.**
            * **Avoid storing sensitive information directly in cookies if possible.**
            * **Use short expiry times for cookies where appropriate.**

    * **Exploit Missing or Weak Multi-Factor Authentication (if implemented):**
        * **Vulnerability:**  Weaknesses in the implementation of MFA that allow attackers to bypass the additional security layer.
        * **Attack Scenario:**
            * **SMS Interception:** Intercepting SMS-based MFA codes.
            * **Social Engineering:** Tricking users into providing MFA codes.
            * **Bypass Codes:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the generation or management of bypass codes.
            * **Lack of Rate Limiting:** Brute-forcing MFA codes.
        * **Impact:** Circumvention of MFA, unauthorized access to accounts that should be protected by an additional security layer.
        * **Risk:** Medium to High (depending on the weakness) - While MFA adds a layer of security, its effectiveness depends on its implementation.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Use more secure MFA methods than SMS (e.g., authenticator apps, hardware tokens).**
            * **Educate users about social engineering tactics.**
            * **Implement robust rate limiting for MFA attempts.**
            * **Securely manage and rotate bypass codes.**
            * **Enforce strong password policies even with MFA enabled.**

**B. Elevate Privileges (CRITICAL NODE):**

Once an attacker has gained initial access (potentially through bypassing authentication), the next goal might be to escalate their privileges to gain access to more sensitive data or functionalities.

* **Attack Vectors:**

    * **Exploit Insecure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
        * **Vulnerability:** Flaws in how user roles and permissions are defined, assigned, and enforced.
        * **Attack Scenario:**
            * **Manipulating Role Assignments:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to change a user's assigned role to a higher-privileged one.
            * **Accessing Admin Functionalities with Lower Privileges:** Finding loopholes that allow users with lower privileges to access administrative functions or data.
            * **Lack of Granular Permissions:** Overly broad permissions assigned to roles, granting unnecessary access.
        * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical application settings, potential for complete system compromise.
        * **Risk:** High - Improperly implemented RBAC can lead to significant security breaches.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Implement a well-defined and granular RBAC system.**
            * **Follow the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions.**
            * **Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.**
            * **Enforce RBAC consistently across the application.**
            * **Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent manipulation of role-related parameters.**

    * **Exploit Parameter Tampering to Gain Admin Access:**
        * **Vulnerability:**  The application trusts user-supplied input without proper validation, allowing attackers to modify request parameters to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Attack Scenario:** An attacker might modify URL parameters, form data, or API requests to change user IDs, role identifiers, or other parameters that control access levels. For example, changing `user_id=123` to `user_id=1` (assuming user ID 1 is an administrator).
        * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to administrative functionalities, data manipulation, and potential for complete system takeover.
        * **Risk:** High - Parameter tampering is a common and often easily exploitable vulnerability.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Never trust user-supplied input.**
            * **Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side.**
            * **Avoid relying on client-side checks for authorization.**
            * **Use secure methods for managing user sessions and roles on the server-side.**
            * **Implement access control checks on the server-side before granting access to sensitive resources or functionalities.**
