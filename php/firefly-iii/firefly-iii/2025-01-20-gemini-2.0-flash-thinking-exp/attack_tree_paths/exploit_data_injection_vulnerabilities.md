        * **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining administrative access to the database, allowing for complete control over the application's data.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Executing resource-intensive queries to overload the database.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  The most effective defense against SQL injection. Ensure all database interactions use parameterized queries where user input is treated as data, not executable code.
        * **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs before they are used in database queries. Use whitelisting to allow only expected characters and formats.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant database users only the necessary permissions. Avoid using the 'root' or 'administrator' database user for application connections.
        * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Identify and address potential SQL injection vulnerabilities proactively.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser.
    * **Potential Attack Vectors in Firefly III:**
        * Input fields for transaction descriptions, notes, or tags.
        * User profile information fields.
        * Comment sections or any area where user-generated content is displayed.
        * Error messages that might reflect user input.
    * **Types of XSS:**
        * **Stored (Persistent) XSS:** Malicious scripts are stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected data. This is particularly dangerous in a financial application.
        * **Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS:** Malicious scripts are injected through URLs or form submissions and reflected back to the user.
        * **DOM-based XSS:** Vulnerability exists in client-side JavaScript code that improperly handles user input.
    * **Potential Impact:**
        * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
