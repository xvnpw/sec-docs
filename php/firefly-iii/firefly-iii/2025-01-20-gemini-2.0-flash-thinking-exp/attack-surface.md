# Attack Surface Analysis for firefly-iii/firefly-iii

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:**  User-provided data in various fields (transaction descriptions, category names, rule descriptions, etc.) might not be properly sanitized before being displayed *by Firefly III*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject a `<script>` tag into a transaction description *within Firefly III*. When another user views this transaction *in Firefly III*, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting them to a malicious site.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application interface *within Firefly III*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided data displayed in the application. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript contexts). Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Regularly update front-end libraries *used by Firefly III*.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Exposure and Abuse](./attack_surfaces/api_key_exposure_and_abuse.md)

*   **Description:**  If API keys are not securely managed or are leaked, attackers can use them to access and manipulate data through the API.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:** Firefly III allows users to generate API tokens *within the application* for programmatic access. If these tokens are not stored securely by users or if *Firefly III's* API doesn't have sufficient rate limiting or access controls, they can be abused.
    *   **Example:** A user accidentally commits their API token *generated by Firefly III* to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the token and uses it to retrieve all the user's financial data or create fraudulent transactions *through the Firefly III API*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to financial data, data manipulation, potential financial loss *within Firefly III*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement robust API key generation and management practices *within Firefly III*. Encourage users to treat API keys as sensitive credentials. Implement rate limiting and proper authorization checks on API endpoints *of the Firefly III API*. Consider using more secure authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 for API access.
        *   **Users:** Store API tokens *generated by Firefly III* securely (e.g., using password managers). Be cautious about sharing API tokens. Regularly regenerate API tokens *within Firefly III*. Revoke tokens *in Firefly III* when they are no longer needed or suspected of being compromised.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries into input fields, potentially gaining unauthorized access to or manipulating the database.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:** If user input *within Firefly III* is not properly sanitized and parameterized before being used in database queries *by Firefly III*, it can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This could occur in various data entry points *within the application*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could enter a malicious string in a transaction description field *in Firefly III* that, when processed by the application's database query, allows them to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data *from the Firefly III database*.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breach, data manipulation, potential denial of service *of the Firefly III application*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions *within Firefly III*. This prevents user input from being directly interpreted as SQL code. Employ an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that handles query construction securely *within Firefly III*. Regularly review database queries for potential vulnerabilities *in Firefly III's codebase*. Implement input validation to restrict the type and format of user input *within Firefly III*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, it can lead to remote code execution.
    *   **How Firefly III Contributes:** If Firefly III uses serialization for data transfer or storage and doesn't properly validate the data being deserialized, it could be vulnerable. This might occur in session management or other data handling processes *within Firefly III*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious serialized object and trick *Firefly III* into deserializing it, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server *hosting Firefly III*.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise *of the Firefly III instance*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible *in Firefly III*. If necessary, use secure serialization formats and implement robust integrity checks (e.g., using message authentication codes). Restrict the classes that can be deserialized. Regularly update libraries used for serialization *within Firefly III*.
