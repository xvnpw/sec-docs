# Attack Surface Analysis for walkor/workerman

## Attack Surface: [Direct Network Exposure](./attack_surfaces/direct_network_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Workerman applications directly listen on network ports, making them directly accessible from the network.
    *   **How Workerman Contributes:** Workerman's core functionality is to act as a standalone socket server, requiring it to bind to network interfaces and ports to receive connections. This direct exposure bypasses the traditional web server layer.
    *   **Example:** A Workerman application listening on port 80 is directly reachable by sending HTTP requests to that port. If the application has a vulnerability in its handling of these requests (e.g., a buffer overflow in a custom HTTP parser), it can be exploited directly.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, potential data breaches, denial of service by overwhelming the port, or even remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to the Workerman ports from only trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   Use network segmentation to isolate the Workerman application within a protected network zone.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege for network access.
        *   Rigorously validate and sanitize all incoming data received on the listening ports.
        *   Consider running Workerman behind a reverse proxy for added security and traffic management.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Protocol Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_protocol_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Workerman often involves implementing custom network protocols or using less common protocols for communication. Errors in parsing or handling these protocols can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Workerman Contributes:** Workerman provides the framework for handling raw socket data, giving developers the flexibility to define their own communication protocols directly within the Workerman application. This flexibility introduces the risk of insecure implementations.
    *   **Example:** A custom protocol implementation might not properly validate the length of incoming data, leading to a buffer overflow when a larger-than-expected payload is received. This could allow an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (crashing the worker process), information disclosure, or remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly design and test custom protocols with security as a primary concern.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received according to the protocol specification.
        *   Use established and well-vetted protocol libraries where possible instead of implementing everything from scratch.
        *   Implement proper error handling and logging for protocol parsing failures.
        *   Consider using a well-defined and secure serialization format.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Specific Attacks (Focus on High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/websocket_specific_attacks__focus_on_high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** When using Workerman for WebSocket implementations, vulnerabilities specific to the WebSocket protocol with high potential impact can be exploited.
    *   **How Workerman Contributes:** Workerman provides built-in support for the WebSocket protocol, making it easy to implement real-time communication. Insecure handling of WebSocket messages within the Workerman application can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** If the Workerman application doesn't properly sanitize data received through a WebSocket connection before using it in a database query, it could be vulnerable to WebSocket-based injection attacks. Sending a large number of connection requests without proper handling can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion, potential for injection attacks if data is not sanitized, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users (if authentication is flawed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate the `Origin` header in WebSocket handshake requests to prevent Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for WebSocket connections.
        *   Rate-limit incoming WebSocket messages and connections to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   Sanitize and validate all data received through WebSocket connections before processing it.
        *   Keep the Workerman library and any related WebSocket libraries up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities (Impacting Security)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities__impacting_security_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Workerman settings can introduce significant security risks.
    *   **How Workerman Contributes:** Workerman's configuration options directly determine how it operates and interacts with the system. Insecure configurations directly expose the application to threats.
    *   **Example:** Running the Workerman process as root grants it unnecessary and dangerous privileges. If a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker gains root access. Binding Workerman to `0.0.0.0` without a firewall exposes it to the entire internet.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation leading to full system compromise, unauthorized access from anywhere on the internet, information disclosure through overly verbose logging.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never run Workerman as root.** Create a dedicated, non-privileged user account for the Workerman process.
        *   Bind Workerman to specific network interfaces or use firewalls to restrict access to only necessary networks.
        *   Disable debug mode and verbose logging in production environments to prevent information leakage.
        *   Regularly review and audit Workerman configuration settings to ensure they adhere to security best practices.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring resource access for the Workerman process.
