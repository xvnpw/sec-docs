## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Payload in Socket Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_payload_in_socket_data__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Inject shell commands via crafted data (e.g., in process names, etc.)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit flaws in how Workerman parses specific protocols (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket)
    *   **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious headers or data within protocols like HTTP or WebSocket that exploit vulnerabilities in how Workerman parses these protocols, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious actions.
