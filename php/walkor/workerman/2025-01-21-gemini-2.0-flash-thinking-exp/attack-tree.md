## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Workerman Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_workerman_exploitation.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker, encompassing all successful attacks against the application through Workerman.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Workerman Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_workerman_core.md)

This node signifies attacks that directly target weaknesses within the Workerman framework itself. Successful exploitation here can have widespread and severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

This critical node represents the ability of an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This grants them full control over the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Workerman Features or Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_workerman_features_or_configuration.md)

This node highlights the risks associated with misusing or misconfiguring Workerman's features. This often stems from developer error or a lack of understanding of security implications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Running Workers with Elevated Privileges (e.g., root)](./attack_tree_paths/running_workers_with_elevated_privileges__e_g___root_.md)

This is a particularly critical node because if a worker process running with elevated privileges is compromised, the attacker immediately gains those elevated privileges, often leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Workerman Core -> Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_workerman_core_-_achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Data Injection (Specific to Protocol Handling):**
        Attackers craft malicious data packets specifically designed to exploit flaws in how the application parses custom protocols implemented using Workerman. This can lead to buffer overflows, command injection, or other vulnerabilities that allow code execution.
    **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Application Uses Unsafe Deserialization with Workerman):**
        If the application deserializes untrusted data received through Workerman, attackers can send specially crafted serialized objects. These objects, when deserialized, can trigger the execution of arbitrary code due to vulnerabilities in the application's classes or available "gadget chains".

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Workerman Core -> Achieve Denial of Service (DoS) -> Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_workerman_core_-_achieve_denial_of_service__dos__-_resource_exhaustion.md)

Attackers flood the Workerman application with a large number of connection requests, overwhelming the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can render the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    Attackers send specific requests that are designed to consume excessive resources within the worker processes, leading to slowdowns or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Workerman Core -> Bypass Security Mechanisms -> Exploit Weaknesses in Authentication/Authorization (If Implemented within Workerman Application)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_workerman_core_-_bypass_security_mechanisms_-_exploit_weaknesses_in_authe_6ebb0713.md)

Attackers identify and exploit flaws in the application's authentication or authorization logic, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities. This could involve sending crafted requests that bypass checks or exploiting weaknesses in session management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Workerman Features or Configuration -> Exploit Insecure Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_workerman_features_or_configuration_-_exploit_insecure_configuration.md)

**Running Workers with Elevated Privileges (e.g., root):**
        If worker processes are inadvertently configured to run with root or other high privileges, any successful exploit against a worker process grants the attacker those elevated privileges.
    **Exposing Internal Ports Without Proper Firewalling:**
        Workerman might be configured to listen on ports intended for internal communication or management. If these ports are exposed to the public internet without proper firewall rules, attackers can directly access these internal services, potentially leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Workerman Features or Configuration -> Exploit Insecure Protocol Handling (If Custom Protocols are Used)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_workerman_features_or_configuration_-_exploit_insecure_protocol_handling__if_custom_protocols__dba4a075.md)

**Protocol Confusion Attacks:**
        Attackers send data formatted according to a different protocol than expected, hoping to exploit parsing vulnerabilities or trigger unexpected behavior in the application's protocol handling logic.
    **Injection Attacks within Custom Protocols:**
        Attackers inject malicious commands or data within the structure of the custom protocol messages. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate this data, it can lead to command injection or other vulnerabilities.
