# Attack Surface Analysis for walkor/workerman

## Attack Surface: [Custom Protocol Implementation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/custom_protocol_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the design and implementation of custom application-layer protocols within Workerman.  This is the most significant Workerman-specific risk area.
    *   **How Workerman Contributes:** Workerman provides the framework for defining and handling custom protocols. The security of the protocol logic is entirely the developer's responsibility, and Workerman's flexibility here creates a large potential attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A custom protocol for a real-time game has an integer overflow vulnerability in the handling of player scores, allowing an attacker to manipulate scores and potentially gain unauthorized access.  Or, a custom protocol uses `unserialize()` on data received from clients without proper validation, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Corruption, Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (RCE is a critical risk; other flaws are typically high).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Formal Protocol Specification:** A detailed, unambiguous specification is essential.
        *   **Rigorous Input Validation:** Validate *all* fields, checking types, lengths, and ranges. Use whitelists.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzing tools to test the protocol parser with malformed input.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Avoid dangerous functions (e.g., `unserialize()` on untrusted data). Use memory-safe string handling.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Multiple developers should review the protocol implementation.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to find potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Limit Protocol Complexity:** Simpler protocols are easier to secure.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that consume server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors, network bandwidth) by exploiting Workerman's connection handling capabilities.
    *   **How Workerman Contributes:** Workerman's core design focuses on handling a large number of persistent connections, making it a prime target for DoS attacks that exploit this capability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker opens thousands of connections to a Workerman server and either sends no data (holding connections open) or sends data very slowly ("slowloris" attack), exhausting server resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), rendering the application unavailable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Connection Limits:** Implement per-IP and global connection limits.
        *   **Timeouts:** Set appropriate read and write timeouts for idle connections (using Workerman's configuration).
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate of new connections from a single IP.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources and set alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute connections across multiple Workerman instances using a load balancer.
        *   **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy) for connection management, rate limiting, and SSL termination.

## Attack Surface: [Extension Vulnerabilities (If High/Critical Impact)](./attack_surfaces/extension_vulnerabilities__if_highcritical_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Security issues introduced by vulnerable *Workerman extensions* that have a direct, high or critical impact. This is distinct from general application dependencies.
    *   **How Workerman Contributes:** Workerman's extensibility allows for custom functionality, but poorly written or malicious extensions can directly compromise the Workerman process.
    *   **Example:** A custom Workerman extension designed to interact with a database has a SQL injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands *through the Workerman process*. Or, an extension that handles file uploads allows arbitrary file writes, leading to RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but *specifically* includes vulnerabilities that directly impact the Workerman process itself, potentially leading to RCE, DoS, or data breaches *within the context of Workerman's operation*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the extension's functionality and the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Selection:** Only use extensions from trusted sources.
        *   **Code Review:** *Thoroughly* review the code of *any* Workerman extension before deployment.
        *   **Security Audits:** Conduct security audits of custom extensions.
        *   **Update Regularly:** Keep extensions updated.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run extensions with minimal privileges.  If the extension interacts with external services (database, etc.), use restricted credentials.
