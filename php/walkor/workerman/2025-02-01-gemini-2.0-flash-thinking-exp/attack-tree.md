*   **Attack Vector:** Exploits vulnerabilities in the application's logic to cause a denial of service.

    *   **4.1. Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Requests [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Resource Exhaustion, Send Requests that Trigger CPU/Memory Intensive Operations]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker sends specially crafted requests that trigger computationally expensive or memory-intensive operations within the application logic.
        *   **Mechanism:** Targets inefficient algorithms, unoptimized database queries, or resource-intensive functionalities in the application code.
        *   **Impact:** Overloads worker processes, exhausts server resources (CPU, memory), leading to service degradation or unavailability.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious inputs from triggering excessive resource consumption.
            *   Optimize resource-intensive operations in the application code.
            *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling to limit the impact of malicious requests.
            *   Consider using caching mechanisms to reduce the load on backend resources.
            *   Monitor resource usage of Workerman processes and set alerts for high CPU or memory consumption.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Insecure Configuration and Deployment of Workerman Application [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__insecure_configuration_and_deployment_of_workerman_application__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploits vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration and deployment practices.

    *   **5.1. Insufficient Resource Limits (OS/Container Level) [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Lack of Resource Limits]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker leverages the absence of proper resource limits (e.g., memory limits, CPU limits) at the operating system or container level to launch resource exhaustion attacks.
        *   **Mechanism:** By sending resource-intensive requests or exploiting application vulnerabilities, the attacker can consume excessive resources, potentially crashing the application or the entire server.
        *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application instability, potential server compromise in extreme cases.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Configure appropriate resource limits (memory, CPU, file descriptors, etc.) at the OS or container level for Workerman processes.
            *   Monitor resource usage and adjust limits as needed based on application requirements and expected load.
            *   Implement resource quotas and cgroups to enforce limits and prevent resource starvation.

    *   **5.2. Insecure File Permissions/Access Control [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Weak File Permissions, Read Sensitive Configuration Files, Modify Application Code, Gain Persistence]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker exploits weak file permissions or access control configurations to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files or modify application code.
        *   **Mechanism:** Leverages misconfigured file permissions that allow unauthorized users to read, write, or execute files within the application's deployment directory.
        *   **Impact:**
            *   **Read Sensitive Configuration Files:** Information disclosure of credentials, API keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive secrets.
            *   **Modify Application Code:** Code injection, backdoors, defacement, and complete control over application functionality.
            *   **Gain Persistence:** Ability to maintain unauthorized access to the system even after restarts or security patches.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement the principle of least privilege for file permissions.
            *   Ensure that sensitive configuration files are not world-readable and are only accessible to the Workerman process user and administrators.
            *   Regularly audit file permissions and access control configurations.
            *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications to application code or configuration files.

    *   **5.3. Running Workerman as Root User [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Running as Root User, Exploit Any Vulnerability to Escalate to Root Privileges, Full System Compromise]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Running Workerman processes as the root user creates a critical security vulnerability. Any vulnerability exploited in the Workerman application can lead to immediate root-level compromise of the entire system.
        *   **Mechanism:** If a vulnerability (e.g., code execution, privilege escalation) is found in the Workerman application, and the process is running as root, the attacker automatically gains root privileges upon successful exploitation.
        *   **Impact:** **Critical - Full System Compromise.** Complete control over the server, including data theft, system manipulation, installation of malware, and use of the server for further attacks.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never run Workerman processes as the root user.**
            *   Create a dedicated, low-privileged user account specifically for running Workerman processes.
            *   Ensure proper process isolation and security hardening measures are in place to limit the impact of any potential compromise.
