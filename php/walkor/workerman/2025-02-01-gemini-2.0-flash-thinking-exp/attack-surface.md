# Attack Surface Analysis for walkor/workerman

## Attack Surface: [Direct Network Exposure via Raw Sockets](./attack_surfaces/direct_network_exposure_via_raw_sockets.md)

*   **Description:** Workerman applications listen directly on network sockets, bypassing traditional web servers. This exposes the application directly to network traffic and removes default security layers.
    *   **Workerman Contribution:** Workerman's core design is to act as a socket server, inherently requiring direct socket listening, making it a fundamental part of its attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A Workerman application listening on port 8080 directly exposed to the internet without any firewall. Attackers can directly send malicious requests to this port.
    *   **Impact:** Direct exposure increases vulnerability to network-level attacks, including DDoS, port scanning, and direct exploitation of application vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a Reverse Proxy (like Nginx or Apache) in front of Workerman for TLS termination, request filtering, and basic DDoS protection.
        *   Configure Firewalls to restrict access to Workerman's port, allowing only necessary traffic.
        *   Implement Network Segmentation to isolate Workerman within a secure network.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Protocol Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Workerman is often used for custom protocols. Insecure or poorly implemented custom protocol parsing in PHP code can introduce critical vulnerabilities.
    *   **Workerman Contribution:** Workerman's flexibility encourages custom protocols. Secure protocol implementation is the developer's responsibility within the Workerman application.
    *   **Example:** A custom protocol parser with a buffer overflow. Crafted messages exceeding buffer size could lead to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Design protocols with security in mind, including input validation and message size limits.
        *   Implement Robust Input Validation and sanitization for all custom protocol data.
        *   Conduct Security Audits and Code Reviews of protocol parsing logic.
        *   Utilize well-vetted libraries for protocol parsing where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Application Logic Vulnerabilities in Event Handlers](./attack_surfaces/application_logic_vulnerabilities_in_event_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** Workerman applications rely on event handlers (`onConnect`, `onMessage`, etc.). Vulnerabilities in the code within these handlers are directly exploitable via network requests.
    *   **Workerman Contribution:** Workerman's event-driven architecture places application logic directly in handlers, making them primary entry points and attack targets.
    *   **Example:** An `onMessage` handler executing user-provided data as a system command without sanitization, leading to command injection.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Manipulation, Privilege Escalation, Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply Secure Coding Practices, including input validation and output encoding in event handlers.
        *   Implement Strict Input Sanitization and Validation for all user inputs in handlers.
        *   Adhere to the Principle of Least Privilege for worker processes.
        *   Perform Regular Security Testing and vulnerability scanning of application logic.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration and Deployment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_and_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations like running as root or exposing management interfaces directly increase the attack surface and potential impact of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Workerman Contribution:** Workerman's configuration flexibility means incorrect choices can directly lead to security weaknesses.
    *   **Example:** Running a Workerman process as root. Code execution exploits could lead to full system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Full System Compromise, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always Run as Non-Root User for Workerman worker processes.
        *   Ensure Secure Configuration of all Workerman options, including ports and protocols.
        *   Implement Resource Limits (memory, CPU, connections) to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   Secure Management Interfaces with strong authentication and restrict access, or disable them in production.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Built-in TLS/SSL Termination](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_built-in_tlsssl_termination.md)

*   **Description:** Workerman requires manual TLS/SSL implementation. Omission or misconfiguration leads to unencrypted communication of sensitive data.
    *   **Workerman Contribution:** Workerman's design leaves TLS/SSL implementation to the application level, placing the burden of secure implementation on developers.
    *   **Example:** Handling sensitive data over plain TCP without TLS/SSL, exposing data to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach, Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, Eavesdropping.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always Implement TLS/SSL encryption for sensitive communication using well-vetted libraries.
        *   Utilize a Reverse Proxy for TLS Termination to offload complexity and leverage robust configurations.
        *   Regularly Review and Update TLS Configurations to ensure strong ciphers and protocols are used.
