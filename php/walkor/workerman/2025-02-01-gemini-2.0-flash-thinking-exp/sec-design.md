# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project aims to utilize the Workerman framework to build high-performance, real-time applications. The primary business priorities are achieving low latency, high concurrency, and efficient resource utilization for network-based services. The goal is to create applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections and provide instant data delivery, potentially for use cases like real-time chat, game servers, or push notification systems.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:
- Security vulnerabilities in the Workerman framework or in the application code built upon it, which could lead to data breaches or service disruption.
- Performance bottlenecks or instability under high load, which could negatively impact user experience and service availability.
- Operational complexity in managing and maintaining a real-time application infrastructure, potentially leading to increased costs and downtime.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code reviews are likely performed as part of the software development lifecycle, although the extent and rigor are unknown. (Location: Development process)
- security control: Version control system (Git/GitHub) is used for code management and history tracking. (Location: GitHub Repository)
- accepted risk: Usage of open-source framework Workerman introduces potential vulnerabilities inherent in third-party software.
- accepted risk: PHP runtime environment may have known vulnerabilities if not properly patched and configured.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application code.
- security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by the application.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses in the application and infrastructure.
- security control: Implement Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) or Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against runtime attacks.
- security control: Implement robust security logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Securely authenticate users or systems interacting with the application. Consider appropriate authentication mechanisms based on the application's use case (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0, session-based authentication).
- Authorization: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to ensure that users or systems only have access to the resources and actions they are permitted to access. Follow the principle of least privilege.
- Input Validation: Thoroughly validate all input data received by the application to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting). Implement input sanitization and encoding as needed.
- Cryptography: Use strong cryptography to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest. Implement encryption for communication channels (TLS/SSL) and consider encryption for sensitive data stored in databases or caches.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Real-time communication and data delivery to end-users.
- Availability and performance of the application under high load.
- Integrity and confidentiality of application data.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User data (potentially PII depending on the application, e.g., usernames, chat messages, profile information) - Medium to High sensitivity.
- Application data (business-specific data processed by the application) - Sensitivity depends on the application.
- System logs and metrics (potentially containing sensitive information) - Low to Medium sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific type of application is being built using Workerman? (e.g., chat application, game server, API gateway).
- What are the specific data sensitivity requirements for the application?
- What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the application?
- What are the compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) if any?
- What is the organization's risk appetite and security maturity level?

Assumptions:
- The application being built is a generic real-time web application.
- Data sensitivity is medium, including user PII.
- The application is expected to handle a moderate to high load.
- Deployment environment is cloud-based (AWS).
- Standard security best practices are desired.
- The organization has a moderate risk appetite and is willing to invest in security controls.
