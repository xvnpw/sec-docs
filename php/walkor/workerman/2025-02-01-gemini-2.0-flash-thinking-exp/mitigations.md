# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for walkor/workerman

## Mitigation Strategy: [Worker Process Recycling (Workerman Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/worker_process_recycling__workerman_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement `Worker::$maxEventLoops` or `Worker::$maxRequests`:** Utilize Workerman's built-in mechanisms for worker recycling.
        *   `Worker::$maxEventLoops`: Set a limit on the number of event loop iterations a worker process will execute before restarting. This is useful for memory leak mitigation in long-running connections.
        *   `Worker::$maxRequests`: Set a limit on the number of requests a worker process will handle before restarting. This is effective for PHP applications where request handling might lead to resource accumulation.
    2.  **Configure Recycling in `Worker` Initialization:**  Within your Workerman application's main script, configure these properties when initializing your `Worker` instances. For example:
        ```php
        use Workerman\Worker;

        $http_worker = new Worker("http://0.0.0.0:8080");
        $http_worker->count = 4;
        $http_worker->maxRequests = 1000; // Restart after 1000 requests
        $http_worker->onMessage = function($connection, $data) {
            $connection->send('hello ' . $data);
        };

        Worker::runAll();
        ```
    3.  **Choose Appropriate Recycling Strategy:** Select either `maxEventLoops` or `maxRequests` or a combination based on your application's characteristics and potential resource leak patterns. For long-lived connections (like WebSockets), `maxEventLoops` might be more relevant. For request-response applications, `maxRequests` is often suitable.
    4.  **Monitor Worker Restarts:** Monitor your Workerman logs and process manager logs to ensure worker recycling is happening as configured and without unexpected errors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Leaks in Worker Processes (Medium Severity):** PHP applications, especially with certain extensions or libraries, can experience memory leaks over time. Recycling workers prevents long-term memory accumulation and potential crashes.
    *   **Resource Accumulation in Worker Processes (Medium Severity):**  Even without explicit memory leaks, worker processes can accumulate resources like database connections, file handles, or internal state over time. Recycling provides a clean slate.
    *   **Mitigation of Long-Lived Compromised Processes (Medium Severity):** If a vulnerability is exploited in a worker process, regular recycling limits the window of opportunity for an attacker to maintain persistence within that specific process instance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Leaks:** Significantly reduces the impact of memory leaks by preventing long-term accumulation and related instability.
    *   **Resource Accumulation:** Significantly reduces the impact of resource accumulation, maintaining application stability and performance over time.
    *   **Long-Lived Compromised Processes:** Partially reduces the risk by forcing attackers to re-establish any foothold after worker restarts.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Basic daily service restart via `supervisorctl restart workerman` is in place, which indirectly recycles workers.
    *   `Worker::$maxRequests` or `Worker::$maxEventLoops` are not explicitly configured within the Workerman application code.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicitly configure `Worker::$maxRequests` or `Worker::$maxEventLoops` in the Workerman application's `Worker` initialization.
    *   Determine optimal values for `maxRequests` or `maxEventLoops` based on application load and resource usage patterns.
    *   Implement monitoring specifically for worker restarts triggered by `maxRequests` or `maxEventLoops` to ensure it's functioning as expected.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits and Rate Limiting (Workerman Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits_and_rate_limiting__workerman_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement `Worker::$connections` Limit:** Utilize `Worker::$connections` to set a maximum number of concurrent connections a worker process will accept. This is a built-in Workerman mechanism to prevent resource exhaustion from excessive connections.
    2.  **Configure Connection Limit in `Worker` Initialization:** Set the `connections` property when initializing your `Worker` instances:
        ```php
        use Workerman\Worker;

        $ws_worker = new Worker("websocket://0.0.0.0:8484");
        $ws_worker->count = 4;
        $ws_worker->connections = 1000; // Limit to 1000 concurrent connections per worker
        $ws_worker->onConnect = function($connection) {
            echo "new connection\n";
        };
        $ws_worker->onMessage = function($connection, $data) {
            $connection->send('hello ' . $data);
        };

        Worker::runAll();
        ```
    3.  **Implement Application-Level Rate Limiting in `onConnect` or `onMessage`:**  For more granular rate limiting based on IP address, user, or request type, implement custom rate limiting logic within your `onConnect` or `onMessage` callbacks.
        *   Use a storage mechanism (e.g., Redis, Memcached, in-memory array with TTL) to track request counts or connection attempts per client.
        *   In `onConnect` or `onMessage`, check the rate limit for the client's IP address or user identifier.
        *   If the rate limit is exceeded, reject the connection or delay request processing.
    4.  **Consider Reverse Proxy Rate Limiting (Optional but Recommended for HTTP):** If your Workerman application serves HTTP, leverage rate limiting features of a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy in front of Workerman for initial DoS protection and offloading rate limiting logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Floods (High Severity):** `Worker::$connections` directly mitigates connection flood DoS attacks by limiting the number of concurrent connections a worker will handle, preventing resource exhaustion from excessive connections.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Application-level rate limiting can slow down or block brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts or API requests from a single source within a time window.
    *   **Application-Level DoS (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting can protect against application-level DoS attacks where attackers send a high volume of legitimate-looking requests to overwhelm the application logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS - Connection Floods:** Significantly reduces the risk. `Worker::$connections` provides a direct and effective defense against connection-based DoS.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Partially reduces the risk. Rate limiting makes brute-force attacks slower and less effective, increasing the attacker's effort and detection probability.
    *   **Application-Level DoS:** Partially reduces the risk. Rate limiting can mitigate some application-level DoS attacks, but may not be sufficient for sophisticated attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Reverse proxy (Nginx) is in place, but rate limiting is not currently configured at the reverse proxy level.
    *   `Worker::$connections` is not explicitly set in Workerman application code.
    *   Application-level rate limiting is not implemented in `onConnect` or `onMessage` callbacks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configure `Worker::$connections` in Workerman application's `Worker` initialization to limit concurrent connections per worker.
    *   Implement application-level rate limiting in `onConnect` or `onMessage` callbacks, potentially using Redis or Memcached for rate limit tracking.
    *   Configure rate limiting at the reverse proxy (Nginx) level for HTTP services to provide an initial layer of DoS protection.
    *   Define appropriate rate limit thresholds based on expected traffic patterns and application capacity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure WebSocket Handling (Workerman Specific - if using WebSockets)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_websocket_handling__workerman_specific_-_if_using_websockets_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Validate WebSocket Origin Header:** In the `onWebSocketConnect` callback, validate the `$_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN']` header to prevent Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. Only allow connections from trusted origins.
        ```php
        use Workerman\Worker;

        $ws_worker = new Worker("websocket://0.0.0.0:8484");
        $ws_worker->onWebSocketConnect = function($connection, $http_header) {
            $allowed_origins = ['https://yourdomain.com', 'https://anotherdomain.com'];
            $origin = $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] ?? '';
            if (!in_array($origin, $allowed_origins)) {
                $connection->close(); // Reject connection from untrusted origin
                return false;
            }
            return true; // Accept connection
        };
        // ... rest of WebSocket worker logic
        ```
    2.  **Implement WebSocket Message Validation:**  Apply strict input validation to all WebSocket messages received in the `onMessage` callback. Treat WebSocket messages as untrusted user input and validate data types, formats, and content to prevent injection vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior. (Refer to "Strict Input Validation" strategy for details).
    3.  **Secure WebSocket Authentication and Authorization:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for WebSocket connections. Do not rely on the assumption that WebSocket connections are inherently secure. Use methods like:
        *   **Token-based Authentication:**  Exchange tokens during the initial HTTP handshake or via a separate authentication flow before establishing the WebSocket connection. Validate tokens in `onWebSocketConnect` or `onMessage`.
        *   **Session-based Authentication:**  If using HTTP sessions, ensure session management is secure and session IDs are protected.
    4.  **Output Encoding for WebSocket Messages:** Apply secure output encoding to all data sent back to WebSocket clients in the `onMessage` callback to prevent XSS vulnerabilities if the client-side application renders WebSocket data in a web context. (Refer to "Secure Output Encoding" strategy for details).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) (High Severity - WebSocket specific):** Origin validation in `onWebSocketConnect` directly prevents CSWSH attacks by ensuring only connections from authorized origins are accepted.
    *   **WebSocket Injection Attacks (High Severity - WebSocket specific):** Input validation of WebSocket messages prevents injection vulnerabilities within the WebSocket communication flow.
    *   **Unauthorized Access via WebSockets (High Severity - WebSocket specific):** Lack of authentication and authorization allows unauthorized users to access WebSocket functionalities and data.
    *   **WebSocket-based XSS (Medium Severity - WebSocket specific):**  Improper output encoding of WebSocket messages can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if client-side applications render WebSocket data in a web browser.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH):** Significantly reduces the risk. Origin validation is a primary defense against CSWSH.
    *   **WebSocket Injection Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk. Input validation is crucial for securing WebSocket message handling.
    *   **Unauthorized Access via WebSockets:** Significantly reduces the risk. Proper authentication and authorization are essential for controlling access to WebSocket services.
    *   **WebSocket-based XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk. Output encoding prevents XSS vulnerabilities arising from WebSocket message rendering.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Basic WebSocket functionality is implemented.
    *   Origin validation in `onWebSocketConnect` is not implemented.
    *   Input validation for WebSocket messages is inconsistent and not rigorously enforced.
    *   WebSocket authentication and authorization are not fully implemented; relying on implicit security assumptions.
    *   Output encoding for WebSocket messages is not consistently applied.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement origin validation in `onWebSocketConnect` to prevent CSWSH attacks.
    *   Implement robust input validation for all WebSocket messages received in `onMessage`.
    *   Implement a secure WebSocket authentication and authorization mechanism (e.g., token-based).
    *   Apply consistent output encoding to all WebSocket messages sent to clients to prevent XSS.
    *   Regularly review and update the list of allowed origins for WebSocket connections.
