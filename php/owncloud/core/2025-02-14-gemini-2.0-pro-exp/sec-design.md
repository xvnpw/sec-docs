Okay, let's create a design document for the ownCloud core project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

ownCloud is an open-source file sync and share solution, allowing users to store and access their files, calendars, contacts, and other data on a server they control.  It competes with commercial offerings like Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive, but with a focus on data privacy and control.  The core project provides the foundational server-side components.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a reliable and stable file sync and share platform.
*   Maintain user data privacy and security.
*   Enable self-hosting and on-premises deployments.
*   Offer a flexible and extensible platform through apps and APIs.
*   Foster a strong open-source community and ecosystem.
*   Attract and retain users, both individuals and organizations.
*   Maintain compatibility with various storage backends (local, object storage, etc.).

Business Goals:

*   Increase user adoption and market share in the self-hosted file sync and share space.
*   Become the leading open-source alternative to commercial cloud storage providers.
*   Establish a sustainable development model through community contributions and enterprise offerings.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or loss of user data, leading to reputational damage and loss of trust.
*   Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
*   Inability to scale to meet the demands of large organizations or high user loads.
*   Lack of features or functionality compared to commercial competitors.
*   Failure to maintain compatibility with evolving web standards and client platforms.
*   Legal or regulatory challenges related to data privacy and security.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on reviewing the GitHub repository and general knowledge of ownCloud):

*   security control: Authentication: User authentication via username/password, with support for two-factor authentication (2FA) through apps. Implemented in core authentication logic and various authentication apps.
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) and granular permissions for files and folders. Implemented in core file access and sharing logic.
*   security control: Encryption: Server-side encryption at rest (optional, configurable). Encryption in transit using HTTPS (TLS).  End-to-end encryption is available via a separate app. Described in documentation and implemented in encryption apps and core file handling.
*   security control: Input Validation: Validation of user inputs to prevent common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. Implemented throughout the codebase, particularly in request handling and data processing.
*   security control: CSRF Protection: Measures to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Implemented using CSRF tokens.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: ownCloud encourages security audits and has a bug bounty program. Documented on the ownCloud website.
*   security control: Security Headers: Use of security-related HTTP headers (e.g., HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options). Implemented in web server configuration and core response handling.
*   security control: File Integrity Checking: Mechanisms to detect unauthorized modifications to files. Implemented in core file handling.
*   security control: Brute-Force Protection: Measures to mitigate brute-force login attempts. Implemented in authentication logic.
*   security control: Session Management: Secure handling of user sessions. Implemented in core authentication and session management.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries and dependencies, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by administrators, leading to security weaknesses.
*   accepted risk: The complexity of the codebase and the large number of features increase the attack surface.
*   accepted risk: The open-source nature of the project means that vulnerabilities may be discovered and exploited before patches are available.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks.
*   Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Implement a robust secrets management solution to protect API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data.
*   Provide more detailed security hardening guides for administrators.
*   Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong password policies.
    *   Mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) option for administrators.
    *   Integration with external identity providers (e.g., LDAP, SAML, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Session timeout and automatic logout after a period of inactivity.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control lists (ACLs) for files and folders.
    *   Ability to define different roles with specific permissions.
    *   Auditing of all authorization decisions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs, including file names, paths, and metadata.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, etc.).
    *   Regular expression validation for specific input fields.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA, SHA-256).
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection of data in transit using TLS 1.3 or higher.
    *   Optional server-side encryption at rest with user-managed keys.
    *   Support for end-to-end encryption.

## BUILD

The ownCloud core project uses a combination of tools and processes for building and publishing releases.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Git Push" --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"];
    GitHub -- "Webhook" --> CI["CI Server (GitHub Actions)"];
    CI -- "Build Steps" --> BuildArtifacts["Build Artifacts (tar.gz, zip)"];
    CI -- "Publish" --> ReleaseServer["Release Server (download.owncloud.org)"];
    CI -- "Security Checks" --> SecurityReports["Security Reports"];

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and push changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions (CI/CD) is triggered by pushes and pull requests.
3.  The CI server runs build scripts, which typically involve:
    *   Checking out the code.
    *   Installing dependencies (using Composer for PHP).
    *   Running unit tests.
    *   Running integration tests.
    *   Performing static code analysis (e.g., PHPStan, linters).
    *   Building release packages (tar.gz, zip).
4.  Build artifacts are created and stored.
5.  Security checks are performed as part of the build process, including:
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - potentially using tools integrated into GitHub Actions or separate scanning tools.
    *   Dependency vulnerability scanning - checking for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
6.  Successful builds are published to the release server (download.owncloud.org).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Automated Build: GitHub Actions ensures consistent and repeatable builds.
*   Dependency Management: Composer helps manage PHP dependencies and track versions.
*   Unit and Integration Tests: Automated tests help catch bugs and regressions.
*   Static Code Analysis: Tools like PHPStan and linters help identify potential code quality and security issues.
*   SAST (Potentially): Integration of SAST tools can help identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   Dependency Vulnerability Scanning: Tools can be used to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Signed Releases (Potentially): Release packages could be digitally signed to ensure authenticity and integrity.
