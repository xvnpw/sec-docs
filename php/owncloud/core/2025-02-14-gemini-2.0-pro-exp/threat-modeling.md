# Threat Model Analysis for owncloud/core

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Session Fixation in Core Session Handling](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_session_fixation_in_core_session_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker pre-determines a session ID and injects it into a victim's browser. If ownCloud core doesn't properly invalidate or regenerate session IDs upon *successful login*, the attacker hijacks the victim's session *after* authentication. This is specific to ownCloud's *internal* session management.
*   **Impact:** Complete account takeover; attacker accesses all victim's data and can perform administrative actions.
*   **Affected Core Component:** `lib/private/Session/`. Functions related to session creation, validation, and destruction (e.g., `Session::setId()`, `Session::validateSession()`, and interaction with the configured session handler).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Ensure ownCloud core *always* regenerates session IDs upon successful authentication. Review `lib/private/Session/` for proper session fixation prevention. Use secure session ID generation.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Group Management Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_group_management_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with a low-privileged account exploits a flaw in ownCloud core's group management logic. This could involve improperly validated input when adding users to groups, modifying group permissions, or creating new groups, allowing the attacker to grant themselves administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Attacker gains administrative control, accessing all data, modifying configurations, and potentially compromising the server.
*   **Affected Core Component:** `lib/private/Group/`. Functions related to group management, user membership, and permission checks (e.g., `GroupManager::add()`, `GroupManager::addUserToGroup()`, `GroupManager::getGroups()`, and related database queries).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Thoroughly review and audit `lib/private/Group/` for input validation vulnerabilities and logic errors. Ensure all group-related operations are properly authorized and privilege checks are enforced.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Flaw in File Versioning](./threats/data_tampering_via_flaw_in_file_versioning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in ownCloud's *core* file versioning system.  This could involve manipulating version history metadata, injecting malicious content into older versions, or bypassing access controls to modify/delete specific versions. The vulnerability is in *how* ownCloud manages versions internally.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, loss of data integrity, potential injection of malicious code, unauthorized access to previous file versions.
*   **Affected Core Component:** `lib/private/Files/Versions/`. Functions related to storing, retrieving, and managing file versions (e.g., `Versions::storeVersion()`, `Versions::getVersions()`, `Versions::rollback()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Rigorously test and audit `lib/private/Files/Versions/` for vulnerabilities related to data integrity, access control, and input validation. Ensure version history is protected from unauthorized modification.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Leaky API Endpoint](./threats/information_disclosure_via_leaky_api_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted requests to a *specific* ownCloud core API endpoint that is not properly secured or validated.  This exposes sensitive information like user details, file metadata, internal paths, or configuration settings. This is a flaw in a *specific* ownCloud core API, not a general API security issue.
*   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information usable for further attacks (social engineering, targeted phishing, privilege escalation).
*   **Affected Core Component:** `lib/private/OCS/` (for OCS API endpoints) or other relevant API controllers within `lib/private/` or `apps/`. Specific functions handling API requests/responses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Review all API endpoints in `lib/private/OCS/` and other relevant locations for proper authentication, authorization, and input validation. Ensure only necessary information is exposed. Implement strict output encoding.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Preview Generation Vulnerability](./threats/information_disclosure_via_preview_generation_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted file (image, document) exploiting a vulnerability in ownCloud's *core* preview generation library. This could allow access to other files, execution of arbitrary code, or leakage of sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Core Component:** `lib/private/Preview/`. Functions related to generating previews. Vulnerabilities in external libraries (ImageMagick, LibreOffice) *as used by ownCloud* are relevant.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Regularly update external libraries used for preview generation. Implement sandboxing or isolation to limit the impact of vulnerabilities. Sanitize input to preview generators.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Federated Authentication Misconfiguration (if core-integrated)](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_federated_authentication_misconfiguration__if_core-integrated_.md)

*   **Description:** If ownCloud *core* handles federated authentication (SAML, OAuth) directly (not through an app), a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the *core integration* could allow authentication bypass or user impersonation. This targets ownCloud's specific implementation.
*   **Impact:** Complete account takeover.
*   **Affected Core Component:** If present, likely in `lib/private/Authentication/` or a dedicated module for federated authentication within the core.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** If federated authentication is core-integrated, follow best practices for secure implementation of the chosen protocol (SAML, OAuth). Thoroughly validate all assertions/responses from the identity provider.
