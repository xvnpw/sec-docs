## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_core_functionality.md)

*   **File Storage/Sharing Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **-> HIGH RISK -> Path Traversal [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided to the ownCloud core to access files outside the intended directory. This could allow them to read, modify, or delete arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration files, user data, and potentially even system files.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **Apps/Plugins Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **-> HIGH RISK -> Code Injection [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the ownCloud core's app/plugin framework to inject and execute malicious code. This code could run with the privileges of the ownCloud core, granting the attacker complete control over the system. This is often due to insufficient sandboxing or input validation.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

    *   **Trust Boundary Bypass [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** A vulnerability that allows a malicious or compromised app/plugin to circumvent the intended security restrictions imposed by the ownCloud core. This could allow the app to access resources or perform actions it shouldn't be able to, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (if bundled in core) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The ownCloud core includes third-party libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise the ownCloud instance. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from information disclosure to complete system takeover.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Improper Access Control Checks:**
    *   **Missing Checks in Core API/Components [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** A critical API endpoint or internal component within the ownCloud core lacks the necessary authorization checks. This allows an attacker, potentially even an unauthenticated one, to access sensitive data or perform privileged actions without proper authorization.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
