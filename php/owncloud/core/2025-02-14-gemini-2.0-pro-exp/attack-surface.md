# Attack Surface Analysis for owncloud/core

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass (Login & Session Management)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__login_&_session_management_.md)

*   **1. Authentication Bypass (Login & Session Management)**

    *   **Description:**  Circumventing ownCloud's core authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or the system.
    *   **Core Contribution:** ownCloud's *core* implements the login process, session token generation, handling, and validation.  It also provides the core framework for MFA and password reset *enforcement*.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a flaw in core's session token generation to predict a valid session ID, hijacking an active user's session.  Or, a vulnerability in the core password reset *flow logic* allows an attacker to reset a user's password without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete account takeover, unauthorized access to all user data, potential for privilege escalation to administrator.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust session management within core, using cryptographically secure random token generation.
            *   Enforce strict session expiration and invalidation policies *in core*.
            *   Thoroughly test and secure the core password reset flow, including token generation, and rate limiting.
            *   Implement and enforce strong password complexity requirements *in core*.
            *   Provide and enforce the core framework for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
            *   Regularly audit and review authentication-related code *in core*.
            *   Use well-vetted authentication libraries and avoid custom implementations where possible *within core*.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized File Access (Sharing & Permissions)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_file_access__sharing_&_permissions_.md)

*   **2. Unauthorized File Access (Sharing & Permissions)**

    *   **Description:**  Accessing files or folders that a user should not have permission to access, due to flaws in ownCloud's *core* sharing or permissions model.
    *   **Core Contribution:** ownCloud's *core* defines and enforces the sharing model (public links, user-to-user, group sharing), Access Control Lists (ACLs), and API authorization *logic*.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a bug in the *core* ACL enforcement logic to access a file shared with a different user, bypassing the intended permissions.
    *   **Impact:**  Data leakage, unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for data modification or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly test and audit the *core* sharing and permissions logic, including edge cases and complex scenarios.
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *within core* to prevent injection attacks that could bypass permissions checks.
            *   Regularly review and update the *core* ACL enforcement mechanisms.
            *   Consider using a formal model for access control (e.g., RBAC, ABAC) within core to ensure consistency and reduce errors.

## Attack Surface: [WebDAV Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/webdav_exploitation.md)

*   **3. WebDAV Exploitation

    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in ownCloud's *core* implementation of the WebDAV protocol to gain unauthorized access, modify files, or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Core Contribution:** ownCloud's *core* provides the WebDAV server functionality, handling all WebDAV requests and enforcing authentication/authorization within the WebDAV context.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker uses a specially crafted WebDAV PUT request handled by *core* to upload a malicious file that bypasses file type restrictions or overwrites a critical system file.  Or, a vulnerability in the *core* PROPFIND handler allows an attacker to enumerate files and folders they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized file access, data modification, denial of service, potential for remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly test and audit the *core* WebDAV implementation, including all supported methods (PUT, GET, PROPFIND, DELETE, etc.).
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all WebDAV requests *within core*.
            *   Enforce strict authentication and authorization within the *core* WebDAV context.
            *   Regularly update any *core* WebDAV libraries and dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [OCS API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/ocs_api_abuse.md)

*   **4. OCS API Abuse

    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the *core* ownCloud Share API (OCS) to gain unauthorized access to data or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Core Contribution:** The *core* provides the OCS API endpoints and handles authentication, authorization, and data exposure through the API.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker discovers a *core* API endpoint that leaks sensitive user information without proper authentication. Or, a flaw in a *core* API allows an attacker to create or modify shares without the necessary permissions.
    *   **Impact:**  Data leakage, unauthorized access to user data and shares, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly test and audit all *core* OCS API endpoints, including authentication, authorization, and input validation.
            *   Implement robust rate limiting *within core* to prevent brute-force attacks on API endpoints.
            *   Use API keys or other strong authentication mechanisms for API access *enforced by core*.
            *   Regularly review and update the *core* API security controls.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Encryption Bypass (if core encryption is used)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_encryption_bypass__if_core_encryption_is_used_.md)

*   **5. Server-Side Encryption Bypass (if core encryption is used)

    *   **Description:**  Circumventing ownCloud's server-side encryption *if implemented in core* to gain access to unencrypted data.
    *   **Core Contribution:** If *core* implements server-side encryption at rest, it manages the key generation, encryption/decryption processes, and storage of encrypted data.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the *core* key management system to obtain the encryption keys, allowing them to decrypt all stored data. Or, a flaw in the *core* encryption/decryption process allows an attacker to inject malicious code or bypass the encryption altogether.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete data breach, unauthorized access to all stored data in unencrypted form.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) *within core*.
            *   Implement robust key management practices *within core*, including secure key storage, rotation, and access control.
            *   Thoroughly test and audit the *core* encryption/decryption processes.
            *   Regularly review and update the *core* encryption implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Vulnerabilities (`config.php`)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_vulnerabilities___config_php__.md)

*   **6. Configuration File Vulnerabilities (`config.php`)

    *    **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in how ownCloud *core* handles the `config.php` file to gain unauthorized access or modify system settings.
    *    **Core Contribution:** *Core* relies on `config.php` for crucial settings and handles its parsing and access.
    *    **Example:** An attacker gains read access to `config.php` due to misconfigured file permissions (though this is server config, core's *handling* of the file is the issue), revealing database credentials and other sensitive information. Or, an attacker exploits a vulnerability to inject malicious code into `config.php` *via a core flaw*, altering the system's behavior.
    *    **Impact:** Database compromise, system takeover, data leakage, denial of service.
    *    **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Ensure `config.php` is created with the most restrictive file permissions possible (server config, but *core* should provide guidance).
            *   Sanitize and validate all data read from `config.php` *within core*.
            *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in `config.php` if possible (use environment variables or other secure storage mechanisms, and *core* should provide mechanisms for this).
            *   Regularly review and update the *core* `config.php` handling code.
