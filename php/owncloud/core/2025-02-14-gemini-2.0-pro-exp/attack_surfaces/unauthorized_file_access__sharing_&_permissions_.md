Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Unauthorized File Access (Sharing & Permissions)" attack surface for an application using ownCloud/core.

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized File Access (Sharing & Permissions) in ownCloud/core

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, analyze, and propose mitigations for vulnerabilities within the ownCloud/core codebase that could lead to unauthorized file access through flaws in the sharing and permissions mechanisms.  We aim to reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized data modification/deletion.  This analysis will focus on *preventing* vulnerabilities, not just detecting them after deployment.

**Scope:**

This analysis will focus exclusively on the `ownCloud/core` repository.  We will examine the following components:

*   **Sharing Logic:**  Code related to creating, managing, and revoking shares (public links, user-to-user, group shares).  This includes the database schema related to shares.
*   **Permissions Model (ACLs):**  The core Access Control List (ACL) implementation, including how permissions are stored, evaluated, and enforced.  This includes any related database tables.
*   **API Authorization Logic:**  The code that handles authorization checks for API endpoints related to file access, sharing, and permissions management.  This is crucial, as many interactions with ownCloud occur via its API.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Specifically, we'll look at how `core` handles user-supplied input related to file paths, share IDs, user IDs, group IDs, and permission settings.  This is to identify potential injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Relevant Configuration Options:** Any configuration settings within `core` that impact sharing and permissions behavior.

We will *not* be directly analyzing:

*   Specific ownCloud apps (unless they directly interact with the core sharing/permissions mechanisms in a way that introduces a vulnerability *in core*).
*   Web server configurations (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
*   Database server configurations (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
*   Operating system-level file permissions.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the `ownCloud/core` source code, focusing on the areas identified in the Scope.  We will use static analysis principles to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically consider potential attack vectors and how they might exploit weaknesses in the code.  This will involve creating attack trees and scenarios.
3.  **Dependency Analysis:**  We will examine the dependencies of `ownCloud/core` to identify any known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that could impact the sharing and permissions mechanisms.
4.  **Review of Existing Documentation:**  We will review the official ownCloud documentation, developer guides, and any existing security audits or vulnerability reports related to sharing and permissions.
5.  **Fuzzing (Conceptual):** While we won't perform live fuzzing as part of this document, we will *describe* how fuzzing could be used to test the robustness of the input validation and parsing logic.
6.  **Unit and Integration Test Analysis:** We will examine existing unit and integration tests to assess their coverage of the sharing and permissions logic.  We will identify gaps in test coverage.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Based on the defined scope and methodology, we can now delve into the specific areas of concern:

**2.1 Sharing Logic:**

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **ID Enumeration:**  If share IDs are predictable (e.g., sequential), an attacker might be able to guess valid share IDs and access files they shouldn't.
    *   **Race Conditions:**  Concurrent requests to modify share settings could lead to inconsistent states and potentially bypass permission checks.  This is particularly relevant for user-to-user and group sharing.
    *   **Logic Errors in Share Revocation:**  If a share is revoked, but the underlying file permissions are not updated correctly, the file might still be accessible.
    *   **Token Handling Issues (Public Links):**  Weak token generation, predictable tokens, or improper token validation could allow unauthorized access to publicly shared files.
    *   **Improper Handling of Expired Shares:** If expired shares are not properly handled, they might still be accessible.
    *   **Database Schema Weaknesses:**  Incorrectly defined relationships or constraints in the database schema could lead to inconsistencies and unauthorized access.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Examine the code responsible for generating share IDs and tokens.  Look for randomness and unpredictability.
    *   Analyze the code that handles share creation, modification, and revocation.  Look for potential race conditions and ensure proper synchronization.
    *   Review the database schema related to shares (e.g., `oc_share`, `oc_share_external`).  Check for proper constraints and relationships.
    *   Search for any code that directly interacts with file system permissions.  Ensure that these permissions are updated correctly when shares are created or revoked.

*   **Threat Modeling (Example Scenario):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Access a file shared with a specific user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to brute-force share IDs, assuming they are sequential.
    *   **Exploitation:** If the attacker guesses a valid share ID, they can access the file without proper authorization.

**2.2 Permissions Model (ACLs):**

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Incorrect ACL Evaluation:**  Bugs in the logic that evaluates ACLs could lead to incorrect permission checks, granting access where it should be denied.
    *   **ACL Bypass:**  Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to bypass the ACL checks entirely, perhaps through injection attacks or by manipulating internal data structures.
    *   **Default Permissions Issues:**  If default permissions are too permissive, newly created files or shares might be accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Inheritance Problems:**  If permissions are inherited from parent folders, errors in the inheritance logic could lead to incorrect permissions.
    *   **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Issues:**  A race condition where permissions are checked, then the file is accessed, but the permissions change in between.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Identify the core functions responsible for evaluating ACLs (e.g., functions that check user permissions against file metadata).  Thoroughly analyze these functions for logic errors.
    *   Look for any code that modifies ACLs.  Ensure that these modifications are performed atomically and consistently.
    *   Examine how default permissions are applied to new files and shares.
    *   Review the code that handles permission inheritance.
    *   Search for potential TOCTOU vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat Modeling (Example Scenario):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Access a file they don't have permission to read.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits a bug in the ACL evaluation logic that causes it to incorrectly grant read access.
    *   **Exploitation:** The attacker can read the file's contents, even though they should not have permission.

**2.3 API Authorization Logic:**

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authorization Checks:**  API endpoints that should require authorization might be missing checks, allowing unauthenticated or unauthorized access.
    *   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**  Authorization checks might be present but not sufficiently strict, allowing users with limited privileges to perform actions they shouldn't.
    *   **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA/IDOR):**  An attacker can manipulate object identifiers (e.g., file IDs, share IDs) in API requests to access objects they don't own.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:**  Vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to bypass authentication entirely, potentially gaining access to the API as a privileged user.
    *   **Rate Limiting Issues:**  Lack of rate limiting on API endpoints could allow attackers to brute-force credentials or share IDs.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Identify all API endpoints related to file access, sharing, and permissions management.  Ensure that each endpoint has appropriate authorization checks.
    *   Examine the code that performs authorization checks.  Look for potential bypasses and ensure that the checks are sufficiently strict.
    *   Specifically look for places where user-supplied object identifiers are used to access data.  Ensure that proper ownership checks are performed.
    *   Check for the presence of rate limiting mechanisms.

*   **Threat Modeling (Example Scenario):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Access a file shared with another user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker modifies the file ID in an API request to point to a file they don't own.
    *   **Exploitation:** If the API endpoint lacks proper authorization checks (BOLA/IDOR), the attacker can access the file.

**2.4 Input Validation and Sanitization:**

*   **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal:**  If user-supplied file paths are not properly sanitized, an attacker might be able to access files outside the intended directory (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).
    *   **SQL Injection:**  If user input is used to construct SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization, an attacker might be able to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  While less directly related to file access, XSS vulnerabilities in the sharing interface could allow an attacker to steal session cookies or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** If ownCloud processes XML data related to sharing or permissions, XXE vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files or perform other attacks.
    *   **Command Injection:** If user input is used to construct shell commands, an attacker might be able to inject malicious commands.

*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Identify all places where user-supplied input is used to access files, interact with the database, or generate output.
    *   Ensure that proper input validation and sanitization techniques are used (e.g., whitelisting, escaping, parameterization).
    *   Look for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.  Ensure that file paths are properly validated and normalized.
    *   Search for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Ensure that all database queries are properly parameterized.
    *   Check for potential XSS vulnerabilities in the sharing interface.
    *   If XML processing is used, look for potential XXE vulnerabilities.
    *   Search for any code that executes shell commands based on user input.

*   **Threat Modeling (Example Scenario):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Access system files outside the ownCloud data directory.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker provides a malicious file path (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) in a request to access a shared file.
    *   **Exploitation:** If the application does not properly sanitize the file path, the attacker can access the system file.

**2.5 Fuzzing (Conceptual):**

Fuzzing can be a powerful technique to identify vulnerabilities in input validation and parsing logic.  Here's how it could be applied:

*   **Target:** API endpoints related to file access, sharing, and permissions management.  Also, any functions that process user-supplied file paths, share IDs, or permission settings.
*   **Fuzzing Input:** Generate a large number of malformed or unexpected inputs, including:
    *   Invalid file paths (e.g., containing special characters, path traversal sequences).
    *   Invalid share IDs (e.g., non-numeric values, excessively long strings).
    *   Invalid permission settings (e.g., non-boolean values, unexpected combinations).
    *   Large or excessively long strings.
    *   Unicode characters.
    *   Null bytes.
    *   Boundary values (e.g., very large or very small numbers).
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor the application for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior.  Any such behavior could indicate a vulnerability.

**2.6 Unit and Integration Test Analysis:**

*   **Review Existing Tests:** Examine the existing unit and integration tests for `ownCloud/core`.  Look for tests that specifically cover the sharing and permissions logic.
*   **Identify Gaps:** Identify areas of the code that are not adequately covered by tests.  This might include:
    *   Edge cases and complex scenarios.
    *   Error handling.
    *   Race conditions.
    *   Input validation.
    *   API authorization.
*   **Prioritize New Tests:**  Prioritize the creation of new tests to address the identified gaps.  Focus on tests that simulate potential attack vectors.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Based on the analysis above, here are detailed mitigation strategies, building upon the initial suggestions:

*   **3.1 Robust Input Validation and Sanitization (Core):**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Whenever possible, use a whitelist approach to validate user input.  Define a set of allowed characters or patterns and reject any input that does not match.  This is more secure than a blacklist approach.
    *   **Path Normalization:**  Before using any user-supplied file path, normalize it to remove any `.` or `..` sequences.  Use a dedicated library function for path normalization to ensure consistency and avoid errors.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions.  This prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.  *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating user input.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode any user-supplied data that is displayed in the user interface to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Use a context-aware encoding function (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
    *   **XML Parser Hardening:** If XML processing is used, configure the XML parser to disable external entities and DTDs to prevent XXE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Avoid Shell Commands:**  Avoid using shell commands based on user input whenever possible.  If shell commands are necessary, use a secure API that prevents command injection (e.g., by properly escaping arguments).

*   **3.2 Secure Sharing Logic:**
    *   **Cryptographically Secure Random Share IDs:**  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate share IDs and tokens.  Ensure that the IDs are sufficiently long and unpredictable.
    *   **Atomic Operations:**  Use atomic operations or database transactions to ensure that share creation, modification, and revocation are performed consistently, even under concurrent access.
    *   **Proper Share Revocation:**  When a share is revoked, ensure that all associated permissions are updated correctly.  This might involve updating database records and file system permissions.
    *   **Expiration Handling:**  Implement proper handling for expired shares.  Ensure that expired shares are automatically revoked and that the associated files are no longer accessible.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on share creation and access to prevent brute-force attacks.

*   **3.3 Strengthened ACL Enforcement:**
    *   **Formal Access Control Model:**  Consider using a formal access control model (e.g., RBAC, ABAC) to define and enforce permissions.  This can help to ensure consistency and reduce errors.
    *   **Thorough ACL Evaluation Logic:**  Carefully review and test the ACL evaluation logic to ensure that it correctly handles all possible cases.  Consider using a formal verification technique to prove the correctness of the logic.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege.  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly audit the ACL configuration and the code that enforces it to identify and fix any vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation for TOCTOU:** Use file locking or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent TOCTOU vulnerabilities.

*   **3.4 API Security Enhancements:**
    *   **Mandatory Authorization Checks:**  Ensure that *all* API endpoints that access or modify sensitive data have proper authorization checks.  Use a consistent authorization framework throughout the API.
    *   **Object-Level Authorization:**  Implement object-level authorization checks to ensure that users can only access objects they own or have permission to access.  This prevents BOLA/IDOR vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation (API Level):**  Perform input validation on all API requests, even if the data is also validated at a lower level.  This provides an additional layer of defense.
    *   **Rate Limiting (API Level):**  Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Authentication Security:** Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) and protect against authentication bypass vulnerabilities.

*   **3.5 Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Write comprehensive unit tests to cover all aspects of the sharing and permissions logic, including edge cases and error handling.
    *   **Integration Tests:**  Write integration tests to verify that the different components of the system work together correctly.
    *   **Security Tests:**  Write specific security tests to simulate potential attack vectors and verify that the system is resistant to them.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing to test the robustness of the input validation and parsing logic.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other testing methods.

*   **3.6 Dependency Management:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep all dependencies up to date to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use a vulnerability scanner to identify any known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Review:**  Carefully review any new dependencies before adding them to the project.

*   **3.7 Secure Configuration:**
    *   **Secure Defaults:**  Provide secure default settings for all configuration options related to sharing and permissions.
    *   **Documentation:**  Clearly document all configuration options and their security implications.

*   **3.8 Security Audits:**
    *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the `ownCloud/core` codebase, focusing on the sharing and permissions mechanisms.
    *   **Independent Audits:** Consider engaging an independent security firm to conduct periodic audits.

*   **3.9 Incident Response Plan:**
    *   **Develop a Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to handle any security incidents related to unauthorized file access.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the "Unauthorized File Access (Sharing & Permissions)" attack surface in `ownCloud/core`. By implementing these mitigation strategies and continuously monitoring for vulnerabilities, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. The key is a proactive, defense-in-depth approach that combines secure coding practices, rigorous testing, and ongoing security audits.
