# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for owncloud/core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Core)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__core_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Core Input Points:** Within the `core` repository, pinpoint all locations where user-supplied data enters the application logic. This is *crucially* different from the previous, broader list, as we're focusing *only* on the `core` components. Examples within `core` might include:
        *   Core API endpoints defined within `core`.
        *   Internal functions within `core` that handle file paths, user IDs, or other data ultimately derived from user input.
        *   Database query construction within `core` (even if abstracted).
        *   Configuration settings read and processed within `core`.
    2.  **Define Core-Specific Whitelists:** For each identified input point *within core*, define strict whitelists of allowed characters or data formats.  These whitelists should be as restrictive as possible.
    3.  **Implement Validation in Core:** Use PHP's `filter_var()` and custom validation functions *within the core codebase* to validate all inputs against the defined whitelists.  Reject any invalid input *before* it's used in any further processing.
    4.  **Implement Sanitization in Core:** After validation, sanitize the input within `core` using appropriate `filter_var()` sanitization filters.  Prioritize validation over sanitization.
    5.  **Layered Validation (Within Core):** If `core` has multiple layers of abstraction, implement validation at *each* layer where user-derived data is handled.  Don't assume that a lower layer has already validated the input.
    6.  **Regular Expression Review (Core):** Carefully review all regular expressions used within `core` for input validation to prevent ReDoS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (High Severity):**  If `core` handles file paths, this prevents accessing files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** If `core` generates any HTML output, this reduces the risk (output encoding is still the primary defense, but this adds a layer).
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injection of PHP code or other executable code through input handled within `core`.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Can help prevent some DoS attacks by limiting input lengths within `core`.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Severity):** If `core` makes external requests based on user input, this is critical.

*   **Impact:** (Same as previous, but focused on the impact within `core`'s responsibilities)
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within `core`).
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (within `core`).
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within `core`).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (for input-related DoS within `core`).
    *   **SSRF:** Risk reduced from High to Low (if applicable within `core`).

*   **Currently Implemented (Likely/Partially - Core):**
    *   Some level of input validation is likely present in core API handlers.
    *   Database interactions within `core` likely use prepared statements (see below).

*   **Missing Implementation (Potential Areas - Core):**
    *   Consistent and comprehensive validation across *all* core input points.
    *   Sufficiently strict whitelisting.
    *   Layered validation within `core`'s internal functions.
    *   Thorough review of regular expressions for ReDoS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Type Verification (Core)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_type_verification__core_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Core File Handling:** Identify all locations within the `core` repository where file uploads or file processing occurs. This might involve core file storage logic, or internal functions that handle file metadata.
    2.  **Avoid MIME Type Reliance (Core):** Ensure that `core` code *never* relies solely on the MIME type provided by the client for file type determination.
    3.  **File Signature Analysis (Core):** Implement file signature analysis (magic bytes) using PHP's `finfo_file()` *within the core codebase* to determine the true file type.
    4.  **Core Whitelist:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed file extensions *and* corresponding magic byte signatures *within core*, or in a configuration file loaded by `core`.
    5.  **Verification in Core:** The verification process (reading file bytes, comparing to the whitelist) must be implemented *within the core codebase*.
    6.  **Archive Handling (Core):** If `core` handles archive extraction or processing, implement size limits, content scanning, and file type restrictions *within core*.
    7.  **Executable File Restrictions (Core):**  Implement strict restrictions on executable file types within `core`'s file handling logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **File Upload Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents uploading malicious files disguised as other types, if `core` handles file uploads.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Reduces XSS risk if `core` handles file uploads that could contain malicious HTML.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (High Severity):** Prevents execution of malicious code uploaded through `core`'s file handling.

*   **Impact:** (Focused on `core`'s responsibilities)
    *   **File Upload Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within `core`).
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (within `core`).
    *   **RCE:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within `core`).

*   **Currently Implemented (Likely/Partially - Core):**
    *   May be present in core file storage logic, but might be incomplete or rely on less secure methods.

*   **Missing Implementation (Potential Areas - Core):**
    *   Consistent application across all `core` file handling functions.
    *   Robust handling of archive files within `core`.
    *   Primary reliance on file signature analysis (magic bytes) within `core`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries (Core)](./mitigation_strategies/prepared_statements_and_parameterized_queries__core_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Core Database Interactions:** Identify *all* database interactions within the `core` repository.
    2.  **PDO Usage (Core):** Ensure that `core` uses PHP's PDO (or a demonstrably secure equivalent) for all database access.
    3.  **No Concatenation (Core):**  Absolutely *no* direct concatenation of user-supplied data into SQL queries within `core`.
    4.  **Prepared Statements (Core):**  Use prepared statements with placeholders and `bindParam()`/`bindValue()` for *every* database query within `core`.
    5.  **Code Audit (Core):**  Thoroughly audit all `core` code that interacts with the database to confirm the consistent use of prepared statements.
    6. **ORM Usage Review (Core):** If an ORM is used within `core`, verify that it *correctly* uses prepared statements and doesn't have any known vulnerabilities that could lead to SQL injection.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical Severity):**  Completely prevents SQL injection attacks targeting database interactions *managed by core*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible (within `core`).

*   **Currently Implemented (Likely/Partially - Core):**
    *   ownCloud `core` likely uses PDO and prepared statements in most database interactions.

*   **Missing Implementation (Potential Areas - Core):**
    *   Older parts of the `core` codebase.
    *   Any custom SQL queries that bypass the standard database abstraction layer.
    *   Stored procedures used by `core` (need separate review).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Encoding (Context-Specific) (Core)](./mitigation_strategies/output_encoding__context-specific___core_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Core Output Points:** Identify all locations within the `core` repository where user-supplied or user-influenced data is included in output sent to the client (e.g., API responses, HTML fragments).
    2.  **Context-Specific Encoding (Core):**  Use the appropriate encoding function *within core* based on the output context:
        *   **HTML:** `htmlspecialchars()` with appropriate flags.
        *   **JavaScript:** A dedicated JavaScript encoding function.
        *   **URLs:** `urlencode()` or a robust URL encoding library.
    3.  **Templating Engine (Core):** If `core` uses a templating engine, ensure it's configured for automatic and context-aware output encoding.
    4.  **Double Encoding Prevention (Core):**  Implement checks within `core` to avoid double encoding.
    5. **API Responses (Core):** Ensure that API responses generated by `core` properly encode data, especially if returning JSON or XML.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents XSS attacks if `core` generates any output containing user data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (within `core`'s output generation).

*   **Currently Implemented (Likely/Partially - Core):**
    *   `core` likely has some output encoding, especially in API responses.

*   **Missing Implementation (Potential Areas - Core):**
    *   Consistent encoding across *all* `core` output points.
    *   Correct context-specific encoding.
    *   Double encoding issues.
