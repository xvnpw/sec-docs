# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes:
  - File storage and access: Ensuring users can reliably store and access their files.
  - File sharing and collaboration: Enabling users to securely share and collaborate on files.
  - User authentication and authorization: Controlling access to the platform and data.
  - Data synchronization: Keeping files synchronized across devices.
- Data sensitivity:
  - User files: Sensitivity varies depending on the user and organization. Can range from public documents to highly confidential business data, personal information, financial records, etc. Sensitivity is generally considered high due to the potential for storing diverse and sensitive data.
  - User credentials: Highly sensitive. Compromise can lead to unauthorized access to user data.
  - Metadata: Can contain sensitive information about file ownership, sharing, and access patterns. Sensitivity is medium to high depending on the context.
  - System logs: Can contain sensitive information about system activity and potential security incidents. Sensitivity is medium to high.
