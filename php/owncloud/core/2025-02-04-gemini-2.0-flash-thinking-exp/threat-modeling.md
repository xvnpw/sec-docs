# Threat Model Analysis for owncloud/core

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Session Fixation](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_session_fixation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into using a pre-existing session ID they control. If ownCloud core fails to properly regenerate session IDs after login or is vulnerable to session fixation, the attacker can hijack the user's session upon login, gaining unauthorized access to their account.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user account and data, potential data theft, modification, or deletion.
* **Affected Core Component:** Session Management module, Authentication module.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Ensure session IDs are regenerated upon successful login and privilege elevation.
        * Implement strong session ID generation (cryptographically secure random numbers).
        * Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.
        * Implement proper session timeout and invalidation.
    * **Users/Administrators:**
        * Use HTTPS for all connections to ownCloud.
        * Educate users about the risks of suspicious links.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through RBAC Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_rbac_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker with a low-privileged user account exploits a flaw in ownCloud core's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This could involve manipulating API requests or exploiting logic errors in permission checks. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to elevate their privileges to administrator or other higher-level roles.
* **Impact:** Full system compromise, unauthorized access to all data, ability to modify system configurations, potential takeover of the ownCloud instance.
* **Affected Core Component:** RBAC module, User Management module, Permission Check functions.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Thoroughly review and test RBAC implementation for logic flaws.
        * Implement principle of least privilege in code and access control design.
        * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements in permission checks.
        * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing on RBAC.
    * **Administrators:**
        * Regularly review user roles and permissions.
        * Follow security best practices for user account management.
        * Apply security updates promptly.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during File Upload](./threats/path_traversal_during_file_upload.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious filename or path during file upload. If ownCloud core doesn't properly sanitize file paths, the attacker could write files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem, potentially overwriting system files or uploading executable code.
* **Impact:** Remote code execution, unauthorized file access, system compromise, denial of service.
* **Affected Core Component:** File Upload module, File Handling functions, Path Sanitization functions.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for filenames and paths during file upload.
        * Use secure file handling APIs and functions to prevent path traversal.
        * Chroot file upload processes or use sandboxing.
        * Enforce strict file type restrictions and validation.
    * **Administrators:**
        * Configure web server and OS with least privilege principles.
        * Regularly monitor file system for unauthorized file modifications.

## Threat: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure File Handling](./threats/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_insecure_file_handling.md)

* **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., HTML with JavaScript). If ownCloud core doesn't properly sanitize file content when displaying or processing files (previews, sharing interfaces, editors), the malicious script can execute in another user's browser when they access the file.
* **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, defacement, redirection to malicious websites.
* **Affected Core Component:** File Preview module, File Sharing module, Online Editors (if integrated in core), Output Encoding functions.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement robust output encoding and escaping for all user-generated content, especially file content and metadata.
        * Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
        * Sanitize or disable HTML rendering in file previews where possible.
        * Regularly scan for and patch XSS vulnerabilities.
    * **Administrators:**
        * Enable and configure CSP headers in the web server.
        * Educate users about risks of opening files from untrusted sources.
