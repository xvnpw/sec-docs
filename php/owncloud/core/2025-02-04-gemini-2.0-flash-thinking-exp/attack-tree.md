## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise OwnCloud Application via Core Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_owncloud_application_via_core_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal. It represents any successful attack that leverages weaknesses within the OwnCloud Core to gain control or access to the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Vulnerabilities in Core [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_vulnerabilities_in_core__critical_node_.md)

* This category encompasses attacks that directly exploit flaws in the programming code of OwnCloud Core. These flaws can be bugs, oversights, or insecure coding practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection Attacks [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_attacks__critical_node_.md)

* This is a class of vulnerabilities where attackers inject malicious code into the application, which is then executed by the server or client.
        * **SQL Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL queries into input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized before being used in database queries.
            * **Potential Impact:** Data exfiltration, data modification, authentication bypass, and in some cases, remote command execution on the database server.
        * **Command Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious system commands into input fields or parameters that are used by the application to execute system commands.
            * **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, usually JavaScript, into web pages viewed by other users.
        * **Stored XSS [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts that are stored on the server (e.g., in the database, file system) and then executed when other users access the stored data.
            * **Potential Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
        * **Reflected XSS [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into URLs or form submissions that are reflected back by the server and executed in the user's browser.
            * **Potential Impact:** Credential theft, redirection to malicious sites, and website defacement.
        * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Tricking a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the application by crafting malicious requests.
            * **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized changes to user settings, data modification, privilege escalation, and in some cases, account takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* These vulnerabilities relate to flaws in how the application verifies user identity and manages access permissions.
        * **Authentication Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the login process or authentication mechanisms to gain access to the application without valid credentials.
            * **Potential Impact:** Full unauthorized access to the application and its data.
        * **Authorization Bypass (Privilege Escalation) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the access control logic to gain access to resources or functionalities that the attacker is not authorized to access (e.g., accessing admin panels as a regular user).
            * **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative control over the application, and potential for further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/file_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* These vulnerabilities arise from insecure handling of files by the application.
        * **Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Manipulating file paths to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially including sensitive system files or application source code.
            * **Potential Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, and in some cases, remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., log poisoning).
        * **Arbitrary File Upload [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Uploading malicious files, such as webshells, to the server by bypassing file type restrictions or other security checks.
            * **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/api_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* Vulnerabilities specifically targeting the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) exposed by OwnCloud Core.
        * **API Authentication/Authorization Flaws [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in how APIs are authenticated and authorized, allowing unauthorized access to API endpoints.
            * **Potential Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption, and potential for further compromise through API access.
        * **API Input Validation Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting insufficient input validation in API endpoints, leading to injection attacks or denial of service.
            * **Potential Impact:** Injection vulnerabilities via APIs (SQL, command, etc.), denial of service attacks, and other API-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Core Features/Functionality in Unintended Ways](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_core_featuresfunctionality_in_unintended_ways.md)

* **Privilege Escalation via Feature Abuse [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Misusing intended features of OwnCloud Core, such as sharing or permission management, in a way that leads to unintended privilege escalation.
        * **Potential Impact:** A regular user gaining administrative privileges or access to other users' data by exploiting the logic of a legitimate feature.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses in Core Deployment [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_in_core_deployment__critical_node_.md)

* Taking advantage of insecure configurations in the deployed OwnCloud Core instance.
        * **Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting default settings that are insecure, such as weak default passwords, exposed debug modes, or overly permissive default permissions.
            * **Potential Impact:** Initial access to the application, exposure of sensitive information, and easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
        * **Missing Security Headers [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Leveraging the absence of important security headers in HTTP responses to facilitate other attacks like clickjacking or XSS.
            * **Potential Impact:** Increased vulnerability to other attacks, reduced overall security posture.
        * **Insecure File Permissions [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting incorrect file system permissions on OwnCloud Core files and directories, allowing unauthorized access or modification.
            * **Potential Impact:** Access to sensitive configuration files, modification of core code, and potential for code execution if web server user has write access to web directories.
