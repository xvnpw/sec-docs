### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving ownCloud Core

This document outlines high and critical security threats directly introduced by the `owncloud/core` library.

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities *within the core's* authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to user accounts without valid credentials. This could involve bypassing login forms, exploiting flaws in session management *implemented by the core*, or circumventing two-factor authentication *within the core*.
    *   **Impact:** Full access to user accounts, including files, settings, and potentially administrative privileges. This can lead to data theft, modification, deletion, and impersonation.
    *   **Affected Component:** User Authentication Module, Session Management, Two-Factor Authentication Implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Implement robust and secure session management practices (e.g., HTTPOnly, Secure flags) *within the core*. Enforce strong password policies *within the core*. Implement and enforce multi-factor authentication *within the core*. Regularly review and patch authentication code *in the core*.

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with limited access could exploit flaws *in the core's* authorization mechanisms to gain higher privileges than intended. This could allow them to access or modify files, settings, or user accounts they should not have access to *within the ownCloud environment*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and administrative functions *within ownCloud*. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Permission Management Module, Access Control Lists (ACLs), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Implement granular and consistent permission checks throughout the core. Follow the principle of least privilege *within the core's permission system*. Regularly audit and review permission configurations *within the core*.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal in File Handling
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths during upload, download, or other file operations *handled by the core* to access files or directories outside of the intended user space. This could allow them to read sensitive system files or other users' data *managed by ownCloud*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files and directories on the server. Potential for arbitrary file read and in some cases, file write or execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** File Upload Handler, File Download Handler, File System Access Layer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Implement strict input validation and sanitization for file paths *within the core's file handling logic*. Use secure file path handling functions provided by the operating system or framework *when interacting with the file system from the core*. Employ chroot jails or similar techniques to restrict file system access *for the ownCloud process*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Processing Leading to Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker could upload a specially crafted file that, when processed *by the core* (e.g., for preview generation, thumbnail creation, or format conversion), exploits a vulnerability in the processing library *used by the core* to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands, install malware, and steal sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** File Preview Generation Module, Thumbnail Generation Module, Document Conversion Libraries (if used by the core).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Sanitize and validate file content before processing *within the core*. Use secure and up-to-date libraries for file processing *within the core*. Implement sandboxing or containerization for file processing tasks *performed by the core*. Disable unnecessary file processing features *within the core configuration*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Sharing Mechanisms
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities *in the core's* file and folder sharing features could allow unintended exposure of data. This could involve flaws in link sharing, permission inheritance, or group sharing mechanisms *implemented by the core*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files and folders *managed by ownCloud*. Potential data breaches and privacy violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Sharing API, Link Sharing Module, Group Management Module, Permission Inheritance Logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Implement robust access controls for shared resources *within the core*. Provide clear and understandable sharing options to users *through the core's interface*. Regularly review and audit sharing configurations *managed by the core*. Implement expiration dates for shared links *within the core functionality*.

*   **Threat:** API Vulnerabilities Allowing Unauthorized Actions
    *   **Description:** Security flaws *in the core's* internal or external APIs could be exploited to perform actions without proper authorization. This could include manipulating files, managing users, or changing settings *through the core's API*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or access to data and system configurations *within ownCloud*. Potential for data breaches, account takeover, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** REST API Endpoints, Internal API Functions, Authentication and Authorization Middleware for APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Implement proper authentication and authorization for all API endpoints *provided by the core*. Validate all input data received by the API *of the core*. Protect against common API vulnerabilities like injection attacks and broken authentication *within the core's API implementation*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Update Mechanisms
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities *in the core's* update process could allow attackers to inject malicious code during an update, potentially compromising the entire system.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands, install malware, and steal sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Update Manager, Package Verification Module, Download Mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers: Implement secure update mechanisms with cryptographic signature verification for updates *provided by ownCloud*. Use secure channels for downloading updates *for the core*.
