## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities in Core [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_authenticationauthorization_vulnerabilities_in_core__critical_.md)

*   This is a critical area as it controls access to the entire application and its data. Any successful exploitation here has a high impact.

    *   **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Exploit SQL Injection in Authentication Logic [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious SQL queries into login forms or API calls to bypass authentication checks.
            *   Why High-Risk: SQL injection is a well-known and often prevalent vulnerability. Successful exploitation grants immediate access to user accounts.
        *   **Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Attack Vector: Leveraging known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the core's authentication process that allow login without valid credentials.
            *   Why High-Risk: These vulnerabilities provide a direct and often easy way to bypass security measures entirely.

    *   **Elevate Privileges [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Attack Vector: Exploiting flaws in the core's permission system to gain higher privileges than authorized.
            *   Why High-Risk: Successful privilege escalation allows an attacker to perform actions they are not meant to, potentially gaining administrative control.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Data Storage and Access Vulnerabilities in Core:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_data_storage_and_access_vulnerabilities_in_core.md)

*   While various data access vulnerabilities exist, the injection of malicious content poses the highest risk.

    *   **Inject Malicious Content into Files [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Upload executable files (e.g., PHP, Python) [CRITICAL]:**
                *   Attack Vector: Uploading files containing malicious code that can be executed on the server.
                *   Why High-Risk: Successful execution of uploaded code can lead to full server compromise, allowing the attacker to control the system and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Application/Extension Management in Core:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_applicationextension_management_in_core.md)

*   The ability to install malicious applications poses a significant threat.

    *   **Install Malicious Applications/Extensions [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Exploit Lack of Signature Verification [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Attack Vector: Installing unsigned or tampered applications/extensions due to missing or weak signature verification in the core.
            *   Why High-Risk: This allows attackers to introduce backdoors or malicious functionality into the system through seemingly legitimate extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core Configuration and Deployment [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_core_configuration_and_deployment__critical_.md)

*   Weak configurations and exposed sensitive information are critical entry points.

    *   **Exploit Default or Weak Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
        *   Attack Vector: Using default administrator credentials or easily guessable passwords for the ownCloud instance.
        *   Why High-Risk: This is a very common and easily exploitable vulnerability that grants immediate administrative access.

    *   **Exploit Information Disclosure:**
        *   **Access Configuration Files with Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]:**
            *   Attack Vector: Obtaining database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data from configuration files due to insufficient protection by the core.
            *   Why High-Risk: Access to these credentials can lead to the compromise of other systems and data connected to the ownCloud instance.
