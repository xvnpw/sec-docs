*   Software developers contributing to or integrating with the ownCloud Core codebase.
*   System administrators involved in the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of ownCloud instances.
*   Technical stakeholders requiring a comprehensive understanding of the ownCloud Core system architecture.

### 4. System Architecture

ownCloud Core employs a multi-layered architecture, with each layer responsible for specific functionalities.

*   **Client Tier:**  Represents the various interfaces users interact with:
    *   **Web Interface:** A browser-based interface providing access to files and features.
    *   **Desktop Sync Clients:** Native applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux that synchronize files between local devices and the ownCloud server.
    *   **Mobile Apps:** Applications for Android and iOS devices enabling file access and synchronization on mobile platforms.
    *   **WebDAV Interface:** Allows third-party applications and services to interact with ownCloud using the WebDAV protocol.
    *   **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Provides command-line access for administrative tasks and scripting.

*   **Presentation Tier (Web Server):** Handles incoming client requests and manages communication:
    *   **Web Server Software:** Typically Apache or Nginx, responsible for serving static content and proxying requests to the application layer.
    *   **SSL/TLS Termination:** Handles secure communication over HTTPS.

*   **Application Tier (PHP Application):** Contains the core business logic and functionalities:
    *   **Authentication Module:** Manages user login and authentication processes (e.g., username/password, OAuth2, LDAP).
    *   **Authorization Module:** Enforces access control policies, determining user permissions for files and folders.
    *   **File Management Module:** Handles operations like upload, download, rename, delete, and versioning of files.
    *   **Sharing Module:** Manages the creation, modification, and revocation of file and folder shares.
    *   **User and Group Management Module:**  Handles the creation, modification, and management of user accounts and groups.
    *   **App Management Module:**  Provides the functionality to install, update, and manage optional applications.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Exposes RESTful APIs for client applications and third-party integrations.
    *   **Activity Logging:** Records user actions and system events for auditing and monitoring.
    *   **Notification System:** Manages and delivers notifications to users about relevant events.

*   **Data Persistence Tier:** Responsible for storing persistent data:
    *   **Database System:** Stores metadata about files, users, shares, and application settings. Common choices include MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
    *   **Storage Backend:** Manages the actual storage of user files. This can be:
        *   **Local File System:** Files are stored directly on the server's file system.
        *   **Object Storage:** Integration with object storage services like Amazon S3, OpenStack Swift, or Ceph.
        *   **Network File Systems:** Mounting network shares like NFS or SMB/CIFS.
        *   **External Storage Providers:** Connecting to external services like Dropbox or Google Drive (via apps).

*   **Background Processing Tier:** Handles asynchronous and scheduled tasks:
    *   **Background Workers:** Processes tasks like file version cleanup, trash management, and scheduled maintenance jobs.
    *   **Cron Jobs/Task Scheduler:**  Triggers scheduled tasks.
