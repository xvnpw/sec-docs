# Attack Surface Analysis for owncloud/core

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass via Custom Modules](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_via_custom_modules.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom authentication modules (e.g., LDAP, SAML integrations) can allow attackers to bypass the core authentication mechanisms.
*   **How Core Contributes:** The core provides an interface for integrating custom authentication modules. If this interface doesn't enforce strict security requirements or if the core doesn't adequately validate the responses from these modules, bypasses can occur.
*   **Example:** A poorly implemented SAML integration might not correctly validate the signature of the assertion, allowing an attacker to forge a valid login.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts, access to sensitive data, potential for further attacks on the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement rigorous security reviews and testing for all custom authentication modules. The core should provide clear guidelines and security checks for module developers. Implement strong validation of authentication responses.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal during File Operations](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_during_file_operations.md)

**Description:** Improper sanitization of file paths during upload, download, or sharing operations can allow attackers to access or manipulate files outside of their intended scope.
*   **How Core Contributes:** The core handles file path construction and processing. If the core doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input (e.g., filenames, share paths), attackers can inject malicious path components.
*   **Example:** An attacker could craft a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd` during an upload, potentially overwriting system files if the core doesn't prevent traversal.
*   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential for arbitrary file read/write, leading to data breaches or system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data related to file paths. Use secure file path handling functions provided by the operating system or framework. Employ chroot jails or similar techniques to restrict file access.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Public Link Generation](./attack_surfaces/insecure_public_link_generation.md)

**Description:** Predictable or easily guessable public share links can allow unauthorized access to shared files and folders.
*   **How Core Contributes:** The core is responsible for generating and managing public share links. If the link generation algorithm is weak or predictable, attackers can enumerate valid links.
*   *Example:** If public share links are generated using a simple sequential ID, an attacker could easily guess other valid share links.*
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to shared data, potential data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement cryptographically secure random number generators for generating share link tokens. Use sufficiently long and complex tokens. Consider adding expiration dates and password protection to public links.

## Attack Surface: [API Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Insufficient validation of input data to API endpoints can lead to various vulnerabilities, including injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
*   **How Core Contributes:** The core exposes various API endpoints for different functionalities. If the core doesn't properly validate the data received by these endpoints, attackers can inject malicious payloads.
*   *Example:** An API endpoint for creating a new user might be vulnerable to SQL injection if user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.*
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential for remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Avoid directly executing user-supplied data as commands. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation through Permission Management Flaws](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_through_permission_management_flaws.md)

**Description:** Bugs in the core's permission management logic can allow lower-privileged users to gain access to resources or functionalities they are not authorized to access.
*   **How Core Contributes:** The core is responsible for enforcing access control policies. If there are flaws in how permissions are assigned, checked, or inherited, privilege escalation can occur.
*   *Example:** A bug might allow a regular user to modify the permissions of a shared folder, granting themselves administrative access to its contents.*
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for data modification or deletion, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement thorough testing of the permission management system, including edge cases and inheritance scenarios. Follow the principle of least privilege. Regularly audit the permission model.
