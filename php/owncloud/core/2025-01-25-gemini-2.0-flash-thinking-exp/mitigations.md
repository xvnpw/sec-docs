# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for owncloud/core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement and Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_and_enforce_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Enable MFA Apps:** Within the ownCloud admin interface, navigate to the "Apps" section and enable the "Two-Factor Authentication" app (or specific MFA provider apps like "Two-Factor TOTP provider" or "Two-Factor WebAuthn").
2.  **Configure MFA Providers:** Access the "Security" settings in the admin interface. Configure the enabled MFA providers. For example, for TOTP, no specific configuration might be needed beyond enabling the app. For WebAuthn, ensure the server meets the prerequisites.
3.  **Enforce MFA (Potentially via Apps):** ownCloud core itself might not have *global* enforcement policies. Enforcement might be achieved through specific MFA apps or by encouraging/mandating users to enable MFA. Some apps might offer features to enforce MFA for specific user groups or actions.
4.  **User Self-Enrollment:** Guide users to enable MFA in their user settings. ownCloud provides interfaces for users to set up TOTP or WebAuthn after logging in.
5.  **Recovery Codes:** Ensure users are aware of and can generate recovery codes during MFA setup in case they lose access to their primary MFA device.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** MFA significantly reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks against user passwords.
*   **Password Guessing/Compromise (High Severity):** Even if a password is compromised, MFA prevents unauthorized access without the second factor.
*   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** MFA makes account takeover much harder, requiring compromise of multiple authentication factors.
### Impact:
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Password Guessing/Compromise:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Account Takeover:** High Risk Reduction
### Currently Implemented:
Implemented in ownCloud core through the "Two-Factor Authentication" framework and specific provider apps like "Two-Factor TOTP provider" and "Two-Factor WebAuthn". Users can enable and configure MFA in their settings.
### Missing Implementation:
Global MFA enforcement policies directly within core might be limited or app-dependent.  More centralized admin control over MFA enforcement and reporting could be enhanced in core.  A wider range of built-in MFA providers directly within core (without relying on separate apps) could be considered.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Control User and Group Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_control_user_and_group_permissions.md)

### Description:
1.  **Define Groups:** In the ownCloud admin interface, create user groups that reflect different access levels and roles within the organization (e.g., "Administrators," "Editors," "Viewers," "Marketing Team").
2.  **Assign Users to Groups:** Assign users to the appropriate groups based on their roles and responsibilities.
3.  **Set Default Permissions:** Review and adjust default permissions for newly created files and folders. Consider setting restrictive defaults and granting access explicitly.
4.  **Configure Folder and File Permissions:** Utilize ownCloud's web interface or command-line tools (like `occ`) to set granular permissions on folders and files. Permissions include "Read," "Write," "Create," "Delete," "Share," and more. Assign permissions to groups or individual users as needed.
5.  **Manage Share Permissions:** When sharing files or folders, carefully configure share permissions (read-only, read-write, etc.) and expiration dates. Review and audit existing shares regularly.
6.  **External Share Control:**  Control external sharing capabilities through ownCloud admin settings. Limit or disable external sharing if not required or implement stricter controls.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Restricting permissions prevents users from accessing data they are not authorized to view or modify.
*   **Data Breaches due to Insider Threats (Medium to High Severity):** Limits the potential damage from malicious or negligent insiders by controlling their access to sensitive data.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Prevents users from gaining higher privileges than intended by enforcing role-based access control.
### Impact:
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Data Breaches due to Insider Threats:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction
### Currently Implemented:
Fully implemented in ownCloud core. ownCloud's core functionality includes a comprehensive user and group management system with granular permission controls at the folder and file level, accessible through the admin interface and `occ` command-line tool.
### Missing Implementation:
More advanced permission inheritance models or attribute-based access control (ABAC) are not directly built into core.  Automated permission auditing and reporting tools within core could be enhanced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor and Audit Authentication Attempts via ownCloud Logs](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_and_audit_authentication_attempts_via_owncloud_logs.md)

### Description:
1.  **Configure Log Level:** In ownCloud's `config.php` file, adjust the log level to capture sufficient authentication-related events. Ensure the log level is set to at least "INFO" or "DEBUG" to capture login attempts and errors.
2.  **Log File Location:** Identify the location of ownCloud's log files (typically within the `data/owncloud.log` directory, or as configured in `config.php`).
3.  **Log Analysis:** Regularly review ownCloud's log files for authentication-related events. Look for patterns like:
    *   `Login failed` messages with usernames and IP addresses.
    *   `Login successful` messages from unusual locations or at unusual times.
    *   Repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address (potential brute-force).
    *   Account lockouts due to failed login attempts.
4.  **Automated Log Parsing (External Tools):** While core doesn't have built-in automated alerting, use external log analysis tools (like `grep`, `awk`, or scripting languages) to parse ownCloud logs and identify suspicious authentication patterns.
5.  **Integrate with External SIEM (Optional):** For more advanced monitoring, integrate ownCloud logs with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system if available in your infrastructure. This is not a core feature but an integration possibility.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Log analysis can help detect brute-force attempts by identifying patterns of failed logins.
*   **Credential Stuffing Attacks (High Severity):** Unusual login patterns in logs can indicate credential stuffing.
*   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Logs can reveal unauthorized logins after an account compromise.
*   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Suspicious login activity by internal users can be identified through log review.
### Impact:
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction (Detection and potential manual response)
*   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction (Detection and potential manual response)
*   **Account Takeover:** Medium Risk Reduction (Detection and potential manual response)
*   **Insider Threats:** Medium Risk Reduction (Detection and Investigation)
### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented in ownCloud core. ownCloud core provides logging functionality, including logging of authentication events. Log files are generated and can be accessed by administrators.
### Missing Implementation:
Automated alerting and real-time monitoring of authentication events are not built-in core features.  Core lacks built-in log analysis tools or dashboards for authentication monitoring. Integration with SIEM systems requires external configuration and is not a core feature itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Enforce Encryption at Rest within ownCloud Core](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_enforce_encryption_at_rest_within_owncloud_core.md)

### Description:
1.  **Enable Encryption App:** In the ownCloud admin interface, navigate to the "Apps" section and enable the "Default encryption module" app.
2.  **Initial Encryption Setup:** After enabling the app, ownCloud will guide you through the initial encryption setup. This typically involves generating encryption keys.
3.  **Encryption Key Management:** ownCloud core manages encryption keys. Understand the key recovery mechanisms and ensure the master key (if applicable) is securely managed. Back up the encryption keys as instructed by ownCloud.
4.  **Encryption Scope:** Understand that ownCloud's default encryption module encrypts the *data* folder content. Metadata and database content are generally not encrypted by this module.
5.  **Performance Considerations:** Be aware that encryption at rest can have performance implications. Test and monitor performance after enabling encryption.
6.  **Disable Encryption (Carefully):** Disabling encryption after enabling it is a complex process and should be done with caution, following ownCloud's documentation to avoid data loss.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Data Breaches due to Physical Server Compromise (High Severity):** If the server or storage media is physically stolen, data remains encrypted and unreadable without the keys managed by ownCloud.
*   **Data Breaches due to Storage Backend Compromise (Medium to High Severity):** If the storage backend is compromised, the file content remains encrypted.
*   **Data Breaches by Unauthorized Internal Access to Storage (Medium Severity):** Encryption at rest adds a layer of protection against unauthorized internal access to the raw storage.
### Impact:
*   **Data Breaches due to Physical Server Compromise:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Data Breaches due to Storage Backend Compromise:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
*   **Data Breaches by Unauthorized Internal Access to Storage:** Medium Risk Reduction
### Currently Implemented:
Implemented in ownCloud core through the "Default encryption module" app. This app provides server-side encryption for data at rest and is configurable via the admin interface.
### Missing Implementation:
Integration with external Key Management Systems (KMS) directly within the core encryption module is limited.  More granular encryption policies (e.g., per-folder encryption, different encryption algorithms) are not core features.  Encryption of metadata and database content is not included in the default core encryption module.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement File Type Restrictions within ownCloud Core](./mitigation_strategies/implement_file_type_restrictions_within_owncloud_core.md)

### Description:
1.  **`config.php` Configuration:**  Modify the `config.php` file to define allowed or disallowed file extensions. Use the `check_for_forbidden_filenames` and `forbiden_filenames` configuration parameters to restrict file uploads based on filename patterns or extensions.
2.  **Define Forbidden Filenames/Extensions:** Specify patterns or extensions to block in the `forbiden_filenames` array in `config.php`.  This is a basic form of file type restriction.
3.  **Restart Web Server/PHP-FPM:** After modifying `config.php`, restart the web server or PHP-FPM service for the changes to take effect.
4.  **Testing:** Test the file type restrictions by attempting to upload files with forbidden extensions. Verify that ownCloud blocks these uploads.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Malware Upload and Distribution (Medium Severity):** Restricting executable file types (e.g., `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`) can reduce the risk of malware uploads.
*   **Phishing Attacks via File Uploads (Low to Medium Severity):**  Limits the ability to upload certain file types that might be used for phishing (e.g., `.html`, `.htm` - but this might also impact legitimate use cases).
*   **Accidental Upload of Unwanted File Types (Low Severity):** Can help enforce organizational policies regarding allowed file types.
### Impact:
*   **Malware Upload and Distribution:** Medium Risk Reduction (Limited, extension-based only)
*   **Phishing Attacks via File Uploads:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction (Limited, extension-based only)
*   **Accidental Upload of Unwanted File Types:** Low Risk Reduction
### Currently Implemented:
Implemented in ownCloud core through `config.php` configuration parameters like `check_for_forbidden_filenames` and `forbiden_filenames`. This provides a basic, extension-based file type restriction mechanism.
### Missing Implementation:
Content-based file type validation (checking file magic numbers or headers) is not implemented in core.  More user-friendly interfaces for managing file type restrictions (beyond direct `config.php` editing) are missing.  Granular control over file type restrictions per user or group is not a core feature.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update ownCloud Core](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_owncloud_core.md)

### Description:
1.  **Monitor ownCloud Release Channels:** Subscribe to ownCloud security advisories, mailing lists, or check the ownCloud website and GitHub repository for new releases and security announcements.
2.  **Plan Update Schedule:** Establish a regular schedule for updating ownCloud core. Consider testing updates in a staging environment before applying them to production.
3.  **Backup Before Update:** Always create a full backup of your ownCloud instance (database, data directory, configuration) before performing any updates.
4.  **Follow Update Procedures:** Follow the official ownCloud update documentation for your chosen update method (e.g., using the updater app, command-line tools like `occ upgrade`, or package managers).
5.  **Verify Update Success:** After updating, verify that the update was successful, and ownCloud is functioning correctly. Check the ownCloud logs for any errors.
6.  **Apply App Updates:** After core updates, also update ownCloud apps to ensure compatibility and benefit from any app security updates.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Known Vulnerabilities in ownCloud Core (High Severity):** Updates patch known security vulnerabilities in ownCloud core, preventing exploitation by attackers.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** While updates don't directly prevent zero-days, staying up-to-date reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before patches are available.
*   **Outdated Software Risks (High Severity):** Running outdated software increases the risk of various security issues and compatibility problems.
### Impact:
*   **Known Vulnerabilities in ownCloud Core:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Medium to High Risk Reduction (Reduced exposure window)
*   **Outdated Software Risks:** High Risk Reduction
### Currently Implemented:
The ability to update ownCloud core is inherently implemented. ownCloud provides update mechanisms like the updater app and command-line tools (`occ upgrade`).  Release channels and security advisories are also provided by the ownCloud project.
### Missing Implementation:
Automated update processes directly within core are limited.  More proactive notifications within the admin interface about available updates could be improved.  Automated testing of updates before deployment is not a core feature.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure ownCloud Core Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_owncloud_core_configuration.md)

### Description:
1.  **Review `config.php`:** Carefully review the `config.php` file and understand the purpose of each configuration parameter.
2.  **Secure Database Credentials:** Ensure database credentials in `config.php` are strong and securely stored. Restrict database user permissions to only what is necessary for ownCloud.
3.  **Disable Debug Mode:** Ensure `debug` mode is disabled (`'debug' => false,`) in `config.php` in production environments to prevent exposing sensitive information in error messages.
4.  **Configure `datadirectory` Location:**  Ensure the `datadirectory` is located outside the web server's document root to prevent direct web access to data files.
5.  **Review and Disable Unnecessary Apps:** Disable any ownCloud apps that are not actively used to reduce the attack surface.
6.  **Configure Security Headers (Web Server Level, but related to ownCloud):** While not directly in core, configure security headers in the web server (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy) to enhance security. This is often done in conjunction with ownCloud deployment.
7.  **Limit Access to `config.php`:** Restrict file system permissions on `config.php` to only allow read access by the web server user and administrators.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):**  Insecure configurations can expose sensitive information like database credentials or debug information.
*   **Unauthorized Access due to Default Credentials (Medium Severity):**  While ownCloud doesn't have default credentials, insecure configurations can lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking (Medium Severity):**  Properly configured security headers (at web server level, but relevant to ownCloud) can mitigate these attacks.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Proper `datadirectory` configuration helps prevent LFI risks.
### Impact:
*   **Information Disclosure:** Medium to High Risk Reduction
*   **Unauthorized Access due to Default Credentials:** Medium Risk Reduction (Not directly applicable, but configuration security is crucial)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking:** Medium Risk Reduction (Via related web server configuration)
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction
### Currently Implemented:
Securing ownCloud configuration is primarily the responsibility of the administrator, but ownCloud core provides configuration options in `config.php` and admin interface to facilitate secure setup.
### Missing Implementation:
Automated security configuration checks and recommendations within the admin interface could be improved in core.  A security hardening guide or checklist integrated into the admin panel would be beneficial.
