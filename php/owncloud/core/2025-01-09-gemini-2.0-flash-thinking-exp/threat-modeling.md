# Threat Model Analysis for owncloud/core

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a flaw in the core's authentication logic to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative privileges without providing valid credentials. This might involve manipulating authentication requests, exploiting logic errors, or leveraging default credentials (if any exist and are not changed).

**Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts, access to sensitive data, potential for data manipulation or deletion, and system takeover if administrative access is gained.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module (specifically functions related to login, session management, and credential verification).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Developers should rigorously review and test the authentication logic for any bypass vulnerabilities.
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional layer of security.
* Enforce strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.
* Regularly update the ownCloud Core to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in File Handling](./threats/path_traversal_in_file_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths provided to the core to access or modify files outside of the intended user directories. This could involve crafting malicious file paths with ".." sequences or other escape characters.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for reading configuration files, accessing other users' data, or even executing arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** File Management Module (specifically functions handling file uploads, downloads, and file path resolution).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Developers must implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths.
* Use secure file path handling functions provided by the operating system or framework.
* Implement chroot jails or similar mechanisms to restrict file system access.
* Regularly review and test file handling logic for path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/api_vulnerabilities_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the core's APIs (e.g., REST API) to access sensitive data without proper authorization. This could involve flaws in API authentication, authorization checks, or data filtering.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive user data, file contents, or system information.

**Affected Component:** API Modules (including authentication and authorization components within the API).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Developers must implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints.
* Carefully validate and sanitize all input received through the API.
* Follow secure API design principles (e.g., least privilege, rate limiting).
* Regularly audit and test the security of the core's APIs.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./threats/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit weaknesses in the core's update mechanism to inject malicious code during an update process. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities in the update verification process.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the ownCloud instance, potentially leading to data loss, data theft, or the installation of backdoors.

**Affected Component:** Update Module (specifically functions related to downloading, verifying, and applying updates).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Developers must ensure that updates are delivered over secure channels (HTTPS).
* Implement strong cryptographic verification of update packages to ensure integrity and authenticity.
* Provide clear instructions and warnings to users about the importance of applying updates from trusted sources.
