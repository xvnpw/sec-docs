# Attack Surface Analysis for owncloud/core

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** The core allows users to upload files, and insufficient validation of file content, type, or name can lead to security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Core Contributes to Attack Surface:** The core's file upload handling mechanisms, including the API endpoints and processing logic, are responsible for validating uploaded files. Weak or missing validation in this part of the core directly introduces this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image. If the core doesn't properly validate the file content, this script could be executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if malicious HTML or JavaScript is uploaded and served.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by uploading excessively large files or files that consume significant server resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer Mitigation:**
        *   Implement robust server-side validation of file content, not just the declared MIME type. Use libraries or techniques like magic number checks.
        *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities and other injection attacks.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location where server-side scripts cannot be executed.
        *   Implement file size limits.
        *   Use virus scanning tools on uploaded files.
    *   **User Mitigation:** Be cautious about uploading sensitive information and understand the potential risks of sharing files.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in File Operations](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_file_operations.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the core handles file paths during operations like download, preview, or deletion can allow attackers to access or manipulate files outside their intended scope.
*   **How Core Contributes to Attack Surface:** The core's code responsible for resolving and accessing files based on user input (e.g., file paths in API requests) is the source of this vulnerability if it doesn't properly sanitize or validate these paths.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL or API request with a manipulated file path (e.g., `../../config/config.php`) to download sensitive configuration files from the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive files and configuration data.
    *   Potential for arbitrary file deletion or modification.
    *   Information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strict path sanitization using functions like `realpath()` or similar to resolve and canonicalize paths before accessing files.
        *   Enforce chroot-like restrictions or use secure file access APIs provided by the operating system or storage backend.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
    *   **User Mitigation:** Be cautious about clicking on untrusted links or downloading files from unknown sources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in how the core manages user sessions can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **How Core Contributes to Attack Surface:** The core's authentication and session management components are responsible for generating, storing, and validating session identifiers. Flaws in these mechanisms directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:**
    *   The core uses predictable session IDs, allowing an attacker to guess a valid session ID and hijack a user's session.
    *   The session cookie lacks the `HttpOnly` flag, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   The session cookie lacks the `Secure` flag, transmitting it over unencrypted HTTP connections.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover.
    *   Unauthorized access to user data.
    *   Malicious actions performed under the guise of a legitimate user.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer Mitigation:**
        *   Generate cryptographically strong and unpredictable session IDs.
        *   Implement proper session expiration and invalidation mechanisms.
        *   Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies.
        *   Consider using techniques like session regeneration after login.
        *   Protect against session fixation attacks.
    *   **User Mitigation:** Use strong, unique passwords and avoid using ownCloud on untrusted networks.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Logic flaws in the core's permission checking mechanisms can allow users to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized to.
*   **How Core Contributes to Attack Surface:** The core's code that enforces access control policies and determines user permissions is responsible for preventing unauthorized access. Bugs or inconsistencies in this code create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A user with read-only permissions is able to modify a shared file due to a flaw in how the core checks write permissions for shared resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   Data modification or deletion by unauthorized users.
    *   Privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer Mitigation:**
        *   Implement a robust and consistent authorization model.
        *   Thoroughly test all permission checks and access control logic.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly review and audit access controls.
    *   **User Mitigation:** Report any unexpected access or permission issues to system administrators.
