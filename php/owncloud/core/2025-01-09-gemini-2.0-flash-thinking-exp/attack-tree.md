## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via ownCloud Core Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_owncloud_core_weaknesses.md)

* This is the overarching goal. Success here means an attacker has achieved unauthorized access or control due to vulnerabilities in ownCloud Core.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_in_core.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (e.g., CVE):**  Leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities in ownCloud Core's authentication mechanisms to bypass login procedures.
    * **Abuse Insecure Default Configurations:** Exploiting weak default passwords, disabled security features, or overly permissive settings that allow unauthorized access.
    * **Exploit Logic Flaws in Authentication Handling:**  Identifying and exploiting errors or weaknesses in the code that handles user authentication, potentially allowing attackers to log in without valid credentials.
    * **Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Core:**  After gaining initial access (potentially with limited privileges), exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher-level administrative access within the ownCloud application.
    * **Abuse Inconsistent Role/Permission Enforcement:**  Circumventing or exploiting inconsistencies in how user roles and permissions are enforced, granting unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Handling Vulnerabilities in Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_handling_vulnerabilities_in_core.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Bypass File Type Restrictions:**  Uploading malicious files disguised as legitimate file types by manipulating headers or using other bypass techniques, allowing for server-side execution or other harmful actions.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in File Processing (e.g., ImageMagick, LibreOffice):**  Uploading files that trigger vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries used by ownCloud Core for file processing (e.g., for generating thumbnails or previews), potentially leading to remote code execution.
    * **Access Arbitrary Files on the Server:** Exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities by manipulating file paths in requests to access sensitive files outside of the intended directories.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities in Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities_in_core.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Missing or Weak Authentication/Authorization for API Calls:**  Accessing or manipulating API endpoints without proper authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthorized data access or modification.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by the API:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in external libraries used by ownCloud Core's API, potentially leading to various impacts like data breaches or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core's Update Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_core's_update_mechanism.md)

This critical node represents a high-risk path because successful exploitation can lead to widespread compromise by serving malicious updates to users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Handling of External Services/Integrations by Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_handling_of_external_servicesintegrations_by_core.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Weak Credentials or Vulnerabilities in External Services:** If ownCloud Core integrates with external services (like LDAP or SMTP), attackers might compromise these external services due to weak credentials or vulnerabilities, and then leverage this access to compromise the ownCloud application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities Specific to Core Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_specific_to_core_components.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Specific Core Features (e.g., File Names, Share Links):** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into user-controlled input fields within ownCloud Core features (like file names or share links) that is then executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking or data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities Specific to Core Actions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__vulnerabilities_specific_to_core_actions.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Lack of CSRF Protection on Critical Core Functionalities (e.g., Sharing, Settings Changes):**  Tricking authenticated users into unknowingly performing actions on the ownCloud application by crafting malicious links or embedding requests on attacker-controlled websites, leading to unauthorized modifications or data access.
