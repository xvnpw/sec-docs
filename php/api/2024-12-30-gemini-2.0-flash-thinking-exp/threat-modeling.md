### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving dingo/api

This list details high and critical threats that directly involve the `dingo/api` library.

*   **Threat:** Inadequate Input Sanitization within dingo/api Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious API request containing JavaScript code within a field. `dingo/api`'s input handling mechanisms fail to properly sanitize this input before it's processed or potentially returned in a response. If the application then renders this unsanitized data in a web page, the attacker's JavaScript code executes in the victim's browser.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dingo/api`'s `Request` object processing, potentially the `Validation` component if it lacks sufficient sanitization capabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `dingo/api`'s validation rules include proper sanitization or encoding of user-provided input.
        *   Developers should implement output encoding/escaping when rendering data received from the API in web pages, regardless of assumed sanitization by `dingo/api`.

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability due to dingo/api's Data Binding
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an API request with extra fields that are not intended to be modified. If `dingo/api` automatically binds request data to internal objects or database models without proper filtering or explicit whitelisting of allowed fields, the attacker can modify unintended attributes.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can potentially modify sensitive data, escalate privileges by changing user roles, or bypass security checks by manipulating internal application state.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dingo/api`'s data binding mechanisms, potentially within the `Request` handling or data transformation layers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `dingo/api` or the application's data layer to explicitly define which fields are allowed to be modified through API requests (using whitelisting).
        *   Avoid relying solely on `dingo/api`'s default data binding behavior without implementing explicit filtering.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Route Configurations in dingo/api Exposing Sensitive Functionality
    *   **Description:** `dingo/api` might have default route configurations that expose sensitive information or administrative functionalities without requiring explicit configuration or secure defaults. An attacker can discover these routes and access them without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker might gain access to administrative functions, internal API endpoints, or sensitive data that should not be publicly accessible, potentially leading to full application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dingo/api`'s `Routing` component and its default route definitions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and customize all route configurations provided by `dingo/api`, ensuring only intended and properly secured endpoints are exposed.
        *   Disable or remove any default routes that are not required or expose sensitive functionality.

*   **Threat:** API Versioning Flaws in dingo/api Allowing Access to Vulnerable Endpoints
    *   **Description:** If `dingo/api`'s API versioning mechanism is flawed or improperly implemented, an attacker might be able to access older, vulnerable versions of the API that have known security flaws, even if the application intends to use a newer, patched version.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can exploit vulnerabilities present in older API versions to bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access, or cause other security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dingo/api`'s `Versioning` component and its mechanisms for handling and enforcing API versions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `dingo/api`'s versioning is correctly configured and strictly enforced.
        *   Properly deprecate and remove older API versions to prevent access to known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerabilities within dingo/api
    *   **Description:** If `dingo/api` uses deserialization to handle data from requests (e.g., through specific content types or mechanisms) and doesn't do it securely, an attacker can craft malicious serialized payloads that, when deserialized by `dingo/api`, execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dingo/api`'s data handling and deserialization mechanisms, if applicable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using deserialization of untrusted data within `dingo/api` if possible.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, ensure `dingo/api` uses secure deserialization methods and validate the integrity and source of the data being deserialized.
