    *   Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Base Image **HIGH-RISK PATH:** **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   Coolify uses a publicly available base image with known vulnerabilities or backdoors **HIGH-RISK PATH:**

    *   Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Buildpack **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   Coolify utilizes buildpacks for application deployment
        *   An attacker compromises a buildpack used by Coolify (either a public one or a custom one) **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   The compromised buildpack injects malicious code or configurations into the deployed application
*   Exploit Managed Infrastructure Vulnerabilities via Coolify
    *   Access Managed Services with Weak Credentials Exposed by Coolify **CRITICAL NODE:**
        *   Coolify stores or exposes credentials for managed services
        *   An attacker gains access to these credentials through a Coolify vulnerability or misconfiguration and uses them to access the managed services
*   Exploit Coolify's Update Mechanism **CRITICAL NODE:**
    *   Coolify has an update mechanism (e.g., downloading updates from a remote server)
    *   The attacker compromises the update server or performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack during the update process **CRITICAL NODE:**
    *   The attacker injects malicious code into the Coolify update, compromising the platform itself

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Exploit Coolify Misconfiguration:** This path focuses on leveraging insecure configurations of the Coolify platform itself.
    *   **Weak or Default Coolify Administrator Credentials:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Coolify administrative interface using default or easily guessable credentials. If successful, this grants full control over the Coolify platform and all managed applications.
    *   **Insecure Network Configuration Exposing Coolify:**  Coolify's administrative interface or API is accessible from the public internet without proper network segmentation or firewall rules. This allows attackers to directly attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or brute-force credentials.
*   **Compromise Deployment Process via Coolify:** This path targets the application deployment process managed by Coolify.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Base Image:** Coolify uses a Docker base image for building and deploying applications. If this base image contains known vulnerabilities or backdoors, an attacker can exploit these during the deployment process to compromise the application.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Buildpack:** Coolify utilizes buildpacks to automate application deployment. If a buildpack is compromised, an attacker can inject malicious code or configurations into the deployed application during the build process.

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application via Coolify:** This is the root goal and represents the ultimate success for the attacker.
*   **Exploit Coolify Platform Vulnerability:** This node represents the exploitation of security flaws within the Coolify application itself.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Coolify Server:** Successful exploitation of an RCE vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Coolify server, granting them significant control over the platform and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
        *   **Identify an exploitable vulnerability in Coolify's codebase:** This involves finding a specific flaw in Coolify's code that can be leveraged for RCE (e.g., through insecure deserialization, command injection, or SQL injection).
        *   **Trigger the vulnerability through a network request or authenticated action:** Once a vulnerability is identified, the attacker needs to craft a specific request or action to trigger it and execute their malicious code.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass in Coolify:**  Successfully bypassing Coolify's authentication or authorization mechanisms allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to administrative functionalities or sensitive data without proper credentials.
        *   **Identify a flaw in Coolify's authentication or authorization mechanisms:** This involves finding weaknesses in how Coolify verifies user identity or manages permissions.
        *   **Exploit the flaw to gain unauthorized access to Coolify's administrative interface or API:** Once a flaw is identified, the attacker exploits it to gain access, potentially allowing them to manage applications, access secrets, or perform other privileged actions.
*   **Exploit Coolify Misconfiguration:** This node represents the exploitation of insecure settings or configurations within Coolify.
*   **Compromise Deployment Process via Coolify:** This node represents attacks targeting the application deployment pipeline managed by Coolify.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Buildpack:** This node highlights the risk of using compromised buildpacks.
        *   **An attacker compromises a buildpack used by Coolify (either a public one or a custom one):** This involves the attacker gaining control over a buildpack repository or modifying a buildpack's code to inject malicious elements.
*   **Exploit Managed Infrastructure Vulnerabilities via Coolify:**
    *   **Access Managed Services with Weak Credentials Exposed by Coolify:** If Coolify stores or exposes credentials for managed services (like databases) insecurely, an attacker gaining access to Coolify can retrieve these credentials and directly compromise the managed services.
*   **Exploit Coolify's Update Mechanism:** This node focuses on attacks targeting the software update process of Coolify itself.
    *   **The attacker compromises the update server or performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack during the update process:** This involves the attacker gaining control over the server from which Coolify downloads updates or intercepting the update process to inject malicious code into the update package.

These High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes represent the most significant threats to applications managed by Coolify and should be prioritized for security mitigation efforts.
