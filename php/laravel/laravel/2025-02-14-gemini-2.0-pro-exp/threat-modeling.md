# Threat Model Analysis for laravel/laravel

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Exploitation](./threats/mass_assignment_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to include unexpected form fields. Without proper `$fillable` or `$guarded` protection in the Eloquent model, the attacker overwrites arbitrary database columns (e.g., setting `"is_admin": true` to gain admin privileges).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, data integrity violation.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:** Eloquent ORM (model creation/update methods: `create()`, `update()`, `fill()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Define `$fillable` (whitelist) or `$guarded` (blacklist) in *every* Eloquent model. Prefer `$fillable`.
    *   Use Form Requests for validation and filtering, explicitly defining allowed fields.
    *   Avoid passing raw request data (e.g., `$request->all()`) to model methods.
    *   Consider Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).

## Threat: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** `APP_DEBUG=true` in a production environment. Attackers see detailed error messages, including stack traces, database queries, environment variables, and potentially source code.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Attackers gain sensitive information, enabling further exploits, data theft, or server control.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:** Application configuration (`.env`, `config/app.php`), error handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** set `APP_DEBUG=true` in the production `.env` file.
    *   Ensure correct production server environment variables.
    *   Implement monitoring to detect enabled debug mode.
    *   Use a robust deployment process.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) with Route Model Binding](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__with_route_model_binding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates a URL parameter used for Route Model Binding (e.g., `/users/{user}`). Without authorization checks, the attacker accesses other users' data by changing `{user}`.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:** Routing, Route Model Binding, Controllers, Middleware.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement authorization checks *within* controllers/middleware, *even with Route Model Binding*.
    *   Use Laravel's authorization (Policies, Gates).
    *   Consider UUIDs instead of sequential IDs.
    *   Use route model binding scoping.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Packages](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_packages.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses Composer packages with known vulnerabilities. Attackers exploit these to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely, from minor issues to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:** Composer dependencies, any code using the vulnerable package.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update packages (`composer update`).
    *   Use vulnerability scanners (`composer audit`, Snyk, Dependabot).
    *   Carefully vet packages before inclusion.
    *   Pin package versions (where appropriate).

## Threat: [Improper Use of `eval()` or Dynamic Code Execution](./threats/improper_use_of__eval____or_dynamic_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** A developer uses `eval()`, `assert()`, or dynamic class instantiation with unsanitized user input. An attacker provides malicious code as input, which is then executed.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:** Any code using `eval()`, `assert()`, or dynamic class instantiation based on user input. (Not a specific component, but a dangerous practice *within* Laravel).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `eval()` and similar functions at all costs.**
    *   Sanitize and validate *any* user input used in dynamic code.
    *   Use strict type hinting and validation.

## Threat: [Insecure File Uploads](./threats/insecure_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure file upload handling: allowing uploads to public directories, not validating types/content, or using predictable filenames. An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script) and executes it.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, defacement.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:** File uploads, `filesystems` configuration, controllers handling uploads, validation rules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store uploaded files *outside* the web root.
    *   Use Laravel's validation for file types and sizes.
    *   Rename files to prevent predictable names (e.g., UUIDs).
    *   Consider dedicated file storage (e.g., AWS S3) with proper security.
    *   Scan uploaded files for malware.

## Threat: [Artisan Command Injection](./threats/artisan_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing Artisan commands to user input without sanitization allows attackers to inject malicious commands/options.
*   **Impact:** Potentially RCE, data manipulation, system compromise (depending on the command).
*   **Affected Laravel Component:** Artisan console, code executing Artisan commands based on user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if present, but less likely)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** directly expose Artisan commands to user input.
    *   Use a tightly controlled whitelist of allowed commands/options.
    *   Sanitize and validate *all* user input before passing to Artisan.
    *   Consider using a queue for asynchronous command execution.
