# Threat Model Analysis for laravel/laravel

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request containing extra fields that are not intended to be modified. If an Eloquent model doesn't explicitly define allowed (`$fillable`) or disallowed (`$guarded`) attributes, Laravel might inadvertently update these attributes in the database. The attacker might manipulate sensitive data, elevate privileges, or bypass business logic.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, bypassing security checks.

**Which https://github.com/laravel/laravel component is affected:** Eloquent ORM (Model attribute assignment).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always define `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on Eloquent models to explicitly control which attributes can be mass-assigned.
*   Use Form Requests for validating and sanitizing input data before it reaches the model.
*   Review model attributes and their intended mutability regularly.

## Threat: [Unintended Code Execution via Blade Directives](./threats/unintended_code_execution_via_blade_directives.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into data that is subsequently rendered using raw Blade directives (`{!! !!}`) or through a poorly implemented custom Blade directive. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement.

**Which https://github.com/laravel/laravel component is affected:** Blade Templating Engine (Raw output directives, custom directives).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the use of raw output directives (`{!! !!}`).
*   Sanitize any data before using it with raw output directives. Use helper functions like `e()` for escaping.
*   Thoroughly review and sanitize input within custom Blade directives.
*   Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management Configuration](./threats/insecure_session_management_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit insecure session configurations to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This can happen if session cookies are not marked as `HttpOnly` or `Secure`, or if the session lifetime is too long, or if an insecure session driver is used. Attackers might steal session cookies via XSS or man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.

**Which https://github.com/laravel/laravel component is affected:** Session Management (Configuration, Middleware).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure session settings in `config/session.php` to use secure drivers (like `database` or `redis`).
*   Set `secure` and `http_only` flags to `true` for session cookies in production environments.
*   Implement appropriate session lifetime and consider using session regeneration after login.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Debug Mode or Error Pages](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_debug_mode_or_error_pages.md)

**Description:** When the application is in debug mode (`APP_DEBUG=true` in `.env`), Laravel displays detailed error messages, including file paths, code snippets, and potentially sensitive configuration details. An attacker can leverage this information to understand the application's structure, identify vulnerabilities, and potentially gain access to sensitive data.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, revealing application structure, potential for further exploitation based on exposed details.

**Which https://github.com/laravel/laravel component is affected:** Error Handling, Debugging.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (in production).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure `APP_DEBUG` is set to `false` in production environments.
*   Configure custom error pages to avoid displaying sensitive information.
*   Log errors securely and monitor them for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Unprotected Artisan Routes](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_unprotected_artisan_routes.md)

**Description:** If the Artisan route (`Route::artisan(...)`) is enabled in a production environment without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server by crafting specific requests to this route.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, service disruption.

**Which https://github.com/laravel/laravel component is affected:** Artisan Console, Routing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the Artisan route is disabled or heavily protected in production environments.
*   If needed for specific purposes, implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the Artisan route.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Key Generation or Storage](./threats/insecure_default_key_generation_or_storage.md)

**Description:** If the application key (`APP_KEY` in `.env`) is not securely generated or if it's accidentally exposed, an attacker can decrypt encrypted data (e.g., cookies, encrypted database fields) and potentially forge signed data.

**Impact:** Data breach, session hijacking, bypassing security measures relying on encryption or signing.

**Which https://github.com/laravel/laravel component is affected:** Encryption Service, Configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Generate a strong, random application key during installation using `php artisan key:generate`.
*   Securely store the `.env` file and prevent unauthorized access.
*   Rotate the application key if there's a suspicion of compromise.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Queued Jobs](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_queued_jobs.md)

**Description:** If queued jobs process serialized data from untrusted sources, attackers might be able to inject malicious serialized objects that, when unserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution.

**Which https://github.com/laravel/laravel component is affected:** Queues, Serialization.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid passing user-controlled, serialized data directly to queued jobs.
*   Sanitize and validate data before serializing it for queue processing.
*   Consider using signed or encrypted payloads for queued jobs.
