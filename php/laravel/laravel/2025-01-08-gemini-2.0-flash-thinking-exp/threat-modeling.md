# Threat Model Analysis for laravel/laravel

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate HTTP request parameters to include fields not intended for modification. If the Eloquent model isn't properly protected with `$fillable` or `$guarded`, these extra fields could be used to update sensitive database columns, potentially altering user roles, permissions, or other critical data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, data corruption.

**Affected Component:** Eloquent ORM (Model attributes).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Define `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on Eloquent models to explicitly control which attributes can be mass-assigned.
*   Use Form Requests for input validation and sanitization before passing data to the model.

## Threat: [Insecure Use of Raw Blade Output](./threats/insecure_use_of_raw_blade_output.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts or HTML code into data that is then rendered using the `!! ... !!` syntax in Blade templates. This bypasses Blade's automatic escaping and allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Affected Component:** Blade Templating Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using `!! ... !!` for outputting data unless you are absolutely certain the data is safe and does not originate from user input or untrusted sources.
*   Prefer the default `{{ ... }}` syntax, which automatically escapes output.

## Threat: [Command Injection via User Input in Artisan Commands](./threats/command_injection_via_user_input_in_artisan_commands.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom Artisan commands that accept user input. If this input is not properly sanitized before being used in shell commands (e.g., using `exec()`, `shell_exec()`), the attacker could inject malicious commands to be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.

**Affected Component:** Artisan Console, Custom Commands.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using user-provided input directly in shell commands within Artisan commands.
*   If necessary, use PHP's built-in functions for escaping shell arguments (`escapeshellarg()`, `escapeshellcmd()`).
*   Consider alternative approaches that don't involve executing shell commands.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Queued Jobs](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_queued_jobs.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when processed by a queued job, could lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a risk if queued jobs handle data from untrusted sources without proper validation.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.

**Affected Component:** Laravel Queues, Job processing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid processing serialized data from untrusted sources in queued jobs.
*   Sign serialized data using encryption keys to prevent tampering.
*   Use alternative data formats like JSON if possible.
