## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Eloquent ORM Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_eloquent_orm_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Insecure Usage of Raw Queries **[CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Step:** SQL Injection through dynamically constructed raw queries.
    *   **Description:** When developers use raw SQL queries (instead of Eloquent's query builder) and directly embed user-supplied data without proper sanitization or parameter binding, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Potential Consequences:**  Full database compromise, including reading, modifying, or deleting sensitive data. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and complete loss of data integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Blade Templating Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_blade_templating_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) **[CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Step:** Injecting malicious Blade directives or PHP code into templates.
    *   **Description:** If user-controlled input is directly embedded into Blade templates without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious Blade directives or even raw PHP code. The Blade engine will then execute this code on the server.
    *   **Potential Consequences:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, or completely take over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities **[HIGH RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Weak or Default Authentication Configurations **[CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Step:** Using default encryption keys or salts. **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** If the Laravel application uses default encryption keys or salts (the `APP_KEY` in the `.env` file), an attacker who knows these defaults can decrypt sensitive data, including session information and potentially encrypted credentials. This significantly weakens the entire authentication system.
    *   **Potential Consequences:**  Compromise of user credentials, session hijacking, ability to impersonate users, and potentially gain administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities **[HIGH RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Details **[CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Step:** Accessing the `.env` file through misconfiguration or directory traversal.
    *   **Description:**  If the `.env` file is accessible via the web server due to incorrect server configuration or directory traversal vulnerabilities, attackers can directly read its contents.
    *   **Potential Consequences:**  Exposure of critical secrets, including database credentials, API keys for third-party services, and other sensitive environment variables. This information can be used for further attacks, such as database breaches, unauthorized access to external services, and complete application takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Artisan Console Vulnerabilities (If Applicable - Requires Access)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_artisan_console_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_-_requires_access_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Command Injection through Artisan **[CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Step:** Executing arbitrary commands on the server by exploiting custom Artisan commands with insufficient input validation.
    *   **Description:** If custom Artisan commands accept user input without proper validation and this input is used to execute system commands, attackers who gain access to execute Artisan commands can inject malicious commands.
    *   **Potential Consequences:**  Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, or completely take over the server. This typically requires some level of initial access to the server or a way to trigger the Artisan command.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Queues and Jobs Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_queues_and_jobs_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Deserialization Attacks on Queued Jobs **[CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Step:** Injecting malicious serialized data into the queue that gets executed when the job is processed.
    *   **Description:** If the application uses serialized objects in queued jobs and doesn't properly validate the data being deserialized, an attacker can inject malicious serialized data. When the queue worker processes this job, the malicious object will be deserialized, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Potential Consequences:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, or completely take over the server. This depends on the presence of vulnerable classes in the application or its dependencies.
