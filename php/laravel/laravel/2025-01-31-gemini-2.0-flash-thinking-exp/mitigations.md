# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for laravel/laravel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities - Utilize `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties](./mitigation_strategies/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_-_utilize__$fillable__or__$guarded__properties.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties in Eloquent models.

**Description:**
*   **Step 1: Model Review:** Examine your Laravel application's Eloquent models located in `app/Models`.
*   **Step 2: Define `$fillable` or `$guarded`:** For each model, within the model class definition, choose to implement either the `$fillable` or `$guarded` protected property.
    *   **`$fillable` (Recommended):**  Define a protected array named `$fillable` containing a list of attribute names that are permitted to be mass-assigned. This acts as a whitelist. Example: `protected $fillable = ['title', 'content', 'author_id'];`
    *   **`$guarded`:** Define a protected array named `$guarded` containing a list of attribute names that should *not* be mass-assigned. This acts as a blacklist.  Example: `protected $guarded = ['id', 'is_admin'];` or `protected $guarded = ['*'];` to block all mass assignment by default.
*   **Step 3: Code Consistency:** Ensure all Eloquent models in your Laravel project consistently use either `$fillable` or `$guarded` to control mass assignment.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Mass Assignment - Severity: High (Attackers can modify unintended database columns by manipulating request parameters, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data breaches).

**Impact:**
*   Mass Assignment: High Risk Reduction (Directly prevents attackers from exploiting mass assignment vulnerabilities by enforcing explicit attribute control within Laravel models).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Implementation status varies across projects. Some models might utilize `$fillable` or `$guarded`, while others might be missing these protections.
*   Default Laravel scaffolding might include basic examples, but custom models often require manual implementation.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Systematic review of all Eloquent models in `app/Models` to ensure consistent and appropriate use of `$fillable` or `$guarded`.
*   Establish project coding standards mandating the use of `$fillable` (preferred) or `$guarded` for all Eloquent models.
*   Integrate code analysis tools to automatically detect models lacking mass assignment protection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities - Prioritize Eloquent ORM and Query Builder](./mitigation_strategies/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_-_prioritize_eloquent_orm_and_query_builder.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Prioritize Eloquent ORM and Query Builder.

**Description:**
*   **Step 1: Codebase Audit:** Search your Laravel codebase for instances of direct database interactions that bypass Laravel's ORM and Query Builder, specifically looking for `DB::raw()`, `DB::statement()`, and manual database connection methods.
*   **Step 2: Refactor to Laravel ORM/Query Builder:**  For each identified instance of raw SQL, refactor the code to utilize Laravel's Eloquent ORM or Query Builder. These tools automatically use parameterized queries, mitigating SQL injection risks.
*   **Step 3: Parameterized Raw Queries (If Necessary):** If raw SQL is unavoidable for complex queries or performance reasons, ensure you use Laravel's parameter binding features. Use placeholders (`?`) and pass parameters as an array to methods like `DB::select()`, `DB::update()`, `DB::delete()`, etc. Example: `DB::select('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?', [$username]);`
*   **Step 4: Developer Training:** Educate developers on the importance of using Laravel's ORM and Query Builder for secure database interactions and the risks associated with raw SQL.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   SQL Injection - Severity: High (Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or compromising the database server).

**Impact:**
*   SQL Injection: High Risk Reduction (Leveraging Laravel's built-in database tools significantly reduces the attack surface for SQL injection vulnerabilities by promoting secure query construction).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Laravel framework encourages and defaults to using Eloquent and Query Builder, so many parts of the application likely benefit from this protection.
*   Newer Laravel projects are more likely to adhere to these best practices.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive code review of older or less maintained sections of the application to identify and refactor any legacy raw SQL queries.
*   Establish coding guidelines that strongly discourage or strictly control the use of `DB::raw()` and raw SQL.
*   Implement static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, including misuse of `DB::raw()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities - Leverage Blade Templating Engine's automatic escaping](./mitigation_strategies/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_-_leverage_blade_templating_engine's_automatic_escaping.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage Blade Templating Engine's automatic escaping.

**Description:**
*   **Step 1: Template Review:** Examine your Laravel Blade templates (`.blade.php` files) for outputting dynamic data.
*   **Step 2: Verify `{{ }}` Usage:** Ensure that you are primarily using the standard Blade output syntax `{{ $variable }}` for displaying dynamic content. This syntax automatically escapes HTML entities, preventing basic XSS attacks.
*   **Step 3: Scrutinize `!! !!` Usage:** Search for instances of `!! $variable !!` (unescaped output) in your Blade templates. This syntax bypasses automatic escaping.
*   **Step 4: Justify and Sanitize Unescaped Output (If Necessary):** If `!! !!` is used, rigorously justify its necessity. If unescaped output is required, ensure the data is *already* safely sanitized *before* being passed to the Blade template.  If the data originates from user input, server-side sanitization is mandatory.
*   **Step 5: Content Security Policy (CSP) via Laravel Middleware:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header using Laravel middleware to further restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, adding another layer of XSS defense.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High (Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to account hijacking, session theft, or website defacement).

**Impact:**
*   XSS: High Risk Reduction (Laravel's Blade templating engine's automatic escaping significantly reduces the risk of common XSS vulnerabilities by default).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Blade's automatic escaping is a core feature of Laravel and is likely used throughout most of the application's views.
*   New Laravel projects inherently benefit from this default protection.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Audit Blade templates to identify and minimize the use of `!! !!` unescaped output.
*   Implement server-side HTML sanitization for any user-provided HTML content that needs to be displayed unescaped.
*   Configure and enable a Content Security Policy (CSP) header in Laravel middleware to enhance XSS protection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities - Ensure CSRF protection middleware and `@csrf` directive are used](./mitigation_strategies/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__vulnerabilities_-_ensure_csrf_protection_middleware_and__@csrf__di_e2f628ba.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure CSRF protection middleware and `@csrf` directive are used.

**Description:**
*   **Step 1: Middleware Verification:** Check `app/Http/Kernel.php` and confirm that `\App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class` is included in the `$middlewareGroups['web']` array. This middleware is essential for Laravel's CSRF protection for web routes.
*   **Step 2: Form Directive Audit:** Review all HTML forms within your Laravel Blade templates. For every `<form>` tag that submits data (using POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE methods), ensure the `@csrf` Blade directive is placed inside the form. This directive generates a hidden CSRF token field.
*   **Step 3: AJAX CSRF Token Handling (Laravel Sanctum/Headers):** If your Laravel application uses AJAX requests to modify data, ensure CSRF tokens are correctly handled. Laravel Sanctum (for API authentication) often handles this automatically. For other AJAX scenarios, ensure the CSRF token is included in request headers (e.g., `X-CSRF-TOKEN`) or as a request parameter. Laravel's middleware will automatically verify the token.
*   **Step 4: Review CSRF Exclusions:** Examine the `$except` property in `\App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class`. If any routes are excluded from CSRF protection, carefully evaluate the security implications and minimize these exceptions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - Severity: Medium (Attackers can trick authenticated users into unknowingly performing actions on the application, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or modifying data).

**Impact:**
*   CSRF: High Risk Reduction (Laravel's built-in CSRF protection, when correctly implemented with middleware and `@csrf` directives, effectively prevents CSRF attacks).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Laravel includes CSRF protection middleware by default, and the `@csrf` directive is standard practice in Laravel form development.
*   New Laravel projects typically have CSRF protection enabled out-of-the-box.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Systematic audit of all Blade templates to confirm the presence of `@csrf` in all relevant forms.
*   Verify that AJAX requests, especially those modifying data, are correctly handling CSRF tokens (if not using Laravel Sanctum).
*   Minimize and thoroughly justify any routes excluded from CSRF protection in the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Session Security - Configure secure session settings in `config/session.php`](./mitigation_strategies/session_security_-_configure_secure_session_settings_in__configsession_php_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure secure session settings in `config/session.php`.

**Description:**
*   **Step 1: `session.php` Configuration Review:** Open `config/session.php` in your Laravel application and review the following key settings:
    *   `'secure' => env('SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE', true),` : Ensure this is set to `true` in production (or controlled by `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true` in `.env`). This forces session cookies to be transmitted only over HTTPS.
    *   `'http_only' => true,` : Verify this is set to `true`. This prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing session cookies, mitigating XSS-based session hijacking.
    *   `'same_site' => 'lax' or 'strict',` : Consider setting `'same_site'` to `'lax'` or `'strict'` to enhance CSRF protection by controlling when session cookies are sent in cross-site requests. `'strict'` offers stronger protection but might impact legitimate cross-site navigation.
    *   `'lifetime' => 120,` (example): Review and adjust the `'lifetime'` setting to an appropriate session timeout duration in minutes. Shorter lifetimes generally improve security.
    *   `'driver' => env('SESSION_DRIVER', 'file'),` : For production environments, consider using a more robust session driver like `'database'` or `'redis'` instead of the default `'file'` driver for improved performance, scalability, and potentially security.
*   **Step 2: Session Regeneration (Laravel Auth):** Laravel's built-in authentication system typically handles session regeneration after successful login using `session()->regenerate()`. Verify this is in place in your authentication logic to prevent session fixation attacks.
*   **Step 3: Idle Timeout (Custom Implementation if Needed):** While Laravel's `'lifetime'` handles session expiration, implement custom idle timeout logic if required by your security policy. This might involve middleware to track user activity and invalidate sessions after a period of inactivity, even if the `'lifetime'` hasn't expired.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Session Hijacking - Severity: High (Attackers can steal session cookies and impersonate users, gaining unauthorized access to accounts and data).
*   Session Fixation - Severity: Medium (Attackers can pre-set a user's session ID, potentially leading to account takeover).
*   CSRF (partially mitigated by `same_site`) - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Session Hijacking: High Risk Reduction (Secure and `http_only` cookies significantly reduce session hijacking risks).
*   Session Fixation: High Risk Reduction (Session regeneration after login effectively prevents session fixation).
*   CSRF: Medium Risk Reduction (`same_site` provides an additional layer of defense against CSRF).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Laravel's default `config/session.php` often includes secure defaults or easy environment variable configuration for `'secure'` and `'http_only'`.
