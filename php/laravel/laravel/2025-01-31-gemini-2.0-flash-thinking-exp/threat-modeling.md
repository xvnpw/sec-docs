# Threat Model Analysis for laravel/laravel

## Threat: [Exposure of `.env` file](./threats/exposure_of___env__file.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Attacker might gain unauthorized access to the `.env` file by exploiting misconfigurations in the web server or accessing it through publicly accessible paths.
    *   Once accessed, the attacker can read sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, application secrets, and other environment variables.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Full compromise of the application and associated infrastructure.
    *   Data breaches, unauthorized access to databases, external services, and potential account takeovers.
    *   Loss of confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:**
    *   Configuration system, specifically `.env` file handling and environment variable loading.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure web server configuration (Nginx, Apache, etc.) prevents direct access to `.env` files.
    *   Properly configure `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` from version control systems.
    *   Use environment variables directly in production environments instead of solely relying on `.env` where possible.
    *   Implement strict file permissions on the server to restrict access to the `.env` file to only the necessary users and processes.

## Threat: [Debug mode enabled in production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Developer accidentally or unknowingly leaves debug mode enabled in production (`APP_DEBUG=true` in `.env`).
    *   Attacker can trigger application errors or access debug pages to view detailed error messages, stack traces, database queries, and potentially sensitive application code and configuration details.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Information disclosure leading to further attacks.
    *   Exposure of application internals, database structure, code paths, and potentially sensitive data in error messages.
    *   Facilitates identification of vulnerabilities and exploitation points.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:**
    *   Error handling and debugging features, specifically the `APP_DEBUG` configuration and error reporting mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly disable debug mode in production environments.** Ensure `APP_DEBUG=false` in production `.env` or environment variables.
    *   Implement robust logging and error monitoring solutions that log errors securely without exposing sensitive information to end-users.
    *   Regularly review error logs for unexpected errors that might indicate security issues.

## Threat: [Use of default application key](./threats/use_of_default_application_key.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Developer fails to change the default application key generated by Laravel during installation.
    *   Attacker, knowing the default key or through brute-force if it's weak, can decrypt encrypted data, forge session cookies, bypass CSRF protection, or perform other cryptographic attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Potential for complete application compromise.
    *   Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, data decryption, CSRF bypass, and other severe security breaches.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:**
    *   Encryption services, session management, CSRF protection, and other components relying on the application key.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately change the default application key** to a strong, randomly generated key using `php artisan key:generate`.
    *   Store the application key securely and consider rotating it periodically as a security best practice.
    *   Ensure the application key is securely managed and not exposed in version control or public repositories.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in Eloquent Models](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_eloquent_models.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Developer does not properly define `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties in Eloquent models.
    *   Attacker can manipulate unexpected model attributes by sending malicious input data in requests, potentially modifying sensitive data, escalating privileges, or bypassing access controls.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High to Critical:** Depending on the affected model and attributes.
    *   Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, bypassing business logic, and potential data breaches.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:**
    *   Eloquent ORM, specifically model attribute handling and mass assignment functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity of affected models)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always define `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties** in Eloquent models to explicitly control which attributes can be mass-assigned.
    *   Use request validation to sanitize and validate input data before mass assignment.
    *   Consider using explicit attribute assignment instead of mass assignment for sensitive operations, especially when dealing with user input.

## Threat: [Blade Template Injection](./threats/blade_template_injection.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Developer uses unescaped output (`{!! !!}`) in Blade templates with user-controlled data or dynamically constructs Blade directives based on user input without proper sanitization.
    *   Attacker can inject malicious scripts into Blade templates, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks when the template is rendered in a user's browser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Account hijacking, session theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:**
    *   Blade templating engine, specifically unescaped output and dynamic directive compilation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primarily use escaped output (`{{ }}`)** in Blade templates. Laravel automatically escapes output by default, mitigating XSS.
    *   **Avoid using unescaped output (`{!! !!}`)** unless absolutely necessary and you are certain the data is safe and trusted.
    *   If using unescaped output, carefully sanitize and validate the data before rendering it in Blade templates, using appropriate escaping functions.
    *   Never dynamically construct Blade directives based on user input.

## Threat: [Insecure use of Artisan Console commands](./threats/insecure_use_of_artisan_console_commands.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Developer exposes Artisan commands through web interfaces or APIs (discouraged but possible) or directly incorporates unsanitized user input into Artisan commands.
    *   Attacker can inject malicious commands into Artisan commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities and potential remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   Full server compromise, data breaches, service disruption, and other severe security incidents.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:**
    *   Artisan console, specifically command execution and handling of user input within commands.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid exposing Artisan commands directly to untrusted users or external interfaces.**
    *   If user input is necessary for Artisan commands, **thoroughly sanitize and validate** the input to prevent command injection.
    *   Use parameterized commands or command arguments instead of directly concatenating user input into command strings.
    *   Implement strict access control and authentication for any interfaces that interact with Artisan commands.

## Threat: [Session fixation and hijacking due to insecure session configuration](./threats/session_fixation_and_hijacking_due_to_insecure_session_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Laravel application is not configured to use secure session settings, such as not using HTTPS, not setting secure and HTTP-only flags on session cookies, or using weak session drivers.
    *   Attacker can perform session fixation or hijacking attacks to impersonate legitimate users by stealing or manipulating session IDs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.
    *   Account takeover, data breaches, and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users.
*   **Affected Laravel Component:**
    *   Session management, specifically session configuration and cookie handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use HTTPS** for Laravel applications to encrypt session data in transit.
    *   **Configure session cookies with `secure` and `httpOnly` flags** in `config/session.php`.
    *   Use a strong session driver (e.g., `database`, `redis`, `memcached`) instead of the default `file` driver in production for better performance and security.
    *   Implement session regeneration after authentication and other sensitive actions to prevent session fixation.
    *   Consider using shorter session lifetimes and implementing idle session timeouts.
