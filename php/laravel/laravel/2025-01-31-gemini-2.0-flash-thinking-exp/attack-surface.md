# Attack Surface Analysis for laravel/laravel

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify unintended database columns by manipulating request input data if model attributes are not properly protected. This is due to the default behavior of Laravel's Eloquent ORM.
*   **Laravel Contribution:** Eloquent ORM's default behavior allows mass assignment. If `$fillable` or `$guarded` model properties are not defined in Eloquent models, all model attributes become mass assignable by default. This design choice directly contributes to the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A user sends a POST request to update their profile, including an unexpected `is_admin` field. If the `User` model doesn't protect `is_admin` using `$fillable` or `$guarded`, the attacker can elevate their privileges to administrator.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized data modification.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use `$fillable` or `$guarded`:** Explicitly define which attributes are mass assignable in each Eloquent model using `$fillable` (allowed attributes) or `$guarded` (forbidden attributes). This is the primary Laravel-specific mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs before using them to update models, ensuring only expected data is processed. While general, it complements Laravel's mass assignment protection.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Blade](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_blade.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Blade templates, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This is enabled by Blade's raw output directive.
*   **Laravel Contribution:** Blade templating engine provides the `{!! !!}` directive for raw output. While intended for specific use cases, its misuse or improper handling of user input directly in templates creates a significant SSTI attack surface.
*   **Example:** A developer uses `{!! request('name') !!}` in a Blade template to display a user's name. An attacker can input Blade code like `{{ system('whoami') }}` as their name, executing the `whoami` command on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full server compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Escape User Input:** Use `{{ }}` for displaying user-provided data in Blade templates. This directive automatically escapes output, preventing code injection and is the recommended Laravel practice.
    *   **Avoid `{!! !!}` with User Input:**  Never use `{!! !!}` to display user-generated content unless absolutely necessary and after extremely careful sanitization and validation. This is a Laravel-specific guideline for secure Blade usage.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate user input before passing it to Blade templates, even when using escaping, as a general security best practice.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Raw Queries or Misused Query Builder](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_raw_queries_or_misused_query_builder.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, allowing them to bypass security controls, access unauthorized data, or modify data. While Laravel's ORM is secure by default, developers can bypass these protections.
*   **Laravel Contribution:** Laravel's Eloquent ORM and Query Builder are designed to prevent SQL injection through parameter binding. However, Laravel also provides features like `DB::raw()` and `\DB::statement()` which, if misused with unsanitized user input, can directly lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This flexibility, while powerful, increases the attack surface if not handled carefully.
*   **Example:** A developer uses `DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . request('username') . "'")`. An attacker can input `' OR '1'='1` as the username, bypassing the username check and retrieving all user data. This bypasses Laravel's intended secure query building.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, authentication bypass, Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Parameter Binding:** Always use parameter binding (placeholders and separate data parameters) when constructing database queries, especially with user input. Laravel's Query Builder and Eloquent automatically use parameter binding and should be preferred.
    *   **Avoid Raw Queries with User Input:** Minimize the use of raw queries (`DB::raw()`, `\DB::statement()`) when dealing with user-provided data. If necessary, sanitize and validate input rigorously before using it in raw queries. This is a Laravel-specific recommendation to leverage the framework's security features.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious SQL syntax, as a general security practice.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper validation on file uploads allows attackers to upload malicious files, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, or DoS. Laravel provides file handling tools, but security is developer's responsibility.
*   **Laravel Contribution:** Laravel provides file upload handling features through request objects and storage facades, making file uploads easy to implement. However, the framework itself doesn't enforce security measures on file uploads, leaving it entirely to the developer to implement validation and security checks. This ease of use without built-in security guidance can contribute to vulnerabilities if developers are not security-conscious.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to upload profile pictures without file type validation. An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the web server executes PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary code by accessing the uploaded script.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), website defacement, malware distribution, Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File Type Validation (Whitelist):** Validate file types based on a whitelist of allowed extensions and MIME types. Laravel's validation rules can be used for this purpose.
    *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce limits on file sizes to prevent DoS attacks and resource exhaustion. Laravel's validation rules can also enforce size limits.
    *   **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct execution. Laravel's storage configuration allows defining custom disk locations. Configure web server to prevent execution of scripts in upload directories (e.g., using `.htaccess` or server configuration).
    *   **Rename Uploaded Files:** Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable filenames and potential path traversal vulnerabilities. Laravel's `Storage` facade provides methods for file manipulation and renaming.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Packages](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_packages.md)

*   **Description:** Laravel applications heavily rely on third-party packages managed by Composer. Vulnerabilities in these packages can directly impact application security. Laravel's ecosystem encourages package usage.
*   **Laravel Contribution:** Laravel's architecture and the Composer package manager are central to its development workflow, strongly encouraging the use of third-party packages to extend functionality. While beneficial for development speed, this reliance inherently increases the attack surface by introducing dependencies that are outside of the core Laravel framework's direct control.
*   **Example:** A popular Laravel package used for image processing has a known vulnerability. If the application uses this vulnerable package, it becomes susceptible to the same vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, can range from information disclosure to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep all third-party packages updated to the latest versions, including security patches. Use `composer update` regularly.
    *   **Security Audits of Dependencies:** Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `composer audit` or online vulnerability databases.
    *   **Choose Reputable Packages:** Select well-maintained and reputable packages from trusted sources.
    *   **Dependency Scanning in CI/CD:** Integrate dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and alert on vulnerable dependencies before deployment.
