# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Laravel framework project aims to provide a robust, elegant, and developer-friendly PHP web framework. It prioritizes developer experience, rapid application development, and maintainability of web applications. The primary goal is to empower developers to build high-quality web applications efficiently.

Key business priorities and goals include:
- Enhancing developer productivity and satisfaction.
- Providing a comprehensive set of features for modern web development.
- Maintaining a vibrant and active open-source community.
- Ensuring the framework is performant and scalable.
- Supporting a wide range of application types, from small projects to large enterprise systems.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities within the framework itself could impact a vast number of applications built using Laravel.
- Dependency on community contributions for security updates and maintenance introduces a risk of delayed or inadequate responses to security issues.
- Complexity of the framework and its ecosystem could lead to misconfigurations and security weaknesses in applications built on top of it.
- Potential for supply chain attacks targeting dependencies used by Laravel or its ecosystem.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Laravel incorporates built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Implemented within the framework's core and documented in Laravel documentation.
- security control: Laravel utilizes parameterized queries and Eloquent ORM to mitigate SQL Injection vulnerabilities. Implemented within the database interaction layer of the framework.
- security control: Laravel provides mechanisms for input validation and sanitization. Documented in Laravel documentation and implemented by developers using framework's validation features.
- security control: Laravel offers tools for secure authentication and authorization, including built-in authentication scaffolding and policies. Documented in Laravel documentation and implemented by developers using framework's authentication and authorization features.
- security control: Laravel encourages the use of HTTPS for secure communication. Best practice recommended in Laravel documentation.
- security control: Regular security audits and community contributions help identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Part of the open-source development process and community engagement.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, there is an inherent risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the framework.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community for vulnerability reporting and patching introduces a potential delay in security updates.
- accepted risk: Security of applications built with Laravel heavily depends on developers following security best practices and correctly utilizing framework's security features.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dependency Scanning in the Laravel development and release pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
- security control: Establish a formal Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy and a dedicated security team or point of contact to manage security reports and releases.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security code reviews by external security experts to identify and remediate potential weaknesses.
- security control: Enhance security documentation and provide more comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for developers using Laravel.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: The framework itself does not handle direct user authentication, but it provides robust tools and features for developers to implement secure authentication in applications built with Laravel. The framework must ensure that its authentication components are secure and easy to use correctly.
- Authorization: Laravel provides authorization mechanisms (Policies, Gates) to control access to resources within applications. The framework must ensure these mechanisms are robust and prevent unauthorized access when correctly implemented by developers.
- Input Validation: Laravel's input validation features are crucial for preventing various attacks. The framework must provide comprehensive and easy-to-use validation rules and mechanisms that are secure by default.
- Cryptography: Laravel utilizes cryptography for various features like password hashing, encryption, and secure session management. The framework must use strong cryptographic algorithms and best practices to protect sensitive data.
