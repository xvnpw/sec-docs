## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Laravel Application (Attacker's Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_laravel_application__attacker's_goal_.md)

*   **Compromise Laravel Application (Attacker's Goal)**
    *   Description: The ultimate objective of the attacker. Success signifies a breach of the application's security.
    *   Insight: This is the root goal that all other attacks aim to achieve.
    *   Action: Implement comprehensive security measures across all aspects of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_tree_paths/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Route Parameter Injection**
    *   Description: Attackers manipulate route parameters to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.
    *   Insight: Occurs when route parameters are not properly sanitized or validated before being used in application logic or database queries.
    *   Action:
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid directly using route parameters in sensitive operations without validation.
    *   Risk Metrics:
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Mass Assignment Vulnerability**
    *   Description: Attackers inject unexpected data into model attributes during creation or updates, potentially modifying unintended database columns.
    *   Insight: Happens when Eloquent models are not properly guarded against mass assignment, allowing attackers to set arbitrary model attributes through user input.
    *   Action:
        *   Use the `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on Eloquent models to explicitly control which attributes can be mass assigned.
        *   Avoid using `Model::unguard()` in production code.
        *   Carefully review and limit the attributes that can be filled from user input.
    *   Risk Metrics:
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**
    *   Description: Attackers inject malicious code into Blade templates that gets executed on the server.
    *   Insight: Occurs when user-controlled input is directly embedded into Blade directives without proper escaping or sanitization.
    *   Action:
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly within Blade directives.
        *   Sanitize and escape data properly before rendering it in Blade templates.
        *   Utilize Blade's built-in escaping mechanisms.
    *   Risk Metrics:
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Raw Query Vulnerabilities (If Used)](./attack_tree_paths/raw_query_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

*   **Raw Query Vulnerabilities (If Used)**
    *   Description: Attackers inject malicious SQL into raw database queries, leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    *   Insight: Arises when developers use `DB::raw()` or similar methods to execute SQL queries constructed with unsanitized user input.
    *   Action:
        *   Avoid using raw queries whenever possible.
        *   If raw queries are necessary, use parameter binding (`?` placeholders and passing parameters) to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input used in raw queries.
    *   Risk Metrics:
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Custom Authentication Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_custom_authentication_logic.md)

*   **Exploiting Custom Authentication Logic**
    *   Description: Attackers identify and exploit flaws in custom authentication implementations to bypass login mechanisms.
    *   Insight: Vulnerabilities can arise from insecure password hashing, flawed session management, or incorrect implementation of authentication checks.
    *   Action:
        *   Thoroughly review and test custom authentication implementations.
        *   Utilize Laravel's built-in authentication features whenever possible.
        *   Follow security best practices for password hashing, session management, and authorization.
    *   Risk Metrics:
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Configuration Variables](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_configuration_variables.md)

*   **Expose Sensitive Configuration Variables**
    *   Description: Attackers gain access to environment variables or configuration files containing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc.
    *   Insight: Occurs due to misconfigured web servers, insecure file permissions, or accidentally committing sensitive information to version control.
    *   Action:
        *   Secure configuration files and environment variables with appropriate permissions.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in code.
        *   Use environment variables and tools like `php artisan config:cache`.
        *   Ensure proper `.gitignore` configuration to prevent committing sensitive files.
    *   Risk Metrics:
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerable Dependencies**
    *   Description: Attackers compromise the application by exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party packages managed by Composer.
    *   Insight: Arises when dependencies are outdated or have known security flaws that attackers can leverage.
    *   Action:
        *   Regularly update dependencies using `composer update`.
        *   Use tools like `composer audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for your dependencies.
    *   Risk Metrics:
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low to Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks.md)

*   **Supply Chain Attacks**
    *   Description: Attackers introduce malicious code through compromised dependencies, potentially without the direct knowledge of the application developers.
    *   Insight: This is a more sophisticated attack where the attacker targets the dependency itself, injecting malicious code that gets included in applications using that dependency.
    *   Action:
        *   Carefully review dependencies and their maintainers.
        *   Use tools to verify package integrity (e.g., checksum verification).
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools that analyze code for suspicious patterns.
        *   Be cautious about adding dependencies from untrusted sources.
    *   Risk Metrics:
        *   Likelihood: Very Low
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: High
        *   Detection Difficulty: High
