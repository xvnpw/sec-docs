# Threat Model Analysis for laravel/framework

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

- Description: An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests with unexpected parameters that are not explicitly allowed by the Eloquent model's `$fillable` property or are explicitly excluded by `$guarded`. This allows them to modify database columns they shouldn't have access to, potentially changing sensitive data or escalating privileges.
- Impact: Data corruption, unauthorized modification of critical data, privilege escalation if admin flags or similar fields are modified.
- Affected Component: Eloquent Model's `fillable` and `guarded` properties, request handling.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Always define the `$fillable` property on your Eloquent models to explicitly specify which attributes can be mass-assigned.
  - Alternatively, use the `$guarded` property to specify attributes that should *not* be mass-assigned.
  - Avoid using `$guarded = []` unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason, as this disables mass assignment protection.
  - Carefully review and understand the data being passed in requests.

## Threat: [Unescaped Blade Output Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/unescaped_blade_output_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

- Description: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data that is then rendered in a Blade template using the `{{ !! $variable !! }}` syntax without proper sanitization. When other users view the page, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on their behalf.
- Impact: Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application.
- Affected Component: Blade templating engine, specifically the unescaped output syntax `{{ !! }}`.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Always use the default escaped output syntax `{{ $variable }}` unless you have a very specific reason to output raw HTML and you are absolutely certain the data is safe.
  - If you need to output raw HTML, sanitize the data thoroughly using a library like HTMLPurifier before passing it to the view.
  - Be extremely cautious when outputting user-generated content or data from external sources.

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection Leading to SQL Injection (with Raw Queries or `DB::raw()`)](./threats/route_parameter_injection_leading_to_sql_injection__with_raw_queries_or__dbraw____.md)

- Description: An attacker manipulates route parameters to inject malicious SQL code when these parameters are directly used in database queries without proper sanitization or using raw queries or `DB::raw()` without careful escaping. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
- Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, potential for complete database compromise.
- Affected Component: Routing component, database interaction (specifically raw queries or `DB::raw()`).
- Risk Severity: Critical
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Avoid using raw SQL queries or `DB::raw()` whenever possible. Utilize Eloquent's query builder, which provides protection against common SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  - If you must use raw queries, always use parameter binding (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection. Never directly concatenate user input into SQL queries.
  - Validate and sanitize all route parameters before using them in database queries.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Queued Jobs](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_queued_jobs.md)

- Description: An attacker crafts malicious serialized data that, when processed by a queued job, can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This can occur if the application processes unserialized data from untrusted sources without proper validation.
- Impact: Remote code execution, full server compromise.
- Affected Component: Queue component, specifically the processing of serialized job payloads.
- Risk Severity: Critical
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Avoid passing complex, unserialized objects in queue jobs if possible. Prefer passing simple data types.
  - If you must pass serialized data, ensure that the data originates from a trusted source and is validated before being unserialized.
  - Be cautious when using PHP's `unserialize()` function with data from unknown sources. Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Configuration](./threats/insecure_session_configuration.md)

- Description: An attacker can exploit misconfigured session settings to hijack user sessions. This includes using insecure session drivers (like `file` in production without proper permissions), not using HTTPS for session cookies, or having a weak `APP_KEY`.
- Impact: Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
- Affected Component: Session management component, configuration files (`config/session.php`).
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Use secure session drivers like `database`, `redis`, or `memcached` in production environments.
  - Ensure that your application is served over HTTPS to protect session cookies from being intercepted. Set the `secure` flag to `true` in your `config/session.php` file.
  - Set the `http_only` flag to `true` to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing session cookies.
  - Generate a strong and unique `APP_KEY` and keep it secret. Rotate the `APP_KEY` periodically.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Artisan Commands](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_artisan_commands.md)

- Description: An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the server or the application's codebase might be able to execute custom Artisan commands that inadvertently reveal sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or internal system details.
- Impact: Information disclosure, potential for further attacks using the exposed information.
- Affected Component: Artisan console component, custom Artisan commands.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Carefully review the output and logging of custom Artisan commands to ensure they do not reveal sensitive information.
  - Restrict access to the server and the application's codebase.
  - Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in Artisan commands. Use environment variables or secure configuration management.

## Threat: [Insecure Dependency Injection](./threats/insecure_dependency_injection.md)

- Description: While Laravel's dependency injection is powerful, if not used carefully, it can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, injecting classes that perform sensitive operations without proper authorization checks can be exploited by an attacker who finds a way to trigger the execution of these injected classes.
- Impact: Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to functionalities.
- Affected Component: Dependency Injection container, controllers, services.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Ensure that injected dependencies are used securely and that authorization checks are performed within the controller methods or the injected classes themselves.
  - Follow the principle of least privilege when designing and implementing dependencies.
  - Thoroughly review the code of injected classes to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities.
