# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and deployment of web applications: Laravel is fundamental for enabling organizations to build and deploy web applications efficiently and securely. Any compromise to Laravel's integrity or availability directly impacts the ability to develop and maintain web services.
  - Secure web application functionality: Laravel provides security features that are crucial for protecting web applications from common vulnerabilities. Failures in these security features or vulnerabilities within Laravel itself can directly lead to breaches in applications built upon it.
  - Community and ecosystem trust: The Laravel framework relies heavily on community trust and a healthy ecosystem of packages and resources. Security incidents or lack of responsiveness to security issues can erode this trust, impacting adoption and the overall health of the Laravel ecosystem.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Laravel framework source code: Sensitivity: High. Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities being exploited in the framework itself, affecting all applications built with it. Integrity and confidentiality are important.
  - Security-related components and configurations: Sensitivity: High. Components like authentication, authorization, and cryptography need to be protected to ensure the security of applications. Confidentiality and integrity are paramount.
  - Build and deployment pipelines: Sensitivity: Medium to High. Compromise could lead to malicious code injection into the framework or applications. Integrity is crucial.
  - Metadata about vulnerabilities and security issues: Sensitivity: Medium. Confidentiality is important to prevent premature disclosure before patches are available, but transparency is also needed for the community.
  - Community contributions and packages: Sensitivity: Medium. Integrity is important to ensure that contributed code and packages are not malicious.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended risk appetite for the Laravel project? Is it geared towards startups with a higher risk tolerance or large enterprises with stricter security requirements?
  - What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that Laravel needs to adhere to, if any?
  - Are there specific threat actors that Laravel is particularly concerned about (e.g., nation-state actors, cybercriminals, script kiddies)?
  - What is the process for handling and disclosing security vulnerabilities in Laravel?
  - What is the expected level of security expertise among developers using Laravel?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and developer-friendly web framework that is widely adopted and supported by a strong community. Security is a high priority due to the potential impact of vulnerabilities on a large number of applications.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Laravel aims to provide a secure foundation for web applications by incorporating security best practices and features into the framework itself. However, it is assumed that application developers are ultimately responsible for implementing secure coding practices and configuring application-level security controls.
  - DESIGN: The design of Laravel is modular and component-based, allowing for flexibility and extensibility. The framework is designed to be deployed in various environments, from simple shared hosting to complex cloud infrastructures. The build process is automated and includes security checks to minimize supply chain risks.
