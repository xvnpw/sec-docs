# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for laravel/framework

## Mitigation Strategy: [Eloquent Model Attribute Control (`$fillable` / `$guarded`)](./mitigation_strategies/eloquent_model_attribute_control___$fillable____$guarded__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Models:**  Examine all Eloquent models within the `app/Models` directory (or your custom model location).
    2.  **Choose Strategy:** Decide whether to use `$fillable` (whitelist of allowed attributes) or `$guarded` (blacklist of disallowed attributes).  `$fillable` is generally preferred.
    3.  **Define Attributes:**  Within each model class, define either the `$fillable` or `$guarded` property as an array.  For `$fillable`, list *every* attribute that should be mass-assignable.  For `$guarded`, list attributes that *should not* be mass-assignable.  *Never* leave both undefined.
    4.  **Review Controller Logic:** Ensure controllers interacting with these models do *not* use `request()->all()` directly with `Model::create()` or `Model::update()`.
    5.  **Safe Data Handling:** Use `request()->only(['field1', 'field2', ...])` or manually assign attributes after validation.
    6.  **Form Requests (Optional but Framework-Specific):** Utilize Laravel's Form Request classes for complex validation and data handling before it reaches the model.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Mass Assignment:** (Severity: High) - Attackers inject data into unexpected database columns.
    *   **Data Tampering:** (Severity: Medium) - Attackers modify existing data in unintended ways.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Mass Assignment:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `app/Models/User.php`: `$fillable` defined.
    *   `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`: Uses `request()->only()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `app/Models/Product.php`: Neither `$fillable` nor `$guarded` is defined.
    *   `app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php`: Uses `Product::create(request()->all())`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection Enforcement (Using Laravel's Middleware and Directives)](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection_enforcement__using_laravel's_middleware_and_directives_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Middleware:** Confirm the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware is enabled in the `web` middleware group within `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
    2.  **Blade Forms:**  Use the `@csrf` Blade directive *inside* all `<form>` tags in your `.blade.php` files.
    3.  **AJAX Requests:** Include the CSRF token (obtained from `<meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">`) in the `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header for AJAX requests.
    4.  **API Routes (Sanctum/Passport):**  Use Laravel Sanctum or Passport for API authentication, which handles CSRF protection for API routes. *Do not* use the `web` middleware group for API security.
    5.  **Exemptions (Rare & Framework-Specific):** If disabling CSRF protection for specific routes (using `$except` in `VerifyCsrfToken`), document the reason clearly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `app/Http/Kernel.php`: `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware enabled.
    *   Blade forms include `@csrf`.
    *   AJAX requests include `X-CSRF-TOKEN` header.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   API routes currently use the `web` middleware group.  Needs to switch to Laravel Sanctum.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Session Configuration (Using Laravel's `config/session.php`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_session_configuration__using_laravel's__configsession_php__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Session Driver:** In `config/session.php`, choose a secure driver (`database`, `redis`, or `memcached` are recommended for production).
    2.  **Lifetime:** Set an appropriate session `lifetime` in `config/session.php`.
    3.  **Cookie Settings:** Ensure `http_only` and `secure` are set to `true` in `config/session.php`.
    4.  **Encryption:** Verify session encryption is enabled (default). Ensure a strong `APP_KEY` is set in `.env`.
    5.  **Regeneration (Framework Method):** After login, call `request()->session()->regenerate()`.
    6.  **Invalidation (Framework Method):** On logout, call `request()->session()->invalidate()`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Session Fixation:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Session Data Exposure:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Session Fixation:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Session Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `config/session.php`: Secure settings configured.
    *   Login/Logout controllers: Use `regenerate()` and `invalidate()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Route Model Binding (Using Laravel's Route Definitions and Scopes)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_route_model_binding__using_laravel's_route_definitions_and_scopes_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Routes:** Examine routes in `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php` using route model binding.
    2.  **Soft Deletes:** If models use soft deletes, be cautious.  Use global scopes or explicit binding with closures to exclude them if needed.
    3.  **Explicit Binding (Custom Keys):** Use explicit binding with custom keys: `Route::get('/users/{user:uuid}', ...)`
    4.  **Scopes (Framework Feature):** Use route model binding scopes to restrict queries (e.g., `Route::model('user', User::class)->scope('active');`).
    5.  **Validation:** Validate the resolved model in your controller or Form Request.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Exposure of Soft-Deleted Data:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Soft-Deleted Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `routes/web.php`: Uses explicit binding.
    *   Controllers validate resolved models.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `app/Models/Post.php`: Uses soft deletes without proper handling in route binding.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent Debugging Information Leaks (Using Laravel's Configuration and Tools)](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_debugging_information_leaks__using_laravel's_configuration_and_tools_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`APP_DEBUG`:** Set `APP_DEBUG=false` in your `.env` file for production.
    2.  **Debugging Tools:** Disable or restrict access to Laravel Telescope and Laravel Debugbar in production.
    3.  **Logging:** Configure `config/logging.php` with appropriate log levels for production (e.g., `error`).
    4.  **Remove Debugging Code:** Remove `dd()`, `dump()`, etc., from production code.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `.env` (production): `APP_DEBUG=false`.
    *   Telescope/Debugbar disabled in production.
    *   `config/logging.php`: Log level set to `error`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Redirects and Forwards (Using Laravel's `redirect()` and `route()` Helpers)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_redirects_and_forwards__using_laravel's__redirect____and__route____helpers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid User Input:** Do *not* directly use user input in `redirect()` or `route()` calls.
    2.  **Named Routes (Framework Feature):** Use named routes (e.g., `return redirect()->route('home');`).
    3.  **Whitelist:** If using user input, validate it against a whitelist.
    4.  **`intended()` (Framework Method):** Use `return redirect()->intended('/');` after authentication.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirect:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirect:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Named routes used extensively.
    *   `intended()` used after login.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   One controller method uses `redirect($request->input('return_url'))` without validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration and Secrets (Leveraging Laravel's Configuration System)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_and_secrets__leveraging_laravel's_configuration_system_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`.env` Exclusion:**  `.env` file *must not* be in version control.
    2.  **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables on the server.
    3.  **Configuration Caching (Framework Command):** Run `php artisan config:cache` in production. Clear with `php artisan config:clear` after changes.
    4.  **File Permissions:** Restrict access to `.env` and configuration files.
    5.  **Secrets Management (Consider external service, but configuration is within Laravel).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Configuration:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Configuration:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
