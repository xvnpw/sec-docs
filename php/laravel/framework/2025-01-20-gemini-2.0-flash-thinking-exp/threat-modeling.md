# Threat Model Analysis for laravel/framework

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might craft malicious request data to modify unintended database columns by exploiting Eloquent's mass assignment feature when not properly guarded. They could potentially elevate privileges, modify sensitive data, or inject malicious content.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized data modification.
*   **Affected Component:** Eloquent ORM, specifically Model attribute assignment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use the `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on Eloquent models to explicitly define which attributes can be mass-assigned.
    *   Utilize Form Requests for more granular control over input validation and authorization before data reaches the model.
    *   Avoid directly passing request input to model creation or update methods without proper filtering.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Blade](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_blade.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might inject malicious code into Blade templates if raw output (`{!! $variable !!}`) is used to display user-provided content without proper escaping, or if custom Blade directives introduce vulnerabilities. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Blade Templating Engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use the escaped output syntax (`{{ $variable }}`) for displaying user-provided content.
    *   Carefully review and sanitize any user input before passing it to raw output directives (`{!! !!}`).
    *   Thoroughly audit custom Blade directives for potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Application Key](./threats/insecure_default_application_key.md)

*   **Description:** If the default application key is not changed after installation, an attacker who obtains this key can decrypt data encrypted by the application or forge signed data, potentially leading to session hijacking or other attacks.
*   **Impact:** Data decryption, session manipulation, potential for unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Component:** Encryption Service, Session Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Generate a strong, unique application key (`APP_KEY`) during the initial setup of the application.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Composer Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_composer_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party packages used by the Laravel application, as managed by Composer.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Composer Dependency Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep all Composer dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
    *   Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `composer audit`.
    *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attacks](./threats/dependency_confusion_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** If an application uses private Composer packages, an attacker might upload a malicious package with the same name to a public repository. If the application's Composer configuration is not properly set up, it might inadvertently download and install the attacker's malicious package.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, supply chain compromise, potential for data theft or manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** Composer Dependency Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use private package repositories for internal packages.
    *   Configure Composer to prioritize private repositories.
    *   Utilize namespaces for internal packages to avoid naming conflicts.

## Threat: [Unsafe Unserialization of Queued Jobs](./threats/unsafe_unserialization_of_queued_jobs.md)

*   **Description:** If queued jobs contain serialized objects from untrusted sources and are processed without proper safeguards, an attacker might be able to inject malicious serialized data that, when unserialized, leads to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Queue System, Serialization.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid unserializing data from untrusted sources in queued jobs.
    *   Sign or encrypt queued job payloads to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.
    *   Consider using alternative job serialization methods if possible.

## Threat: [Outdated Framework Version](./threats/outdated_framework_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of the Laravel framework exposes the application to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or other security issues.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire Laravel Framework.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Laravel framework updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Regularly review release notes and security advisories for new vulnerabilities and updates.
