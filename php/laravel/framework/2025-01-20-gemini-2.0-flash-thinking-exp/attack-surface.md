# Attack Surface Analysis for laravel/framework

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can modify unintended database columns by manipulating request input data if Eloquent models are not properly protected.
    - **How Framework Contributes:** Laravel's Eloquent ORM provides the mass assignment feature, which, if not configured correctly using `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on models, can be exploited.
    - **Example:** An attacker sends a POST request with an unexpected field like `is_admin=1` which, if the model is not protected, could elevate their privileges.
    - **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized data modification.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        -  **Developers:** Explicitly define allowed fillable attributes using the `$fillable` property on Eloquent models.
        -  **Developers:** Alternatively, define guarded attributes using the `$guarded` property to block specific attributes from mass assignment.
        -  **Developers:** Avoid using mass assignment for sensitive attributes like user roles or permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Blade](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_blade.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into Blade templates if user-supplied data is directly rendered without proper escaping, leading to code execution on the server.
    - **How Framework Contributes:** Laravel's Blade templating engine offers features like raw output (`{!! $variable !!}`) which, if used carelessly with user input, can introduce SSTI vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** A user provides input like server-side code constructs which, if rendered using `!! $userInput !!`, could be executed on the server.
    - **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, server compromise.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        -  **Developers:** Always use the default escaped output (`{{ $variable }}`) for displaying user-provided data in Blade templates.
        -  **Developers:** Sanitize and validate user input before rendering it in Blade templates, even when using escaped output, to prevent other injection attacks.
        -  **Developers:** Avoid using raw output (`{!! $variable !!}`) with user-controlled data unless absolutely necessary and after rigorous sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Raw Queries or Improper Query Builder Usage](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_raw_queries_or_improper_query_builder_usage.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL commands into database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    - **How Framework Contributes:** While Laravel's Eloquent ORM provides protection against basic SQL injection through parameterized queries, using raw queries (`DB::raw()`) or constructing complex queries without proper parameter binding can introduce vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** Using `DB::raw("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" . $request->input('name') . "'")` directly embeds user input into the query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
    - **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, potential server compromise.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        -  **Developers:** Prefer using Eloquent's query builder with parameter binding for database interactions.
        -  **Developers:** When using `DB::raw()`, ensure that all user-provided data is properly sanitized and escaped using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
        -  **Developers:** Avoid concatenating user input directly into SQL query strings.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass via Middleware Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_via_middleware_misconfiguration.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can bypass authentication or authorization checks due to flaws or misconfigurations in custom middleware.
    - **How Framework Contributes:** Laravel's middleware system allows developers to define custom request processing logic, including authentication and authorization. Incorrectly implemented or overly permissive middleware can create vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** A middleware intended to restrict access to admin routes might have a logical flaw that allows users with a specific, non-admin role to bypass the check.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, privilege escalation.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        -  **Developers:** Thoroughly test custom middleware to ensure it correctly enforces authentication and authorization rules.
        -  **Developers:** Follow the principle of least privilege when defining middleware rules.
        -  **Developers:** Utilize Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Exposed Artisan Commands or Unsafe Unserialization](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__via_exposed_artisan_commands_or_unsafe_unserialization.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can occur if Artisan commands are exposed through web interfaces without proper authentication or if the application processes unserialized data from untrusted sources.
    - **How Framework Contributes:** Laravel's Artisan console provides powerful commands, some of which could be dangerous if exposed. Additionally, the framework might use serialization for tasks like queue processing, which can be vulnerable if not handled carefully.
    - **Example:** An attacker accesses an unprotected route that executes an Artisan command like `app:down` or exploits a vulnerability in how queue jobs are unserialized.
    - **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, service disruption.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        -  **Developers:** Never expose Artisan commands directly through web interfaces without robust authentication and authorization.
        -  **Developers:** Be extremely cautious when unserializing data from untrusted sources, as this can lead to RCE vulnerabilities. Consider using safer data formats like JSON for inter-process communication.
        -  **Developers:** Secure queue workers and ensure that only trusted data is processed.
