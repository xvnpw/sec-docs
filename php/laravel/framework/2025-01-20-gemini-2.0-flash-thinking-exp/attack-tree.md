*   Step 2: Craft malicious requests with unexpected input fields.
*   Step 3: Modify unintended database columns or create unexpected data. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization (if using specific features) **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization__if_using_specific_features___high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify if the application uses `unserialize()` or similar functions on user-controlled data (e.g., in sessions or queues).
*   Step 2: Craft malicious serialized objects.
*   Step 3: Trigger remote code execution or other vulnerabilities upon deserialization. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Authentication/Authorization Middleware **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_authenticationauthorization_middleware__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify weaknesses in custom authentication/authorization logic within middleware.
*   Step 2: Craft requests that circumvent the middleware's checks.
*   Step 3: Access protected resources or perform unauthorized actions. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti___high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify areas where user input is directly embedded into Blade templates without proper escaping.
*   Step 2: Craft malicious Blade syntax within the input.
*   Step 3: Execute arbitrary code on the server. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Fixation **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/session_fixation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Force a known session ID onto a user.
*   Step 2: Wait for the user to authenticate with the fixed session ID.
*   Step 3: Impersonate the user using the known session ID. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Session Storage (if customized)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_session_storage__if_customized_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify if a custom session driver is used.
*   Step 2: Analyze the custom driver for storage vulnerabilities (e.g., weak encryption, predictable storage).
*   Step 3: Access or manipulate session data. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection through User Input **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_through_user_input__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 2: Craft malicious input containing shell commands.
*   Step 3: Execute arbitrary commands on the server. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Accessing Sensitive Information via Debug Commands](./attack_tree_paths/accessing_sensitive_information_via_debug_commands.md)

*   Step 1: Identify debug-related Artisan commands (e.g., route:list, config:cache).
*   Step 2: Gain unauthorized access to execute these commands (e.g., through a compromised admin panel).
*   Step 3: Expose sensitive application information. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Accessing Sensitive Configuration Files **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/accessing_sensitive_configuration_files__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify potential locations of configuration files (.env, config/).
*   Step 2: Exploit vulnerabilities to access these files (e.g., directory traversal, misconfigured web server).
*   Step 3: Obtain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, etc. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Job Injection **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/job_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify if the application allows user-controlled data to influence job creation or processing.
*   Step 2: Craft malicious job payloads.
*   Step 3: Execute unintended code or actions through the queue system. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Insecure Job Processing Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_job_processing_logic.md)

*   Step 1: Analyze the logic within job handlers for vulnerabilities.
*   Step 2: Craft job payloads that exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   Step 3: Cause unintended consequences during job processing. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal during File Upload **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_during_file_upload__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify file upload functionalities.
*   Step 2: Craft malicious filenames containing path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../).
*   Step 3: Upload files to unintended locations on the server. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Uploading Malicious Files **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/uploading_malicious_files__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify file upload functionalities.
*   Step 2: Upload files containing malicious code (e.g., PHP scripts).
*   Step 3: Gain remote code execution by accessing the uploaded malicious file. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Predictable or Hardcoded Encryption Keys **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/predictable_or_hardcoded_encryption_keys__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Step 1: Identify if encryption keys are hardcoded or easily predictable.
*   Step 2: Obtain the encryption key.
*   Step 3: Decrypt sensitive data. **[CRITICAL NODE]**
