# Attack Surface Analysis for bookstackapp/bookstack

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Editor](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_editor.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into Bookstack pages through user-generated content, executed by users viewing the page.
    *   **Bookstack Contribution:** Bookstack's use of a Markdown editor for content creation (pages, books, chapters) directly introduces this attack surface if input sanitization is insufficient.
    *   **Example:** A user creates a Bookstack page with Markdown containing `<script>/* malicious script */</script>`. When another user views this page, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting to a malicious site.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of Bookstack content, redirection to malicious websites, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust server-side sanitization and output encoding of all user-provided Markdown content using a security-focused Markdown parsing library.
            *   Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script execution and resource loading, limiting XSS impact.
            *   Regularly update Markdown parsing libraries and Bookstack to patch any identified XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in Bookstack's file upload functionality to upload malicious files, potentially leading to code execution on the server or other attacks.
    *   **Bookstack Contribution:** Bookstack's feature allowing users to upload files as attachments and images directly contributes to this attack surface if file handling and validation are not properly implemented.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If Bookstack's server or file handling logic is flawed, this script could be executed, granting the attacker remote code execution on the Bookstack server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, unauthorized file access, data breaches, malware distribution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not solely on file extensions.
            *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities during file storage and retrieval.
            *   Store uploaded files outside the web root and serve them via a handler that prevents direct execution.
            *   Implement file size limits and rate limiting to mitigate denial-of-service risks through large file uploads.
            *   Consider integrating with antivirus scanning for uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing Bookstack's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the application without valid credentials.
    *   **Bookstack Contribution:** Vulnerabilities in Bookstack's core authentication logic, session management, or handling of authentication providers (local, LDAP, SAML) are direct Bookstack contributions to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A flaw in Bookstack's password reset functionality could allow an attacker to reset another user's password without proper authorization. A vulnerability in session management could lead to session hijacking or fixation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, data breaches, manipulation of content, full account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust and thoroughly tested authentication logic, adhering to security best practices for session management and credential handling.
            *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of authentication flows.
            *   Enforce strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.
            *   Implement and encourage multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced account security.
            *   Securely configure and regularly audit integrations with external authentication providers.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass / Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to resources or functionalities beyond a user's intended privileges within Bookstack, often by exploiting flaws in the permission model.
    *   **Bookstack Contribution:** Bookstack's role-based access control (RBAC) system, if not correctly implemented or enforced, directly contributes to this attack surface. Vulnerabilities here allow users to exceed their intended permissions.
    *   **Example:** A regular user exploits a vulnerability to gain administrative privileges, allowing them to manage all Bookstack content and user accounts. Or, a user accesses or modifies content in a book or chapter they should not have permission to view or edit.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification or deletion of critical content, administrative control takeover, significant data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Design and implement a well-defined and consistently enforced authorization model based on the principle of least privilege.
            *   Thoroughly test and audit authorization logic for all functionalities and access points within Bookstack.
            *   Ensure permission checks are performed securely on the server-side and cannot be bypassed through client-side manipulation.
            *   Regularly review and refine the RBAC implementation as new features are added.
        *   **Users/Administrators:**
            *   Carefully configure user roles and permissions, granting only the necessary level of access for each user.
            *   Regularly review user permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with user roles and responsibilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities into Bookstack through the use of outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries and components that Bookstack relies upon.
    *   **Bookstack Contribution:** Bookstack's dependency on various PHP and JavaScript libraries means vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly become part of Bookstack's attack surface if not managed properly.
    *   **Example:** Bookstack uses an outdated version of a PHP library with a known SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited to compromise Bookstack's database and sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the specific dependency vulnerability, including XSS, SQL injection, remote code execution, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement a robust dependency management process, including dependency pinning and version control.
            *   Regularly update all dependencies to the latest stable and patched versions.
            *   Utilize automated dependency scanning tools to identify and track known vulnerabilities in Bookstack's dependencies.
            *   Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for dependencies used by Bookstack and promptly apply updates.
        *   **Users/Administrators:**
            *   Ensure Bookstack is kept up-to-date with the latest releases, which include security patches and dependency updates.
            *   Monitor Bookstack's security announcements and apply updates in a timely manner.
