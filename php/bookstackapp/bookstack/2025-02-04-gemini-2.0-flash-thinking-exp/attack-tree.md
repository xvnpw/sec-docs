## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Password Policies & Brute-Force](./attack_tree_paths/weak_password_policies_&_brute-force.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weak or default password policies by attempting to guess user credentials through brute-force or dictionary attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Full account compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (Automated tools available)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring failed login attempts, account lockout mechanisms)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length).
    *   Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
    *   Monitor login attempts and alert on suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application inputs to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common web vulnerability)
*   **Impact:** High (Full database compromise, data exfiltration, data manipulation)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires identifying vulnerable input points, automated tools available)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High (Requires code analysis, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and monitoring database queries)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) for database interactions.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization.
    *   Regularly perform static and dynamic code analysis.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, allowing them to steal session cookies, redirect users, deface websites, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium-High (Very common in web applications, especially CMS)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Relatively easy to exploit, various tools and techniques available)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires Content Security Policy (CSP), input/output encoding, WAF, but subtle XSS can be missed)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of content the browser is allowed to load.
    *   Regularly perform security testing for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) to the server due to inadequate file type validation or insecure file handling, potentially leading to code execution, system compromise, or information disclosure.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common attack vector in applications with file upload functionality)
*   **Impact:** High (Remote code execution, full system compromise, data breach)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires identifying upload points, crafting malicious files)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires file type/size monitoring, antivirus scanning, web server logs analysis)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation using a whitelist approach.
    *   Sanitize filenames to prevent directory traversal attacks.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot.
    *   Perform antivirus scanning on uploaded files.
    *   Limit file size and upload frequency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use default usernames and passwords that are often set during initial software installation and are not changed by administrators, granting immediate unauthorized access.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium (Depends on administrator awareness, automated scans can find defaults)
*   **Impact:** High (Immediate full system access)
*   **Effort:** Low (Default credentials are often publicly known or easily guessable)
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Easily detectable if you know to look for default accounts)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Mandate changing default credentials during installation.
    *   Regularly audit for and remove/change any remaining default accounts.
    *   Implement automated checks for default credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Server Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_server_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or PHP settings can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to gain access or disrupt service. Examples include directory listing enabled, insecure permissions, outdated software, or exposed management interfaces.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common if not using hardened configurations)
*   **Impact:** High (Full server compromise, data breach, service disruption)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires server scanning, configuration analysis)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires security audits, configuration checks, vulnerability scanning)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Follow security best practices for web server and PHP configuration.
    *   Harden the server environment (disable unnecessary modules, services).
    *   Regularly update server software and apply security patches.
    *   Perform regular security audits and configuration reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or encryption keys, is stored in configuration files that are accessible to unauthorized users or processes, potentially leading to full system compromise or data breaches.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Configuration mistakes happen, especially in deployments)
*   **Impact:** High (Full system compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to services)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Requires finding configuration files, often through misconfigurations or exposed directories)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium (Requires file system checks, configuration audits, access control reviews)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Securely store configuration files outside the webroot.
    *   Restrict access to configuration files to only necessary users/processes.
    *   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions instead of storing secrets directly in files.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable PHP Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_php_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** BookStack relies on third-party PHP libraries managed by Composer. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited to compromise the application if not properly managed and updated.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies often have vulnerabilities, requires active management)
*   **Impact:** High (Application compromise, data breach, service disruption, depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries, automated tools available)
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (Using vulnerability scanners, exploiting might be harder depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Vulnerability scanners, security advisories, dependency audits)
*   **Mitigation Actions:**
    *   Regularly update BookStack and its dependencies using Composer.
    *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability management processes.
    *   Monitor security advisories for PHP libraries used by BookStack.
    *   Use tools like `composer audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.
