# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bookstackapp/bookstack

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Markdown Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/strict_markdown_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Bookstack's Markdown Parser:** Identify the specific Markdown parsing library used by Bookstack (likely in PHP).
    2.  **Audit Sanitization Configuration:** Examine Bookstack's configuration for the Markdown parser. Ensure it's configured with strict sanitization rules. Specifically, verify:
        *   **Limited Allowed HTML Tags:** Only a minimal set of safe HTML tags are permitted (e.g., `p`, `em`, `strong`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `a`, `img`, `code`, `pre`, `blockquote`, `h1`-`h6`).
        *   **Attribute Whitelisting and Sanitization:**  For allowed tags, only safe attributes are permitted (e.g., `href`, `src`, `alt`). Attribute values are sanitized to prevent JavaScript injection (e.g., blocking `javascript:` URLs).
        *   **Removal of Dangerous Constructs:**  Potentially harmful Markdown/HTML elements like raw HTML, iframes, and object/embed tags are completely removed or encoded.
    3.  **Strengthen Sanitization Rules (If Needed):** If the current configuration is insufficient, enhance the sanitization rules to be more restrictive. Consult the documentation of the Markdown parsing library for advanced sanitization options.
    4.  **Regularly Update Parser Library:** Keep the Markdown parsing library used by Bookstack updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown (High Severity):** Malicious users inject JavaScript code through Bookstack's Markdown editor, affecting other users viewing the content.

    *   **Likely Partially Implemented in Bookstack:** Bookstack uses Markdown and likely has some sanitization. The extent and effectiveness need to be verified.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Verification and Hardening of Sanitization:** Developers need to audit the current Markdown sanitization in Bookstack, test its effectiveness against XSS payloads, and strengthen the rules if necessary.
    *   **Automated Testing for Sanitization:** Implement automated tests that specifically check the Markdown sanitization to ensure it remains effective after updates to Bookstack or the parsing library.
