# Threat Model Analysis for bookstackapp/bookstack

## Threat: [Markdown Parsing XSS](./threats/markdown_parsing_xss.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious Markdown content within BookStack (e.g., in a page). When BookStack parses and renders this content, it executes arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user viewing that content. This is due to vulnerabilities in how BookStack handles and renders Markdown.

**Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, further propagation of attacks.

**Affected Component:** The Markdown parsing library and content rendering module within BookStack.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the Markdown parsing library used by BookStack.
* Implement robust output encoding and sanitization of content after Markdown parsing but before rendering in the browser, specifically within BookStack's rendering pipeline.
* Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources when displaying BookStack content.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload (if enabled/customized within BookStack)](./threats/malicious_file_upload__if_enabledcustomized_within_bookstack_.md)

**Description:** If BookStack's functionality is extended (through customization or potential future plugins) to allow file uploads, an attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) that, if accessible and executed by the web server, could lead to remote code execution on the server hosting BookStack. This threat is specific to how BookStack handles uploaded files.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach.

**Affected Component:** The file upload handling module within BookStack (if implemented).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers), not just file extensions, within BookStack's upload handling logic.
* Store uploaded files outside the webroot of the BookStack installation to prevent direct execution by the web server.
* Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files within BookStack.
* Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software integrated with BookStack's upload process.

## Threat: [Content Access Bypass via Structure Manipulation](./threats/content_access_bypass_via_structure_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the hierarchical structure of shelves, books, chapters, and pages within BookStack in a way that circumvents the intended access control mechanisms. This could involve moving restricted content to less restricted areas, exploiting flaws in how BookStack enforces permissions based on the content structure.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information managed within BookStack.

**Affected Component:** The permission enforcement logic and content management module within BookStack.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust and consistent permission checks at each level of the content hierarchy within BookStack.
* Thoroughly test permission inheritance and overrides when moving or restructuring content within BookStack.
* Regularly audit content permissions and structure within BookStack.

## Threat: [External Authentication Bypass](./threats/external_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** If BookStack is configured to use external authentication providers (like LDAP or SAML), vulnerabilities in BookStack's integration logic could allow an attacker to bypass the external authentication process and gain unauthorized access to accounts within BookStack. This could involve flaws in how BookStack validates responses from the provider or manages sessions after external authentication.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to the BookStack application and its data.

**Affected Component:** The authentication module and the specific integration logic for external authentication providers within BookStack.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow security best practices for integrating with external authentication providers specifically within the BookStack context.
* Securely store and manage any necessary credentials or keys for the integration within BookStack's configuration.
* Regularly update the libraries and components used for external authentication within BookStack.
* Implement thorough validation of responses from the authentication provider within BookStack's authentication flow.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking due to BookStack-Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/session_hijacking_due_to_bookstack-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** BookStack might have specific implementation details in its session management that introduce vulnerabilities, such as predictable session IDs or insecure storage of session data (beyond standard cookie security). An attacker could exploit these BookStack-specific weaknesses to steal a legitimate user's session and impersonate them within the BookStack application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, account takeover, ability to perform actions as the compromised user within BookStack.

**Affected Component:** The session management module within BookStack.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure strong, unpredictable session IDs are generated by BookStack.
* Securely store session data (e.g., using HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies, and secure server-side storage) within BookStack's session management.
* Implement session timeout mechanisms within BookStack.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Role Management Flaws](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_role_management_flaws.md)

**Description:** If BookStack's role and permission management system has flaws, an attacker with a lower-privileged account might be able to exploit these flaws within BookStack to elevate their privileges to gain unauthorized access to more sensitive data or administrative functions within the application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, potential compromise of the BookStack installation.

**Affected Component:** The role and permission management module within BookStack.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a well-defined and granular role-based access control system within BookStack.
* Thoroughly test the role assignment and permission enforcement logic within BookStack for any vulnerabilities.
* Regularly audit user roles and permissions within BookStack.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through BookStack Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_bookstack_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Configuration files used by BookStack might contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys for integrated services, or other secrets. If these files are not properly protected on the server hosting BookStack, attackers could potentially access them and retrieve this sensitive information.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of the BookStack installation or other connected systems.

**Affected Component:** The configuration file handling mechanism within BookStack.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store sensitive configuration information securely, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools, rather than directly in configuration files accessible by the web server.
* Ensure configuration files are not directly accessible through the web server by placing them outside the webroot of the BookStack installation and configuring web server access rules.
* Restrict file system permissions on BookStack's configuration files to only allow necessary access.
