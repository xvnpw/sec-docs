# Attack Surface Analysis for bookstackapp/bookstack

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Generated Content](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-generated_content.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts injected by users are stored in the application's database and executed when other users view the affected content.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:** BookStack allows users to create and edit content (books, chapters, pages, comments) using Markdown, which can include HTML. If not properly sanitized by BookStack's rendering engine, malicious scripts can be embedded.
    *   **Example:** A user injects `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a page's content. When another user views that page, the alert box appears.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise (session hijacking), redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data, especially in Markdown content, custom fields, and comments within BookStack's codebase.
            *   Use context-aware output encoding when rendering user-generated content (e.g., escaping HTML entities) within BookStack's view layer.
            *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, configured within BookStack's response headers.
            *   Regularly update the Markdown parsing library used by BookStack to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Potential SQL Injection in Custom Field Handling or Search Functionality](./attack_surfaces/potential_sql_injection_in_custom_field_handling_or_search_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries through input fields, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:** BookStack allows users to define custom fields and provides a search functionality. If BookStack's code doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize database queries based on user input in these features, SQL injection vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious string in a custom field or search query that, when processed by BookStack's database interaction layer, executes unintended SQL commands.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (access to sensitive information), data manipulation, potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements)** for database interactions involving user input within BookStack's data access layer. This prevents the interpretation of user input as SQL code.
            *   Implement strict input validation within BookStack's input processing logic to ensure data conforms to expected types and formats before being used in database queries.
            *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts used by BookStack.
            *   Regularly audit database queries within BookStack's codebase for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) to the server, which can then be executed, allowing them to gain control of the server.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:** BookStack allows users to upload images and attachments. If BookStack's upload handling logic doesn't restrict the types of files that can be uploaded or if uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible location and can be executed by the web server due to BookStack's file storage configuration, this vulnerability exists.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script containing a backdoor through BookStack's upload functionality and then accesses it through a web browser, executing the script on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, defacement, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers) and not just file extensions within BookStack's upload processing.
            *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root, configured within BookStack's file storage settings or deployment scripts.
            *   Provide guidance and configuration options to administrators on how to configure the web server to prevent the execution of scripts in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` for Apache or appropriate configurations for other servers).
            *   Consider implementing antivirus scanning on uploaded files within BookStack's upload pipeline.
            *   Rename uploaded files within BookStack's upload handling to prevent predictable access paths.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Password Reset Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_password_reset_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the password reset process can allow attackers to reset other users' passwords and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:** BookStack provides a password reset functionality. If BookStack's code generates predictable reset tokens, doesn't securely generate them, or if the process lacks proper validation within BookStack's authentication logic, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker can guess or intercept a password reset token generated by BookStack and use it to reset another user's password.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Generate strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens within BookStack's password reset functionality.
            *   Use secure methods for transmitting reset links (HTTPS should be enforced by BookStack's configuration).
            *   Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed reset attempts within BookStack's authentication logic.
            *   Require users to confirm the password reset through a secondary factor (e.g., email confirmation) implemented within BookStack's password reset workflow.
