## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access.md)

* **Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access**
    * This is a fundamental objective for attackers as it provides the initial foothold into the application. Success here enables a wide range of subsequent attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities**
    * Weaknesses in the authentication mechanism are direct pathways for attackers to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

* **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed)**
    * Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to log in using commonly known default usernames and passwords that may not have been changed during the initial setup or by administrators.
    * Why High-Risk: This is a highly likely attack if default credentials are not changed, requiring minimal effort and skill. Successful exploitation grants full access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Logic Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_logic_flaws.md)

* **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Authentication Logic Flaws**
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit flaws in the design or implementation of the authentication process. This could include vulnerabilities in password reset mechanisms, session management, multi-factor authentication bypasses, or other logical errors that allow bypassing the intended authentication flow.
    * Why High-Risk: While requiring more skill than exploiting default credentials, successful exploitation directly leads to unauthorized access, a high-impact outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in WYSIWYG editor or user-generated content](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_wysiwyg_editor_or_user-generated_content.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in WYSIWYG editor or user-generated content**
    * Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious scripts into content that is later viewed by other users. This can be done through the WYSIWYG editor or by exploiting insufficient sanitization of user-generated content.
    * Why High-Risk: While the immediate impact is often medium (e.g., content defacement, session hijacking), XSS can be a stepping stone for more severe attacks, including account compromise and further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure File Upload Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_file_upload_functionality.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Insecure File Upload Functionality**
    * Weaknesses in how the application handles file uploads can be a direct route to severe compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Files (e.g., web shells)](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_files__e_g___web_shells_.md)

* **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Upload Malicious Files (e.g., web shells)**
    * Attack Vector: Attackers upload files containing malicious code (e.g., web shells, scripts) that can be executed by the server.
    * Why High-Risk: This is a common and relatively easy way for attackers to gain remote code execution, leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code.md)

* **Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Code**
    * This represents the highest level of compromise, allowing the attacker to run commands directly on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities (as mentioned above) -> Upload and Execute Malicious Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_vulnerabilities__as_mentioned_above__-_upload_and_execute_malicious_scripts.md)

* **High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities (as mentioned above) -> Upload and Execute Malicious Scripts**
    * Attack Vector: As described above, successful exploitation of file upload vulnerabilities allows attackers to upload and then execute malicious scripts on the server.
    * Why High-Risk: This path directly leads to remote code execution, granting the attacker significant control over the server and the application.
