# Threat Model Analysis for bookstackapp/bookstack

## Threat: [Insufficient Granular Permissions Control](./threats/insufficient_granular_permissions_control.md)

**Description:** An attacker, with legitimate but limited access, exploits the lack of fine-grained control in BookStack's permission system. They might attempt to perform actions or access content they are not intended to, such as deleting entire books when they only have editing rights on pages, or viewing restricted content within a book they have partial access to.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to or modification of sensitive information, potentially leading to data breaches, data loss, or defacement of content.

**Affected Component:**  BookStack's Permission System (specifically the role-based access control logic and its implementation across different content types like books, chapters, and pages).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement more granular role-based access controls, allowing administrators to define precise permissions for different actions (view, create, edit, delete) on specific content elements (books, chapters, pages, shelves).
*   Review and refine the existing permission model to ensure it adequately covers various access scenarios and prevents unintended privilege escalation.
*   Conduct thorough testing of the permission system to identify and address any loopholes.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass via Crafted URLs](./threats/authorization_bypass_via_crafted_urls.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates URL parameters or path segments to bypass authorization checks within BookStack. They might craft URLs to access or modify resources they are not authorized for, such as directly accessing an edit page for a book they only have read access to by altering the URL.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information or the ability to perform unauthorized actions, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or system instability.

**Affected Component:**  BookStack's Routing and Authorization Middleware (the components responsible for interpreting URLs and enforcing access controls).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust server-side authorization checks within BookStack that do not rely solely on URL parameters or predictable patterns.
*   Utilize secure coding practices to validate all user inputs and ensure that authorization is enforced before processing requests.
*   Employ access control lists (ACLs) or similar mechanisms to explicitly define access permissions for each resource within BookStack.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Embedded Content](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_embedded_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker with content creation privileges within BookStack embeds malicious content, such as an iframe or image tag with a crafted URL, into a BookStack page. When another user views this page, the BookStack server makes a request to the attacker-controlled URL, potentially allowing the attacker to scan internal networks, access internal services, or perform actions on behalf of the BookStack server.

**Impact:** Exposure of internal network infrastructure, unauthorized access to internal services, potential for further exploitation of internal systems stemming from the BookStack server.

**Affected Component:** BookStack's Content Rendering Engine (specifically the part that handles embedding external resources like images and iframes).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided URLs used for embedding content within BookStack.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources.
*   Consider using a proxy service or a dedicated service for fetching external resources to isolate the BookStack server from direct external requests.

## Threat: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via BookStack Specific Features](./threats/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_bookstack_specific_features.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages specific BookStack features, such as custom HTML blocks or potentially flawed markdown parsing within BookStack, to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored within the BookStack database. When other users view the affected content, the malicious script executes in their browsers.

**Impact:**  Account compromise (session hijacking) within the BookStack application, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of BookStack content, or execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser within the BookStack context.

**Affected Component:** BookStack's Content Editing and Rendering Modules (specifically the components responsible for parsing and displaying user-generated content, including markdown and HTML).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust server-side output encoding and sanitization for all user-generated content before rendering it in the browser within BookStack.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks within BookStack.
*   Carefully review and sanitize any features within BookStack that allow users to embed custom HTML or JavaScript.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of File Uploads Specific to BookStack](./threats/insecure_handling_of_file_uploads_specific_to_bookstack.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., an HTML file containing JavaScript, a PHP file if server-side execution is possible, or a file with a misleading extension) through BookStack's file upload functionality. If the BookStack server does not properly validate the file type or if the files are served without proper `Content-Type` headers, the malicious file could be executed by the user's browser or the server.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (if HTML), potential for remote code execution on the BookStack server (depending on server configuration and file handling), or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** BookStack's File Upload and Serving Modules (the components responsible for handling file uploads, storage, and delivery).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict server-side validation of file types based on content rather than just the file extension within BookStack.
*   Store uploaded files outside of the webroot and serve them through a separate handler within BookStack that enforces appropriate `Content-Type` headers (e.g., `application/octet-stream` for unknown types or `text/plain` for text files).
*   Consider using a dedicated storage service for uploaded files accessed by BookStack.
*   Scan uploaded files for malware if feasible within the BookStack environment.

## Threat: [API Key or Token Leakage Specific to BookStack (If Applicable)](./threats/api_key_or_token_leakage_specific_to_bookstack__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If BookStack utilizes API keys or tokens for internal communication or integrations, vulnerabilities in their management or storage within BookStack could lead to leakage. An attacker might find these keys in BookStack configuration files, code repositories, or exposed through error messages, allowing them to impersonate BookStack or access connected services.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to BookStack's internal functionalities or integrated services, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation within the BookStack context.

**Affected Component:** BookStack's API Integration and Configuration Management (the components responsible for managing and utilizing API keys or tokens).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store API keys and tokens securely, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions within the BookStack deployment.
*   Avoid hardcoding API keys in the BookStack codebase.
*   Implement proper access controls and logging for API key usage within BookStack.
*   Regularly rotate API keys used by BookStack.

## Threat: [Default Credentials or Insecure Default Configurations Specific to BookStack](./threats/default_credentials_or_insecure_default_configurations_specific_to_bookstack.md)

**Description:** A newly installed BookStack instance might have default administrative credentials that are not changed or insecure default configurations that expose vulnerabilities within BookStack itself. An attacker could exploit these defaults to gain unauthorized administrative access to the BookStack system.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the BookStack instance, including access to all data and administrative functionalities.

**Affected Component:** BookStack's Installation and Initial Setup Procedures.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Force users to change default administrative credentials during the initial BookStack setup process.
*   Review default BookStack configurations and ensure they adhere to security best practices.
*   Provide clear documentation on recommended security configurations for BookStack.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the BookStack Update Process](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_bookstack_update_process.md)

**Description:** The process of updating BookStack itself might have vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate the update process to inject malicious code or compromise the BookStack system during the update.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the BookStack instance.

**Affected Component:** BookStack's Update Mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that BookStack updates are delivered over secure channels (HTTPS).
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., using cryptographic signatures) to verify the authenticity of BookStack update packages.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing the BookStack update mechanism.
