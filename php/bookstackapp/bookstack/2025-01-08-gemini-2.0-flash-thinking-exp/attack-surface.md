# Attack Surface Analysis for bookstackapp/bookstack

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markdown_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the library BookStack uses to render Markdown content can be exploited to inject malicious code.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:** BookStack relies on Markdown for user-generated content, making the parsing library a critical component.
    *   **Example:** A user crafts a Markdown link with a malicious `javascript:` URL, which, when rendered, executes arbitrary JavaScript in another user's browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
    *   **Impact:**  XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update the Markdown parsing library to the latest version with security patches. Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding specifically for Markdown rendering. Consider using a sandboxed rendering environment.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about embedding external content or links from untrusted sources, even within Markdown.

## Attack Surface: [HTML Injection via Custom HTML](./attack_surfaces/html_injection_via_custom_html.md)

*   **Description:** BookStack allows embedding custom HTML in certain areas (e.g., custom head content, potentially within specific blocks). If not properly sanitized, this can be exploited.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:**  Providing the ability to add custom HTML, while offering flexibility, introduces the risk of injection.
    *   **Example:** An administrator with permission to modify site settings injects a `<script>` tag into the custom head content, allowing them to execute JavaScript on every page load for all users.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the application's frontend, ability to inject malicious scripts for all users, potentially leading to credential theft or data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all custom HTML input. Use a secure templating engine that automatically escapes HTML by default. Consider limiting the use of custom HTML or providing safer alternatives.
        *   **Users:**  Restrict access to features that allow custom HTML to only highly trusted administrators. Carefully review any custom HTML before implementing it.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Upload (Specifically Images)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_upload__specifically_images_.md)

*   **Description:**  Uploading files, even seemingly harmless images, can be dangerous if the application doesn't properly validate and handle them.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:** BookStack allows users to upload images for use within documentation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image processing library used by BookStack. This could lead to remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, denial of service, or serving malware to other users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust file validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just extensions. Use a dedicated and sandboxed service for image processing. Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate, restricted domain. Regularly update image processing libraries.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about uploading files from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Flaws in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation](./attack_surfaces/flaws_in_role-based_access_control__rbac__implementation.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in how BookStack manages user roles and permissions can lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:** BookStack's core functionality relies on its RBAC system to control access to books, chapters, and shelves.
    *   **Example:** A bug in the permission checking logic allows a user with "viewer" permissions to edit content they should only be able to read.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, data modification or deletion by unauthorized users, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Thoroughly review and test the RBAC implementation. Follow the principle of least privilege. Implement clear and well-defined roles and permissions. Conduct regular security audits of the permission system.
        *   **Users:** Understand the permission model and report any unexpected access behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Administration Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/administration_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The administrative interface provides privileged access to manage the BookStack instance. Vulnerabilities here are critical.
    *   **How BookStack Contributes:** BookStack has an administrative interface for configuration, user management, and other critical tasks.
    *   **Example:** The admin login page is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to a lack of account lockout mechanisms. Or, an authenticated admin user can upload a malicious plugin that allows for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the BookStack instance, including data, configurations, and potentially the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the admin interface, including multi-factor authentication. Enforce strong password policies. Implement account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks. Regularly audit admin functionalities for security vulnerabilities. Restrict access to the admin interface to specific IP addresses or networks if possible.
        *   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts. Enable multi-factor authentication. Restrict access to the admin interface. Keep the BookStack instance updated with the latest security patches.
