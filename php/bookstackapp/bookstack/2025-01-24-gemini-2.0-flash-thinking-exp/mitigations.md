    *   In-application notifications or dashboards within Bookstack to alert administrators about available updates and security advisories.
    *   Potentially offering automated update mechanisms (with user consent and testing options) for simpler update management, especially for smaller deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration *for Bookstack*](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__configuration_for_bookstack.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure CSP Header in Web Server:**  While CSP is configured at the web server level, it is specifically *for* the Bookstack application. Configure your web server (Apache, Nginx) to send a Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header in responses served for your Bookstack domain.
    2.  **Define Bookstack-Specific CSP Directives:** Tailor the CSP directives to Bookstack's needs. Start with a restrictive policy and adjust as needed, ensuring Bookstack functionality is not broken. Example directives (adjust based on Bookstack's actual resource needs):
        *   `default-src 'self';`
        *   `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';` (Use `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` cautiously, only if Bookstack requires them and understand the risks. Ideally, avoid them if possible and refine CSP to be stricter).
        *   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';` (Similarly, use `'unsafe-inline'` for styles cautiously).
        *   `img-src 'self' data:;`
        *   `font-src 'self';`
        *   `frame-ancestors 'none';`
    3.  **Test and Refine CSP:** Thoroughly test your CSP configuration with Bookstack. Use browser developer tools to identify and resolve any CSP violations while ensuring Bookstack functions correctly.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High)
    *   Clickjacking (Severity: Medium)
    *   Data Injection Attacks (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High reduction
    *   Clickjacking: Medium reduction
    *   Data Injection Attacks: Medium reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, not by default. CSP configuration is an administrative task to be implemented on the web server serving Bookstack.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Bookstack could provide example CSP configurations or guidance tailored to its specific resource loading requirements to simplify CSP setup for administrators.
    *   Potentially offer a basic CSP configuration interface within the Bookstack admin settings (more complex implementation).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting *for Bookstack Login Attempts*](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_for_bookstack_login_attempts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Web Server Rate Limiting for Login Endpoint:** Configure rate limiting at the web server level (e.g., using Nginx's `limit_req_module`) specifically targeting the Bookstack login endpoint (e.g., `/login` or similar path - check Bookstack documentation for the exact login URL).
    2.  **Set Login Attempt Rate Limits:** Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a specific timeframe (e.g., 5 failed attempts in 5 minutes).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High)
    *   Credential Stuffing (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: High reduction
    *   Credential Stuffing: Medium reduction
