# Attack Surface Analysis for bookstackapp/bookstack

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored XSS](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__-_stored_xss.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious JavaScript into BookStack's stored content (pages, comments, descriptions), which executes when other users view that content.
    *   **BookStack Contribution:** BookStack's core function is content creation and editing, making it inherently vulnerable to stored XSS if input sanitization is flawed. The WYSIWYG editor and any free-text input fields are prime targets.
    *   **Example:** An attacker adds a page containing a malicious `<script>` tag that steals cookies. When another user views the page, the script executes, sending their cookies to the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, theft of sensitive information displayed on the page.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust output encoding (context-sensitive escaping) for *all* user-supplied data. Use a well-vetted and actively maintained HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify, properly configured). Regularly review and update sanitization rules. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit script execution.
        *   **User:** Keep BookStack updated.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass / Weak Authentication](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__weak_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing BookStack's authentication to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **BookStack Contribution:** BookStack's custom authentication logic (password management, session handling, social login/LDAP/SAML integrations) introduces potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a flaw in the password reset flow, using a weak/default password, or intercepting a poorly secured session cookie.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the compromised account, access to all content, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Enforce strong password policies. Implement secure password reset (short-lived, cryptographically secure tokens). Use secure session management (HTTPS-only cookies, secure random IDs, proper expiration/invalidation). Thoroughly test/audit all authentication code, including integrations. Provide and encourage Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
        *   **User:** Use strong, unique passwords. Enable MFA. Log out when finished.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass (Privilege Escalation)](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** A user gaining access to content or functionality they shouldn't have.
    *   **BookStack Contribution:** BookStack's permission system is central to its operation. Flaws in this system are a direct vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A "read-only" user modifying pages due to a bug in the permission checks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification/deletion of content, access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust, centralized authorization checks *before* any action. Use a consistent permission model. Regularly audit authorization logic and conduct penetration testing. Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   **User:** Report suspected permission issues.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious SQL into database queries.
    *   **BookStack Contribution:** While BookStack likely uses an ORM, custom SQL or improper input handling (especially in search or custom integrations) could lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects SQL code into a search field to extract data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data theft/modification/deletion, potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* database interactions. Avoid string concatenation for SQL. If using an ORM, ensure secure configuration and review custom SQL. Implement input validation.
        *   **User:** (No direct user mitigation).

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Uploading malicious files (e.g., web shells) executable on the server.
    *   **BookStack Contribution:** BookStack's file upload feature (for images, attachments) is a direct attack vector if not properly secured.
    *   **Example:** Uploading a PHP file containing a web shell, which is then executed.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data theft/modification, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict file type validation (whitelist *and* content type verification). Limit file sizes. Store uploads outside the web root or with restricted execution permissions. Scan for malware. Rename uploaded files.
        *   **User:** (No direct user mitigation).
