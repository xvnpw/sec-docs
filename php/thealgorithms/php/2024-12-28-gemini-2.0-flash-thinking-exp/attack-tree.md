**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in Algorithm Implementation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This represents a broad category of attacks targeting flaws within the logic of the algorithms implemented in the library. Successful exploitation here can lead to incorrect behavior or resource exhaustion.

*   **Trigger Logic Error in Algorithm (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   Attackers analyze the algorithm's code to identify specific inputs or conditions that cause the algorithm to deviate from its intended behavior. This could involve edge cases, incorrect handling of specific data ranges, or flaws in the algorithm's logic itself.

*   **Provide Specific Input to Cause Unexpected Behavior (HIGH-RISK PATH START):**
    *   This is the initial step in exploiting a logic error. The attacker crafts specific input data designed to trigger the identified flaw in the algorithm, leading to incorrect output or unexpected program state.

*   **Exploit Resource Consumption Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START):**
    *   This attack vector focuses on exploiting the computational or memory requirements of certain algorithms. By providing specific input, an attacker can force the algorithm to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service.

*   **Cause CPU Exhaustion (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   Attackers identify algorithms with high time complexity (e.g., O(n^2), O(n!)) and provide input that maximizes the number of operations the algorithm needs to perform. This can tie up the server's CPU, making the application unresponsive.

*   **Provide Input Leading to Excessive Computation (HIGH-RISK PATH START):**
    *   This is the initial action to cause CPU exhaustion. The attacker crafts input specifically designed to trigger the worst-case time complexity of a vulnerable algorithm.

*   **Cause Memory Exhaustion (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   Attackers identify algorithms that allocate significant amounts of memory based on their input. By providing input that leads to large data structures or inefficient memory allocation, they can exhaust the server's available memory, causing crashes or instability.

*   **Provide Input Leading to Excessive Memory Allocation (HIGH-RISK PATH START):**
    *   This is the initial action to cause memory exhaustion. The attacker crafts input that forces the algorithm to allocate an unreasonable amount of memory.

*   **Exploit Potential for Code Injection (Less Likely in Pure Algorithm Library) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   While less likely in a library focused on algorithms, this node highlights the critical risk if the library were to use dynamic code execution.

*   **If Library Uses `eval()` or Similar Constructs (Highly Unlikely but Worth Considering) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START):**
    *   This node represents the presence of dangerous functions like `eval()`, `assert()` with string arguments, or similar constructs that allow for the execution of arbitrary code.

*   **Inject Malicious Code Through Input Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   If dynamic code execution is present, attackers can craft input that includes malicious code. When this input is processed by the vulnerable function (e.g., `eval()`), the attacker's code is executed on the server, leading to a complete compromise.
