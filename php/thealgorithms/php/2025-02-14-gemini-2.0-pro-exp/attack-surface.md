# Attack Surface Analysis for thealgorithms/php

## Attack Surface: [Algorithmic Complexity Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/algorithmic_complexity_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit algorithms with poor worst-case time complexity (e.g., O(n^2)) to cause excessive CPU consumption, leading to a denial of service.
*How PHP Contributes:* PHP's single-threaded nature makes it highly susceptible to CPU-bound DoS.  The library's PHP implementations of algorithms, without proper input validation or algorithmic safeguards, are directly exploitable.  PHP's lack of built-in, easily configurable resource limits per request exacerbates the issue.
*Example:* An attacker provides a large, nearly reverse-sorted array to a PHP function using Bubble Sort (from the library).  The PHP process becomes unresponsive, unable to handle other requests.
*Impact:* Service unavailability; potential for complete application failure.
*Risk Severity:* High (potentially Critical if no other DoS protections are in place).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developer:*
        *   Use algorithms with better worst-case performance (e.g., Merge Sort, Heap Sort) *within the PHP code*.
        *   Implement strict input size limits *within the PHP functions*.
        *   Implement timeouts for algorithm execution *in the PHP code*.
        *   Use a robust Quick Sort implementation (randomized pivot) *in PHP*.
        *   Consider asynchronous processing or worker queues (if feasible) to offload computationally intensive PHP tasks.
    *   *User/Administrator:*
        *   Configure PHP's `max_execution_time` and `memory_limit` to reasonable values.
        *   Implement rate limiting and other DoS protection mechanisms at the web server or application level (e.g., WAF) â€“ these are *general* mitigations, but crucial given PHP's vulnerability.

## Attack Surface: [Hash Collision DoS (Dictionary/Hash Table Attacks)](./attack_surfaces/hash_collision_dos__dictionaryhash_table_attacks_.md)

*Description:* Attackers craft input data that causes many keys to hash to the same bucket in a hash table, degrading performance to O(n) and causing a DoS.
*How PHP Contributes:* This vulnerability is *entirely* dependent on the *PHP implementation* of the hash table within the `thealgorithms/php` library. If the PHP code uses a weak hashing function or handles collisions poorly, PHP's performance will suffer directly.
*Example:* An attacker provides a set of strings specifically designed to collide using the library's PHP hash table implementation. Insertions/lookups become extremely slow in PHP, leading to a DoS.
*Impact:* Service degradation or unavailability.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developer:*
        *   Ensure the *PHP* hash table implementation uses a strong, well-distributed hashing function.
        *   Implement robust collision resolution in *PHP* (e.g., chaining with balanced trees, or open addressing with good probing).
        *   Strongly consider using a well-vetted external *PHP* library for hash table functionality, rather than the `thealgorithms/php` implementation if security is paramount.
    *   *User/Administrator:*
        *   Monitor application performance for signs of hash collision attacks (slowdowns related to PHP processing).

## Attack Surface: [Recursion-Based Stack Overflow](./attack_surfaces/recursion-based_stack_overflow.md)

*Description:* Attackers provide input that triggers excessive recursion in a recursive algorithm implemented in PHP, leading to a stack overflow and application crash.
*How PHP Contributes:* PHP has a limited stack size. Recursive algorithms *within the library's PHP code*, if not carefully designed with base cases and depth limits, can easily exhaust the PHP stack.
*Example:* An attacker provides input to a PHP function (from the library) that uses a deeply nested recursive tree traversal, exceeding PHP's stack limit.
*Impact:* Application crash (PHP process termination); denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developer:*
        *   Implement explicit recursion depth limits *within the PHP code*.
        *   Prefer iterative solutions over recursive ones in *PHP* where possible.
        *   Carefully design base cases for recursive algorithms *in PHP*.
    *   *User/Administrator:*
        *   Increasing PHP's stack size limit is generally *not* recommended as a primary mitigation; it's better to address the root cause in the PHP code.
