# Threat Model Analysis for thealgorithms/php

## Threat: [Algorithmic Complexity Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/algorithmic_complexity_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides carefully crafted input designed to trigger the worst-case time complexity of a PHP-based algorithm implementation within the library. This causes the PHP interpreter to consume excessive CPU time or memory, leading to a denial of service.  The vulnerability lies in the *PHP code* of the algorithm and how the PHP interpreter handles it.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, unable to serve legitimate requests. This can lead to service outages and financial losses. The PHP process may be killed by the operating system if it exceeds resource limits.
*   **Affected PHP Component:** Any algorithm implementation within the library written in PHP that has a significantly worse worst-case time complexity than its average or best-case complexity. Examples include:
    *   `Sort\QuickSort` (PHP implementation, if not carefully designed to mitigate worst-case scenarios with pivot selection)
    *   `Search\LinearSearch` (inherently O(n) in PHP)
    *   `Graph\*` (various graph algorithms implemented in PHP can have high complexity depending on the input graph structure)
    *   `DataStructure\HashTable` (PHP implementation, if collision handling is poor)
    *   Any recursive algorithm implemented in PHP without proper depth limits (leading to stack exhaustion, a PHP-specific limitation).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's reliance on the affected algorithm and the ease of triggering the worst-case scenario *within the PHP environment*).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (PHP Level):**  Within the PHP code, strictly limit the size and complexity of input data passed to the library's PHP functions. Use PHP's type hinting and validation functions.
    *   **Algorithm Selection (PHP Context):** Choose algorithms with guaranteed performance bounds where possible, considering the limitations of PHP's interpreter. Favor iterative solutions over deeply recursive ones in PHP.
    *   **Resource Limits (PHP Configuration):** Implement resource limits (CPU time, memory) using PHP's built-in functions (`set_time_limit()`, `memory_limit`) or through `php.ini` configuration. These are PHP-specific controls.
    *   **Timeouts (PHP-Based):** Implement timeouts for algorithm execution *within the PHP code*. If a PHP function takes longer than a predefined threshold, terminate it using PHP's error handling mechanisms.
    *   **Circuit Breakers (PHP Implementation):** Implement a circuit breaker pattern in PHP to temporarily disable the use of a specific PHP algorithm if it repeatedly causes performance issues.
    *   **Rate Limiting (PHP Logic):** Limit the rate at which users can invoke PHP functions that use potentially vulnerable algorithms, implemented within the PHP application logic.

## Threat: [Data Structure Corruption (Memory Safety - *Specifically within PHP's Interpretation*)](./threats/data_structure_corruption__memory_safety_-_specifically_within_php's_interpretation_.md)

*   **Description:** While PHP is generally memory-safe, a bug *within the PHP implementation* of a data structure (e.g., a heap, tree) could potentially lead to unexpected behavior. This is *less* about traditional memory corruption (like in C) and *more* about logical errors in the PHP code that lead to incorrect data manipulation *within PHP's managed memory space*. This could be due to incorrect indexing, flawed logic in array manipulation, or misuse of PHP's internal data structures.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes (PHP interpreter error), unpredictable behavior, potential for data inconsistencies *within the PHP application's state*. While direct arbitrary code execution is highly unlikely in pure PHP, the corrupted data could be used in unexpected ways by the application.
*   **Affected PHP Component:** Any data structure implementation *written in PHP* within the library, particularly those that involve complex array manipulations or custom object structures. Examples:
    *   `DataStructure\Heap` (PHP implementation)
    *   `DataStructure\Tree\*` (PHP implementation)
    *   `DataStructure\LinkedList` (PHP implementation)
    *   `DataStructure\Graph\*` (PHP implementation)
*   **Risk Severity:** High (because it indicates a fundamental flaw in the PHP code's logic, even if direct memory corruption is unlikely).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review (PHP Focus):** Carefully review the *PHP code* of data structure implementations for potential logical errors, incorrect array indexing, and misuse of PHP's data handling functions.
    *   **Fuzzing (PHP Input):** Use fuzz testing to provide a wide range of unexpected inputs to the *PHP* data structure implementations to identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior *within the PHP interpreter*.
    *   **Property-Based Testing (PHP Logic):** Define properties that should hold true for the data structure (e.g., heap invariants) and use property-based testing *within a PHP testing framework* to verify these properties with a large number of randomly generated inputs.
    *   **Static Analysis (PHP Tools):** Use static analysis tools *specifically designed for PHP* (e.g., Psalm, Phan) to identify potential logical errors and inconsistencies in the PHP code.
    * **Use Built-in Structures (PHP Alternatives):** Where possible, prefer PHP's built-in data structures (arrays, objects) which are generally more robust and managed by the PHP interpreter itself. This reduces the risk of introducing custom logic errors.
