### 4.1. Website Visitor Tracking (with Security Considerations)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Website Visitor Browser"
        A["'Website with Matomo Tracking Code'"]
    end
    subgraph "Matomo Server"
        B["'Web Server (Apache/Nginx)'"] -- "HTTPS Request" --> C["'PHP Application'"];
        C -- "Store Data" --> D["'Database'"];
    end
    A -- "Tracking Request (HTTPS), Potential XSS vector" --> B;
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    linkStyle 0 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px,color:red;
    linkStyle 0 text:"Tracking Request (HTTPS), Potential XSS vector";
    linkStyle 1 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px;
    linkStyle 1 text:"Forward Request, Check for malicious headers";
    linkStyle 2 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px;
    linkStyle 2 text:"Store Tracking Data, Input Validation";
```

**Data Flow and Security Considerations:**

1. A website visitor's browser loads a webpage containing the Matomo tracking code. **Security Consideration:** The tracking code itself could be a vector for XSS if not implemented carefully.
2. The tracking code collects visitor data and sends an HTTPS request to the Matomo server's web server. **Security Consideration:** Ensure HTTPS is enforced to protect data in transit.
3. The web server forwards the request to the PHP application. **Security Consideration:** The web server should be configured to filter malicious requests and headers.
4. The PHP application processes the tracking data and stores it in the database. **Security Consideration:** Robust input validation is crucial to prevent injection attacks.

### 4.2. User Login and Authentication (with Security Considerations)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User Browser"
        E["'User Interface'"]
    end
    subgraph "Matomo Server"
        F["'Web Server (Apache/Nginx)'"] -- "HTTPS Request" --> G["'PHP Application'"];
        G -- "Verify Credentials" --> H["'Database'"];
    end
    E -- "Login Request (HTTPS), Credentials in request" --> F;
    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    linkStyle 0 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px,color:red;
    linkStyle 0 text:"Login Request (HTTPS), Credentials in request";
    linkStyle 1 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px;
    linkStyle 1 text:"Forward Request, Check for suspicious activity";
    linkStyle 2 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px;
    linkStyle 2 text:"Verify Credentials, Prevent brute-force";
```

**Data Flow and Security Considerations:**

1. A user accesses the Matomo login page through their browser.
2. The browser sends a login request (ideally over HTTPS) to the Matomo server's web server, containing user credentials. **Security Consideration:** Ensure HTTPS is used to protect credentials in transit. The login form should be protected against CSRF.
3. The web server forwards the request to the PHP application. **Security Consideration:** Monitor for suspicious login attempts and implement rate limiting.
4. The PHP application retrieves user credentials from the database and authenticates the user. **Security Consideration:** Password hashing and salting must be implemented correctly. Prevent brute-force attacks through mechanisms like account lockout.

### 4.3. User Requesting Reports (with Security Considerations)

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "User Browser"
        I["'User Interface'"]
    end
    subgraph "Matomo Server"
        J["'Web Server (Apache/Nginx)'"] -- "HTTPS Request" --> K["'PHP Application'"];
        K -- "Retrieve Data" --> L["'Database'"];
    end
    I -- "Report Request (HTTPS), Potential for parameter tampering" --> J;
    style I fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style J fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style K fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style L fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    linkStyle 0 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px,color:red;
    linkStyle 0 text:"Report Request (HTTPS), Potential for parameter tampering";
    linkStyle 1 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px;
    linkStyle 1 text:"Forward Request, Authorization checks";
    linkStyle 2 stroke:black,stroke-width:2px;
    linkStyle 2 text:"Retrieve Data, Ensure data access controls";
```

**Data Flow and Security Considerations:**

1. A user requests a report through the Matomo user interface.
2. The browser sends a report request to the Matomo server's web server. **Security Consideration:** Report requests might contain parameters that could be tampered with to access unauthorized data.
3. The web server forwards the request to the PHP application. **Security Consideration:** Ensure proper authorization checks are performed to verify the user has permission to access the requested data.
4. The PHP application queries the database for the necessary data, processes it, and generates the report. **Security Consideration:** Database queries should be constructed securely to prevent SQL injection based on report parameters. Ensure data access controls are enforced at the database level.
