# Attack Surface Analysis for matomo-org/matomo

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* **Description:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
* **How Matomo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Matomo's interface involves displaying user-provided data (e.g., website names, custom variable names, goal names) and data collected from tracked websites. If this data is not properly sanitized before being rendered, it can be a vector for XSS.
* **Example:** An attacker injects a `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` payload into a website name within Matomo. When an administrator views the website details, the script executes in their browser.
* **Impact:** Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Matomo interface, or even administrative account compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers: Implement robust input validation and output encoding (escaping) across the application, especially for user-controlled data displayed in reports or used in dynamic content generation. Utilize context-aware escaping techniques.
    * Users: Ensure Matomo is updated to the latest version as security patches often address XSS vulnerabilities. Be cautious when installing third-party plugins, as they can also introduce XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

* **Description:** Enables attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the Matomo application.
* **How Matomo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Matomo has various administrative actions (e.g., creating users, changing permissions, updating settings) that, if not properly protected against CSRF, can be triggered by malicious websites or emails.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link or embeds a form on a website that, when visited by an authenticated Matomo administrator, sends a request to Matomo to create a new administrative user with attacker-controlled credentials.
* **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized modifications of Matomo configuration, data manipulation, account compromise, and potentially full control over the Matomo instance.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers: Implement anti-CSRF tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern) for all state-changing requests. Ensure proper validation of these tokens on the server-side. Utilize the framework's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms.
    * Users: Keep your web browser updated with the latest security patches. Be cautious about clicking on suspicious links or opening attachments from untrusted sources while logged into Matomo.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

* **Description:** Allows attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
* **How Matomo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Matomo relies on a database to store tracking data, user information, and configuration settings. If user-provided input is not properly sanitized and parameterized before being used in SQL queries, it can create SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input in a search field or a custom report parameter that, when processed by Matomo, injects additional SQL commands to extract sensitive data from the database.
* **Impact:** Can lead to complete database compromise, exposing sensitive tracking data, user credentials, and configuration information. Attackers could potentially gain full control over the Matomo server.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers: Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. Avoid constructing SQL queries by concatenating user input directly. Employ an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides built-in protection against SQL injection. Implement strict input validation to ensure data conforms to expected types and formats.
    * Users: Keep Matomo updated to benefit from security patches. Ensure the database server itself is properly secured.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Issues](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_issues.md)

* **Description:** Weaknesses in how Matomo's API authenticates users or authorizes access to specific API endpoints and data.
* **How Matomo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Matomo provides an API for programmatic access to its data and functionality. If authentication is weak or authorization checks are insufficient, attackers could gain unauthorized access.
* **Example:** An API endpoint intended for retrieving aggregated data lacks proper authentication, allowing anyone to access sensitive analytics information. Another example is an API endpoint allowing modification of user roles without proper authorization checks.
* **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized data retrieval, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the analytics data. It could also allow attackers to manipulate user accounts or settings.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers: Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0). Enforce granular authorization checks to ensure users can only access the resources they are permitted to. Avoid relying solely on client-side validation for authorization. Regularly review and audit API access controls.
    * Users: Securely store and manage API keys. Be cautious about sharing API keys and limit their scope to the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads.md)

* **Description:**  Allows attackers to upload malicious files to the Matomo server.
* **How Matomo Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Features that allow users to upload files (e.g., custom logos, report attachments, potentially through plugins) can be exploited if not properly secured.
* **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the server allows execution of this script, the attacker can gain remote code execution.
* **Impact:** Can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain full control over the Matomo server, potentially compromising the entire system and any data it holds.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers: Implement strict file type validation on the server-side (do not rely on client-side validation). Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks. Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible. Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory. Implement anti-virus scanning on uploaded files.
    * Users: Be cautious about uploading files, even if prompted by the application.
