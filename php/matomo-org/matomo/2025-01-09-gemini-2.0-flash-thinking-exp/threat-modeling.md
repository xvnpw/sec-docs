# Threat Model Analysis for matomo-org/matomo

## Threat: [Malicious JavaScript Injection via Matomo Tracking Code](./threats/malicious_javascript_injection_via_matomo_tracking_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the Matomo server or its configuration to inject malicious JavaScript code into the tracking snippet served to the application's users. When users load pages, this malicious script executes in their browsers.

**Impact:** Stealing user credentials or sensitive data, redirecting users to phishing sites, performing actions on behalf of the user, injecting advertisements or malware, defacing the application.

**Which https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo component is affected:**  Tracking Code Generation/Delivery mechanism, potentially the JavaScript Tracker file itself or the mechanism serving it.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong security measures for the Matomo server, including access controls and regular security updates.
*   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
*   Regularly audit the integrity of the Matomo JavaScript tracker file.
*   Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) for the Matomo JavaScript file.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Matomo Reports](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_matomo_reports.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is later displayed in Matomo reports (e.g., custom segment names, goal names, website names). When other users view these reports, the malicious script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Stealing administrator session cookies, performing actions on behalf of administrators within Matomo, redirecting administrators to malicious sites, potentially gaining control of the Matomo instance.

**Which https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo component is affected:** Reporting Interface (likely within the presentation layer rendering report data).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and output encoding/escaping for all user-provided data displayed in Matomo reports.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the Matomo administrative interface.
*   Regularly update Matomo to the latest version, which includes security patches.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Tracking Code Manipulation](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_tracking_code_manipulation.md)

*   Adopt an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to abstract database interactions and reduce the risk of manual SQL construction.
*   Regularly scan Matomo for SQL injection vulnerabilities using automated tools.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability in Matomo](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability_in_matomo.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Matomo's PHP code or its dependencies to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Matomo. This could involve exploiting insecure deserialization, file upload vulnerabilities, or other code execution flaws.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Matomo server, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, and further attacks on other systems.

**Which https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo component is affected:** Various PHP modules and potentially third-party libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Matomo and its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
*   Harden the Matomo server by disabling unnecessary PHP functions and services.
*   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests.
*   Regularly scan Matomo for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in Matomo](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_matomo.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Matomo's authentication mechanisms (e.g., weak password policies, insecure session management) to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access to the Matomo administrative interface.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive analytics data, modification of Matomo settings, potential for further attacks.

**Which https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo component is affected:** User Management Module, Authentication System.

*   Regularly review user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Matomo](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_matomo.md)

**Description:** If Matomo uses PHP object serialization and deserialization insecurely, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized by the application, lead to code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Matomo server.

**Which https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo component is affected:** Potentially various modules that handle data persistence or inter-process communication using serialization.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using PHP's `unserialize()` function with untrusted data.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use safer alternatives or implement robust input validation and sanitization on the serialized data.
*   Keep Matomo and its dependencies updated, as security patches often address deserialization vulnerabilities.
