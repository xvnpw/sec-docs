Matomo is typically deployed as a self-hosted PHP web application on infrastructure managed by the user. This self-hosting model provides greater control over data and infrastructure compared to SaaS offerings.

## 3. System Architecture

The Matomo platform is structured into distinct layers and components that interact to provide its core functionalities.

* **Presentation Layer:**  Handles user interaction and data presentation.
    * "Web User Interface (UI)":  A browser-based interface built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to view reports, configure settings, and manage the platform.
    * "Public HTTP API":  A RESTful API enabling external applications and scripts to programmatically access analytics data and manage Matomo configurations.

* **Application Layer:** Contains the core business logic and processing capabilities.
    * "Core Matomo Application": The central PHP codebase responsible for request handling, data processing orchestration, security enforcement, and overall system management.
    * "Tracking Logic":  Processes incoming tracking requests, validates data, and prepares it for storage.
    * "Reporting Engine":  Aggregates raw tracking data, calculates metrics, and generates reports based on user queries or scheduled tasks.
    * "User Management":  Handles user authentication, authorization, role management, and permission control.
    * "Plugin Management":  Manages the installation, activation, deactivation, and execution of plugins, extending the core functionality.
    * "Configuration Management":  Stores and manages system-wide settings, website configurations, user preferences, and plugin configurations.

* **Data Storage Layer:**  Responsible for persistent data storage.
    * "Database":  A relational database (typically MySQL or MariaDB) storing raw tracking data (visits, page views, events), aggregated report data, user accounts, website configurations, and plugin settings.
    * "File System":  Used for storing uploaded files (e.g., GeoIP databases), temporary files, plugin files, and potentially cached data.

* **Data Collection Layer:**  Handles the intake of tracking data.
    * "JavaScript Tracker":  A JavaScript snippet embedded in websites to collect client-side data (e.g., page views, screen size, browser information) and send it to the Matomo server.
    * "Tracking HTTP API":  An HTTP endpoint (`/matomo.php`) that receives tracking requests from the JavaScript tracker, server-side tracking libraries, and other sources.
    * "Import Scripts":  Command-line scripts (often PHP-based) for importing historical data from other analytics platforms, server logs, or other data sources.

## 4. Data Flow

The process of data collection, processing, and presentation in Matomo follows these steps:

1. **Tracking Event:** A user interacts with a tracked website (e.g., loads a page, clicks a button), or a server-side tracking call is initiated.
2. **Data Transmission:** The "JavaScript Tracker" on the website or a server-side tracking library sends an HTTP request containing tracking parameters to the "Tracking HTTP API" endpoint on the Matomo server. This request typically includes information like the page URL, user agent, and custom event data.
3. **Request Reception:** The "Tracking HTTP API" receives the incoming request.
4. **Data Processing and Validation:** The "Tracking Logic" component processes the request, validating the data format and parameters. This step may involve sanitizing input to prevent injection attacks.
5. **Raw Data Storage:** The validated raw tracking data is stored in the "Database". This includes individual visit and action records.
6. **Scheduled Processing:**  The "Reporting Engine" is periodically triggered (e.g., by cron jobs) to process the raw data.
7. **Data Aggregation:** The "Reporting Engine" aggregates the raw data based on various dimensions (e.g., date, country, page URL) to calculate key metrics.
8. **Report Data Storage:** The aggregated report data is stored in the "Database", often in separate tables optimized for querying.
9. **User Request:** A user accesses the "Web UI" or an external application makes a request to the "Public HTTP API" for analytics data.
10. **Data Retrieval:** The "Core Matomo Application" receives the request and queries the "Database" for the relevant report data.
11. **Data Presentation:** The "Web UI" renders the retrieved data into charts, tables, and dashboards for the user. The "Public HTTP API" returns the data in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Tracked Website"
        N("User Interaction")
    end
    O("JavaScript Tracker")
    P("Tracking HTTP API")
    Q("Tracking Logic")

    subgraph "User"
        U("Web UI User")
        V("API User")
    end
    W("Web UI")
    X("Public HTTP API")

## 5. Key Components in Detail

* **"JavaScript Tracker"**: This client-side script is responsible for collecting data directly from the user's browser.
    * **Security Considerations:**  Vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the tracked website is compromised. Care must be taken to ensure the tracker script itself is served securely and that any data it collects and transmits is handled securely by the Matomo server. Improper configuration on the tracked website could also lead to data leakage.

* **"Tracking HTTP API"**: The primary entry point for receiving tracking data.
    * **Security Considerations:**  A critical component that needs to be highly secure to prevent unauthorized data injection, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and other forms of abuse. Proper input validation and rate limiting are essential. Vulnerabilities here could lead to data corruption or the ability to track arbitrary data.

* **"Core Matomo Application"**: The central hub of the platform, managing authentication, authorization, and core functionalities.
    * **Security Considerations:**  Susceptible to common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and authentication/authorization bypasses. Secure coding practices and regular security audits are crucial.

* **"Database"**: Stores all critical data, including raw tracking data, aggregated reports, and user credentials.
    * **Security Considerations:**  Requires robust security measures to protect sensitive data. This includes strong access controls, encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit, and protection against SQL Injection attacks originating from the "Core Matomo Application" or plugins.

* **"Web UI"**: The user interface for accessing and managing Matomo.
    * **Security Considerations:**  A potential target for XSS attacks, CSRF attacks, and session hijacking. Proper output encoding, anti-CSRF tokens, and secure session management are necessary.

* **"Plugin Management"**:  While providing extensibility, plugins can introduce security risks.
    * **Security Considerations:**  Plugins, being third-party code, can contain vulnerabilities or malicious code. A robust plugin security model, including input validation within plugins and potentially sandboxing, is important. Regular security reviews of popular plugins are also beneficial.
