## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Store Matomo Database Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/securely_store_matomo_database_credentials.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Store Matomo Database Credentials
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Hardcoding Matomo Database Credentials:** Do not hardcode Matomo database credentials directly in Matomo configuration files (e.g., `config.ini.php`) or application code interacting with the Matomo database.
    2.  **Use Environment Variables for Matomo Database Credentials:** Store Matomo database credentials as environment variables. Matomo can be configured to read database connection details from environment variables.
    3.  **Implement Access Control for Matomo Credentials Storage:** Restrict access to the environment where Matomo database credentials are stored (e.g., server environment variables, secrets management systems) to only authorized personnel and processes that need to access the Matomo database.
    4.  **Use Secrets Management Solutions for Matomo Credentials (Recommended):** For more robust security, utilize dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage Matomo database credentials securely. These solutions provide features like encryption, access control, and audit logging for Matomo credentials.
    5.  **Rotate Matomo Database Credentials Regularly:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating Matomo database credentials to limit the impact of compromised Matomo credentials.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure of Matomo Database Credentials (High Severity):**  Insecure storage of Matomo database credentials can lead to their disclosure, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the Matomo database.
    *   **Matomo Database Compromise (High Severity):**  Compromised Matomo database credentials can be used to access, modify, or delete sensitive data in the Matomo database, leading to data breaches and compromise of Matomo analytics data.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** in risk of Matomo database credential compromise and subsequent Matomo database breaches. Secure credential storage is critical for protecting the Matomo database.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Potentially partially implemented. Environment variables might be used for Matomo database credentials, but dedicated secrets management solutions and regular credential rotation for Matomo database access might be missing. Location: Server environment configuration, deployment scripts, potentially secrets management system.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Migration to a dedicated secrets management solution for Matomo database credentials, implementation of regular Matomo database credential rotation, documented credential management procedures for Matomo database access, and access control policies for Matomo credential storage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Backup Matomo Data and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_backup_matomo_data_and_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Backup Matomo Data and Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Matomo Backup Frequency and Retention:** Determine appropriate backup frequency (e.g., daily, weekly) and retention periods based on recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) for Matomo data and configuration.
    2.  **Backup Both Matomo Database and Configuration:** Backup both the Matomo database (containing analytics data) and the Matomo configuration files (`config.ini.php`, etc.).
    3.  **Automate Matomo Backup Process:** Automate the Matomo backup process using scripting or backup tools to ensure regular and consistent backups of Matomo data and configuration.
    4.  **Store Matomo Backups Securely and Offsite:** Store Matomo backups in a secure location that is separate from the live Matomo environment. Ideally, store Matomo backups offsite or in a geographically separate location to protect against physical disasters affecting the Matomo server. Encrypt Matomo backups at rest and in transit.
    5.  **Test Matomo Backup Restoration Regularly:** Periodically test the Matomo backup restoration process to ensure that Matomo backups are valid and can be successfully restored in a timely manner.
    6.  **Monitor Matomo Backup Process:** Monitor the Matomo backup process to ensure that backups are running successfully and that any errors or failures are promptly addressed in the Matomo backup system.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss of Matomo Analytics Data due to Security Incidents (High Severity):**  Matomo backups are essential for recovering Matomo data in case of security incidents like ransomware attacks, data breaches, or system compromise affecting the Matomo application.
    *   **Data Loss of Matomo Analytics Data due to System Failures (High Severity):**  Matomo backups protect against data loss due to hardware failures, software errors, or other system malfunctions affecting the Matomo server.
