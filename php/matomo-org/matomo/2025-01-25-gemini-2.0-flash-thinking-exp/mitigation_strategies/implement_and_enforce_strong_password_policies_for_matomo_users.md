    *   **Increased Password Reset Requests:**  Users may forget frequently changed passwords, increasing support burden.
    *   **Limited Effectiveness Against Modern Threats:**  Password rotation alone is less effective against phishing or sophisticated attacks. Modern best practices often favor strong, unique passwords and MFA over mandatory rotation.
    *   **Implementation Challenges (Matomo Specific):** Matomo might not have built-in automated password rotation enforcement or reminders.
*   **Implementation Details (Matomo Specific):**
    *   **Check Matomo Features:**  Investigate if Matomo has any built-in features for password rotation or reminders.
    *   **Plugin Research:**  Look for Matomo plugins that provide password rotation functionality.
    *   **Manual Reminders and Policy Communication:**  If automated enforcement is not feasible, implement a manual process of sending email reminders to users to change their passwords periodically. Clearly communicate the password rotation policy.
*   **User Impact:**  Generally negative due to inconvenience. Requires careful communication and justification.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Re-evaluate Necessity:**  Consider if mandatory password rotation is truly necessary given modern security best practices. For many applications, focusing on strong, unique passwords and MFA is more effective.
    *   **If Implemented, Choose Reasonable Frequency:**  If rotation is deemed necessary, a longer period like 90-180 days is generally preferred over shorter intervals to minimize user fatigue.
    *   **Automated Reminders:**  Implement automated email reminders to users when their password rotation is due.
    *   **Focus on Strong Passwords and MFA First:** Prioritize strong password enforcement and MFA implementation before relying heavily on password rotation as a primary security control.

#### 4.4. Discourage Password Reuse

*   **Description:**  Educating Matomo users about the significant risks of reusing passwords across multiple online accounts, including their Matomo account. Encourage them to use unique, strong passwords for each service.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Mitigates Credential Stuffing Attacks (High):**  Significantly reduces the risk of credential stuffing attacks. If a user's password is compromised on a less secure site, it won't grant access to their Matomo account if they use a unique password.
    *   **Broad Security Improvement:**  Promotes better overall password hygiene among users, benefiting their security across all online accounts.
    *   **Low Implementation Cost:**  Primarily involves user education and communication.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **User Behavior Challenge:**  Changing user behavior is difficult. Users may still reuse passwords despite education.
    *   **No Technical Enforcement (Directly):**  This is primarily a policy and education measure, not directly enforced by Matomo technically (unless combined with password breach detection, which is more advanced).
*   **Implementation Details (Matomo Specific):**
    *   **User Training Materials:**  Create documentation, FAQs, or short training videos explaining the risks of password reuse and the importance of unique passwords.
    *   **Login Page Reminders:**  Consider adding a brief reminder about password reuse risks on the Matomo login page.
    *   **Onboarding Process:**  Incorporate password security best practices into the user onboarding process.

    *   **Provide Practical Advice:**  Recommend using password managers to generate and store unique, strong passwords for different accounts.
    *   **Regular Reinforcement:**  Periodically remind users about password security best practices through newsletters or announcements.

#### 4.5. Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

*   **Description:**  Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Matomo user logins, especially for administrator accounts or highly sensitive Matomo installations. MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords by requiring users to provide a second verification factor (e.g., a code from a mobile app, SMS, or hardware token).
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Significantly Mitigates Brute-Force, Credential Stuffing, and Phishing Attacks (High):**  Even if an attacker compromises a user's password, they will still need the second factor to gain access, making account takeover much more difficult.
    *   **Enhanced Security for Sensitive Data:**  Provides a strong layer of protection for critical Matomo data and administrator access.
    *   **Industry Best Practice:**  MFA is a widely recognized and highly effective security control for protecting online accounts.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Implementation Complexity (Potentially Higher):**  Matomo might not have built-in MFA. Plugins or custom integration with an MFA provider might be required.
    *   **User Convenience Impact:**  MFA adds an extra step to the login process, which can be perceived as slightly less convenient by users.
    *   **Cost (Potentially):**  Some MFA solutions or plugins might have associated costs.
*   **Implementation Details (Matomo Specific):**
    *   **Matomo Plugin Research:**  Thoroughly investigate available Matomo plugins that offer MFA functionality. Search the Matomo Marketplace or community forums.
    *   **Plugin Compatibility and Security:**  Carefully evaluate the security and reliability of any MFA plugins before implementation.
    *   **MFA Method Selection:**  Choose appropriate MFA methods based on security needs and user accessibility (e.g., TOTP apps, WebAuthn, SMS as a fallback).
    *   **Rollout Strategy:**  Consider a phased rollout of MFA, starting with administrator accounts and then expanding to other users based on sensitivity.
*   **User Impact:**  Slightly negative impact on login convenience, but significantly enhances security. Clear communication and user training are essential.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Prioritize MFA for Administrator Accounts:**  Implement MFA for all Matomo administrator accounts as a top priority.
    *   **Evaluate MFA Plugins:**  Research and test available Matomo MFA plugins for compatibility, security, and ease of use.
    *   **User Education and Support:**  Provide clear instructions and support to users on how to set up and use MFA. Explain the security benefits.
    *   **Consider WebAuthn:**  If supported by Matomo plugins, WebAuthn (using platform authenticators like fingerprint or face recognition) offers a more user-friendly and secure MFA option than traditional TOTP apps.

### 5. Overall Impact and Currently Implemented/Missing Implementation

*   **Overall Impact:** **High Reduction** in risk for password-related attacks targeting Matomo user accounts when all components are effectively implemented. Strong password policies and MFA, when combined, create a robust defense against common password-based threats.
*   **Currently Implemented (Assessment):**  Likely partially implemented. The password strength meter might be enabled by default or easily activated. However, formal password complexity requirements, enforced rotation policies, and MFA are probably missing or not consistently enforced. User education on password reuse is also likely lacking.
*   **Missing Implementation (Summary):**
    *   **Formal Documented Password Policy:**  Lack of a clearly defined and documented password policy for Matomo users.
    *   **Enforced Password Complexity Requirements:**  Absence of strict enforcement of password complexity beyond the strength meter.
    *   **Automated Password Rotation Enforcement/Reminders:**  No automated system for enforcing password rotation or reminding users to change passwords.
    *   **MFA Implementation (Especially for Admins):**  MFA is likely not implemented, particularly for administrator accounts.
    *   **Formal User Education on Password Security:**  Lack of structured user training or communication regarding password security best practices, especially password reuse.

### 6. Recommendations and Conclusion
