## Deep Analysis: User-Provided Data in Settings & Reports (Injection & File Upload) - Matomo

This document provides a deep analysis of the "User-Provided Data in Settings & Reports (Injection & File Upload)" attack surface in Matomo, as identified in our initial attack surface analysis. It outlines the objective, scope, methodology, and a detailed breakdown of potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the attack surface related to user-provided data within Matomo's settings and reporting functionalities.  This includes identifying potential vulnerabilities stemming from insufficient input validation, sanitization, and output encoding, specifically focusing on injection attacks (XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection) and malicious file uploads.  The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to strengthen Matomo's security posture in these areas and mitigate identified risks.

### 2. Scope

This analysis will focus on the following areas within Matomo:

*   **Administrative Interface:** All sections of the Matomo administrative interface where users with appropriate permissions can input data related to settings and reports. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   **System Settings:**  General settings, website settings, user settings, privacy settings, email settings, etc.
    *   **Report Customization:** Custom reports, dashboard configurations, widget settings, report names, descriptions, and any features allowing user-defined content within reports.
    *   **Plugin Management:** Plugin upload and configuration interfaces.
    *   **GeoIP Database Updates:** Functionality related to uploading or configuring GeoIP databases.
    *   **Theme Management:** Theme upload and configuration interfaces (if applicable and user-configurable).
    *   **User and Role Management:** User creation, role assignment, and permission settings (indirectly related as permissions control access to vulnerable features).
*   **Input Handling Mechanisms:**  Matomo's codebase responsible for processing user input from the identified areas, including:
    *   Form handling logic.
    *   API endpoints accepting user data for settings and reports.
    *   File upload processing routines.
    *   Database interaction logic related to storing and retrieving settings and report configurations.
*   **Output Rendering:**  Matomo's codebase responsible for displaying user-provided data in the administrative interface and reports, focusing on output encoding and potential XSS vulnerabilities.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Analysis of Matomo's tracking code and data collection mechanisms (unless directly related to settings that influence tracking behavior and introduce injection risks).
*   Third-party plugins (unless explicitly used as examples to illustrate potential vulnerabilities in Matomo's plugin architecture related to user-provided data).
*   Infrastructure security (server configuration, network security) beyond the Matomo application itself.

### 3. Methodology

To conduct this deep analysis, we will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   **Manual Code Review:** We will examine Matomo's source code, specifically focusing on the modules and functions responsible for handling user input in settings and reports. We will look for:
        *   Input points (form submissions, API requests, file uploads).
        *   Input validation and sanitization routines (or lack thereof).
        *   Output encoding mechanisms.
        *   Database query construction (to identify potential SQL injection points).
        *   File upload handling procedures.
    *   **Automated Static Analysis Tools:** We will utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan Matomo's codebase for potential vulnerabilities related to injection and insecure file handling. This will help identify potential issues that might be missed during manual review.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Simulated Penetration Testing):**
    *   **Input Fuzzing:** We will systematically test input fields in settings and report configuration forms with various payloads designed to trigger injection vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection).
    *   **File Upload Testing:** We will attempt to upload various file types, including potentially malicious files (e.g., PHP shells disguised as images or other allowed file types), to test file upload validation and handling mechanisms.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization Testing:** We will verify that access controls are properly implemented to prevent unauthorized users from modifying sensitive settings or uploading files.
*   **Configuration Review:**
    *   We will review Matomo's configuration files and database settings related to security, user permissions, and file upload configurations to identify any misconfigurations that could exacerbate vulnerabilities.
    *   We will analyze Matomo's documentation and security guidelines to understand recommended security practices and identify any deviations in the codebase.
*   **Threat Modeling:**
    *   Based on the code review and dynamic analysis, we will develop threat models specific to the identified attack surface. This will help visualize potential attack paths and prioritize mitigation efforts.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: User-Provided Data in Settings & Reports

This section details the deep analysis of the identified attack surface, broken down by vulnerability type and specific areas within Matomo.

#### 4.1 Injection Vulnerabilities

**4.1.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Potential Locations:**
    *   **Report Names and Descriptions:** User-defined names and descriptions for custom reports, dashboards, and widgets. If these are not properly encoded when displayed to other users, malicious JavaScript could be injected.
    *   **Customizable Report Content (if any):**  If Matomo allows users to embed custom HTML or JavaScript within reports (e.g., through specific widgets or features), this could be a direct XSS vector.
    *   **Settings Fields:** Certain settings fields that are displayed back to administrators or other users in the interface (e.g., website names, custom messages).
    *   **Plugin Configuration:**  Configuration options for plugins that might be displayed in the admin interface.
*   **Exploitation Scenario (Example: Reflected XSS in Report Name):**
    1.  An administrator with report creation privileges crafts a malicious report name containing JavaScript code, e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>My Report`.
    2.  This report name is saved in the Matomo database without proper output encoding.
    3.  When another user (or even the same administrator) views the list of reports or the report itself, the malicious JavaScript in the report name is rendered by the browser.
    4.  The JavaScript executes in the user's browser session, potentially allowing the attacker to:
        *   Steal session cookies and hijack user accounts.
        *   Deface the Matomo interface.
        *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the user within Matomo.
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Specific to Matomo):**
    *   **Output Encoding Everywhere:** Implement robust output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) for *all* user-provided data displayed in the Matomo interface, especially in report names, descriptions, settings values, and any dynamically generated content.  Utilize Matomo's templating engine's built-in encoding functions consistently.
    *   **Context-Aware Encoding:**  Apply encoding appropriate to the context. For HTML output, use HTML entity encoding. For JavaScript contexts, use JavaScript encoding.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and enforce a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources (scripts, styles, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks even if they occur. Matomo should provide CSP configuration options.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and penetration testing specifically focused on XSS vulnerabilities in user-facing parts of the Matomo interface.

**4.1.2 SQL Injection**

*   **Potential Locations:**
    *   **Database Queries in Settings and Report Logic:** If user-provided data is directly incorporated into SQL queries used to retrieve or manipulate settings or report data without proper parameterization or input validation, SQL injection vulnerabilities could arise.
    *   **Custom Report Filters (if any):** If Matomo allows users to define custom filters for reports using SQL-like syntax or by directly constructing SQL queries, this is a high-risk area.
    *   **Plugin Interactions with Database:** Plugins that interact with the Matomo database and rely on user-provided data in settings or configurations could introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
*   **Exploitation Scenario (Example: SQL Injection in Report Filtering - Hypothetical):**
    1.  Assume Matomo has a feature (hypothetical for illustration) where administrators can define custom report filters using a text input field that is directly incorporated into a SQL query.
    2.  An attacker crafts a malicious filter input designed to inject SQL code, e.g., `' OR 1=1 --`.
    3.  If Matomo's code directly concatenates this input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, the resulting query could be manipulated to bypass intended filtering logic or even execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    4.  This could allow the attacker to:
        *   Bypass authentication and authorization checks.
        *   Extract sensitive data from the Matomo database (user credentials, tracking data, settings).
        *   Modify or delete data in the database.
        *   In some cases, potentially gain command execution on the database server (depending on database server configuration and permissions).
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Specific to Matomo):**
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Mandatory use of parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions involving user-provided data. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. Matomo's database abstraction layer should enforce this practice.
    *   **Input Validation (Data Type and Format):** Validate user input to ensure it conforms to the expected data type and format before using it in database queries. For example, if an integer is expected, verify that the input is indeed an integer.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Access):**  Ensure that the database user Matomo uses has only the necessary permissions to perform its functions. Avoid granting excessive privileges that could be exploited in case of SQL injection.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (SQL Injection Focus):**  Specifically audit database interaction code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, especially in areas handling user-provided settings and report configurations.

**4.1.3 Command Injection (Less Likely, but Consider)**

*   **Potential Locations:**
    *   **Settings that Execute System Commands:**  If Matomo settings allow administrators to configure paths to external tools or execute system commands based on user input (e.g., for certain advanced features or integrations), command injection vulnerabilities could be present. This is less common in web applications like Matomo but should be considered.
    *   **File Processing Logic:**  In rare cases, vulnerabilities in file processing logic (e.g., image processing, file conversion) could be exploited to achieve command injection if user-provided data influences command execution.
*   **Exploitation Scenario (Example: Hypothetical Command Injection in External Tool Path):**
    1.  Assume Matomo has a setting where administrators can specify the path to an external image processing tool.
    2.  An attacker modifies this setting to include a malicious command within the path, e.g., `/usr/bin/convert '; id > /tmp/output.txt ;'`.
    3.  If Matomo's code executes this path without proper sanitization when invoking the external tool, the injected command (`id > /tmp/output.txt`) will be executed on the server.
    4.  This could allow the attacker to:
        *   Execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the Matomo web server process.
        *   Potentially gain full control of the server.
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Specific to Matomo):**
    *   **Avoid System Command Execution with User Input:**  Minimize or eliminate the need to execute system commands based on user-provided data. If absolutely necessary, carefully sanitize and validate user input before incorporating it into commands.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (Command Context):** If system commands are executed, rigorously sanitize and validate user input to remove or escape any characters that could be used for command injection. Use whitelisting and escape shell metacharacters.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (System User):**  Run the Matomo web server process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (Command Injection Focus):**  Specifically audit code that executes system commands for potential command injection vulnerabilities.

#### 4.2 Malicious File Upload Vulnerabilities

*   **Potential Locations:**
    *   **Plugin Upload:**  Functionality to upload and install plugins.
    *   **Theme Upload (if applicable):** Functionality to upload and install themes.
    *   **GeoIP Database Updates:**  Functionality to upload or update GeoIP database files.
    *   **Custom Report Templates (if any):** If Matomo allows uploading custom report templates, this could be a file upload vector.
    *   **Avatar/Profile Picture Uploads (if applicable):** User profile picture upload functionality.
*   **Exploitation Scenario (Example: PHP Shell Upload via Plugin Upload):**
    1.  An attacker with administrative privileges crafts a malicious plugin archive (e.g., ZIP file) containing a PHP shell script disguised as a legitimate plugin file.
    2.  The attacker uploads this malicious plugin archive through Matomo's plugin upload interface.
    3.  If Matomo's file upload validation is insufficient (e.g., only checks file extension and not content), the malicious archive is uploaded and extracted to the Matomo plugins directory.
    4.  The attacker can then access the uploaded PHP shell script directly through the web server (if the plugins directory is accessible via the web) and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially gaining remote code execution.
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Specific to Matomo):**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation (Server-Side):** Implement robust server-side file type validation.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed File Extensions:** Only allow explicitly permitted file extensions (e.g., `.zip` for plugins, `.dat` for GeoIP databases).
        *   **Magic Number/File Signature Verification:** Verify the file's magic number (file signature) to ensure it matches the expected file type, regardless of the file extension.
        *   **MIME Type Checking (with Caution):**  MIME type checking can be used as an additional layer, but it's less reliable than magic number verification as MIME types can be easily spoofed.
    *   **File Content Scanning (Virus Scanning):** Integrate with a virus scanning engine (e.g., ClamAV) to scan uploaded files for malware before they are stored or processed. This adds a significant layer of security.
    *   **Secure File Storage:**
        *   **Store Uploaded Files Outside Web Root:** Store uploaded files (especially plugin and theme files) outside the web server's document root to prevent direct access via the web.
        *   **Randomized Filenames:** Rename uploaded files to randomly generated filenames to prevent predictable filenames and directory traversal attacks.
        *   **Restrict File Permissions:** Set restrictive file permissions on uploaded files and directories to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
    *   **File Size Limits:** Implement file size limits for uploads to prevent denial-of-service attacks and limit the potential damage from malicious uploads. Configurable within Matomo settings.
    *   **Extraction and Processing Security:** When extracting archives (e.g., plugin ZIP files), ensure secure extraction practices to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities during extraction. Carefully review and sanitize any code that processes uploaded files.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (User Permissions):** Restrict plugin and theme upload functionality to only highly trusted administrators. Implement granular user roles and permissions within Matomo.
