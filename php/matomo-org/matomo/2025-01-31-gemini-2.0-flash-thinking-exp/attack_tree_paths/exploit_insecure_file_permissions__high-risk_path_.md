### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Insecure File Permissions

**Attack Vector:** Configuration Weaknesses - Exploiting misconfigured file permissions to gain access to sensitive files.

**Critical Nodes:**

#### 4.1. Identify Misconfigured File Permissions on Matomo Files/Directories [CRITICAL NODE]

**Breakdown:**

*   **4.1.1. Scanning File System for Permission Issues:**
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Manual Inspection (using command-line tools):** Attackers can use commands like `ls -l` (Linux/Unix) or `Get-Acl` (Windows PowerShell) to list file and directory permissions within the Matomo installation directory. They would look for overly permissive settings, especially for world-readable or world-writable files and directories.
        *   **Automated Scripting:** Attackers can write scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Python scripts) to automate the scanning process, recursively checking permissions across the entire Matomo file structure. These scripts can flag files and directories that deviate from secure permission baselines.
        *   **Security Scanning Tools:**  Vulnerability scanners (both general web application scanners and specialized file system scanners) can be used to identify misconfigured file permissions. These tools often have built-in checks for common permission vulnerabilities.
    *   **Target Areas within Matomo:**
        *   **Configuration Directory (`config/`):** This directory is a prime target as it contains sensitive configuration files like `config.ini.php` which holds database credentials, salts, and other critical settings.
        *   **`tmp/` directory:**  While often used for temporary files, misconfigurations here could expose sensitive data or allow for file injection if permissions are overly permissive.
        *   **`plugins/` and `themes/` directories:**  If writable by the web server user, these directories could be exploited for uploading malicious code.
        *   **Log files directory (`logs/`):**  While logs themselves might not be directly exploitable for system compromise, they can contain sensitive information about users, system activity, and potential vulnerabilities, aiding in further attacks.
        *   **Web server document root:**  If the Matomo installation directory is directly within the web server's document root and permissions are misconfigured, it increases the attack surface.

*   **4.1.2. Common Misconfigurations:**
    *   **World-Readable Files (Permissions like `644` or `755` for sensitive files):**  Configuration files, especially `config.ini.php`, should *never* be world-readable. They should ideally be readable only by the web server user and the user managing the Matomo installation.
    *   **World-Writable Directories (Permissions like `777`):**  Directories should generally not be world-writable.  This is a significant security risk as it allows any user on the system (or potentially remote attackers if combined with other vulnerabilities) to modify or delete files within the directory.
    *   **Group-Readable/Writable Files/Directories:**  While less severe than world-writable, overly permissive group permissions can still be a risk if the web server user belongs to a group with other potentially compromised users or processes.
    *   **Incorrect Ownership:**  Files and directories should be owned by the appropriate user and group (typically the web server user and group). Incorrect ownership can lead to permission issues and prevent the web server from functioning correctly or securely.
    *   **Setuid/Setgid Bits Misuse:**  While less common in typical web application deployments, misuse of setuid/setgid bits on executables within the Matomo installation could lead to privilege escalation if exploited.

**Analysis of Critical Node 4.1:**

Identifying misconfigured file permissions is the crucial first step for an attacker exploiting this path.  The ease of identifying these misconfigurations depends on the attacker's access level. A local attacker with shell access can easily scan the file system. A remote attacker might need to rely on other vulnerabilities (e.g., directory traversal, information disclosure) to gain enough information about the file structure and permissions to identify weaknesses.  Automated tools and scripts significantly simplify this identification process for attackers.

**Mitigation for Critical Node 4.1:**

*   **Regular Permission Audits:** Implement regular automated or manual audits of file and directory permissions within the Matomo installation.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege when setting permissions. Grant only the necessary permissions to the web server user and other required users/groups.
*   **Secure Default Permissions:**  Establish and enforce secure default permissions for all files and directories during Matomo installation and deployment.
*   **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate the deployment and configuration of Matomo with secure file permissions.
*   **Security Hardening Guides:**  Follow security hardening guides specifically for Matomo and the underlying operating system and web server.

#### 4.2. Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Files (e.g., configuration files) [CRITICAL NODE]

**Breakdown:**

*   **4.2.1. Exploiting Identified Misconfigurations:**
    *   **Direct File Access (Local Attacker):** If files like `config.ini.php` are world-readable, a local attacker can simply use commands like `cat /path/to/matomo/config/config.ini.php` to read the contents directly.
    *   **Web Server Exploitation (Remote/Local Attacker):**
        *   **Directory Traversal (if combined with other vulnerabilities):**  While not directly related to *file permissions* themselves, directory traversal vulnerabilities in the web application or web server could allow an attacker to bypass access controls and access files outside the intended web root, potentially including Matomo configuration files if permissions are weak.
        *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) (if combined with other vulnerabilities):**  If the Matomo application has an LFI vulnerability, an attacker could potentially use it to read local files, including configuration files, if permissions allow the web server user to read them.  Insecure file permissions would make LFI attacks more impactful.
    *   **Information Disclosure (if combined with other vulnerabilities):**  Information disclosure vulnerabilities (e.g., exposing directory listings, debug information) could indirectly reveal file paths and potentially permissions, aiding an attacker in targeting specific files.

*   **4.2.2. Sensitive Files at Risk in Matomo:**
    *   **`config/config.ini.php`:**  **CRITICAL:** Contains database credentials (username, password, database name, host), salts, secret keys, and potentially other sensitive configuration parameters. Access to this file is a **high-severity** compromise.
    *   **`misc/cron/config.ini.php` (if exists):**  May contain similar sensitive information for cron jobs.
    *   **Log files (`logs/` directory):**  Can contain sensitive information about user activity, system errors, and potentially even sensitive data logged by Matomo or plugins. While not as critical as database credentials, logs can aid in reconnaissance and further attacks.
    *   **Potentially plugin configuration files:**  Depending on the plugins installed, they might store sensitive information in their configuration files within the `plugins/` directory.

*   **4.2.3. Impact of Unauthorized Access:**
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, and user information.
    *   **Integrity Compromise:**  With database credentials, attackers can modify data within the Matomo database, potentially leading to data manipulation, defacement, or injection of malicious content.
    *   **Availability Impact:**  Attackers could potentially disrupt Matomo services by modifying configuration files to cause errors or by gaining control of the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):**  Database credentials obtained from `config.ini.php` could potentially be reused to access other systems or databases if the same credentials are used elsewhere (password reuse vulnerability).
    *   **Further Attacks:**  Access to sensitive information can be used to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks, such as SQL injection (if database credentials are compromised), account takeover, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Analysis of Critical Node 4.2:**

Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive files, especially `config.ini.php`, is a critical step that can lead to a full compromise of the Matomo application and potentially the underlying infrastructure. The impact is high due to the exposure of highly sensitive information.  The ease of gaining access depends directly on the severity of the file permission misconfigurations identified in the previous node.

**Mitigation for Critical Node 4.2:**

*   **Strict File Permissions (Primary Defense):**  The most effective mitigation is to **correctly configure file permissions** in the first place, as outlined in the mitigation for Critical Node 4.1. Ensure sensitive files like `config.ini.php` are *not* world-readable and are only accessible to the web server user and authorized administrators.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate any file permission vulnerabilities or other configuration weaknesses.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Level):**  Within the Matomo application itself, ensure that code accessing sensitive files operates with the least necessary privileges.
*   **Secure Configuration Practices:**
    *   **Separate Configuration from Code:**  While Matomo's `config.ini.php` is a configuration file, ensure that sensitive configuration data is not embedded directly in application code where possible.
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Consider using environment variables to store sensitive configuration data instead of directly in configuration files, although this still requires careful permission management for the environment variable storage mechanism.
    *   **Configuration File Encryption (Advanced):**  For highly sensitive deployments, consider encrypting configuration files at rest, although this adds complexity to key management.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block some attacks that might be used in conjunction with file permission vulnerabilities, such as directory traversal or LFI attempts.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  IDS/IPS can monitor for suspicious file access patterns and alert administrators to potential attacks.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit Insecure File Permissions" attack path, while seemingly basic, is a **high-risk path** in the context of Matomo.  Misconfigured file permissions, particularly on the `config/config.ini.php` file, can lead to a rapid and severe compromise.  The mitigation strategies are well-established and relatively straightforward to implement, emphasizing the importance of proper system administration and security hardening during Matomo deployment and ongoing maintenance.  Prioritizing secure file permissions is crucial for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a Matomo application and its sensitive data.
