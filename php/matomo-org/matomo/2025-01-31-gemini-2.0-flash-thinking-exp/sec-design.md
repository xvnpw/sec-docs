# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Matomo, is an open-source web analytics platform. The primary business goal is to provide website owners and digital marketers with a comprehensive and privacy-focused analytics solution. Matomo aims to be a viable alternative to proprietary analytics platforms, emphasizing data ownership and user privacy.

Business priorities include:
- Providing accurate and reliable web analytics data.
- Ensuring user privacy and data protection, complying with relevant regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
- Offering a feature-rich platform comparable to or exceeding competitors.
- Maintaining a stable, performant, and scalable platform.
- Fostering a strong open-source community and ecosystem.
- Offering both self-hosted and cloud-hosted solutions to cater to different user needs.

Key business risks to address:
- Data breaches and privacy violations leading to reputational damage and legal liabilities.
- Inaccurate or unreliable analytics data leading to poor business decisions by users.
- Performance and scalability issues affecting user experience and platform adoption.
- Security vulnerabilities in the platform being exploited by malicious actors.
- Competition from established analytics platforms and emerging privacy-focused alternatives.
- Dependence on community contributions and maintenance for the open-source version.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) - assumed to be in place, given the project's maturity and open-source nature, although specific details are not provided in the input.
- security control: Code reviews - likely practiced within the open-source contribution process, although the extent and rigor are not specified.
- security control: Input validation - expected to be implemented throughout the application to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
- security control: Authentication and Authorization - necessary for user access to analytics data and platform administration.
- security control: Encryption in transit (HTTPS) - standard practice for web applications, assumed to be enforced for both self-hosted and cloud versions.
- security control: Database security - assumed to be in place, including access controls and potentially encryption at rest.
- security control: Regular security updates - expected for an open-source project with a focus on security.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries - inherent risk in using external dependencies, mitigated by dependency scanning and updates.
- accepted risk: Security misconfigurations by self-hosted users - users self-hosting Matomo are responsible for their own server security.
- accepted risk: Social engineering attacks targeting Matomo users - users are responsible for their own account security practices.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security testing (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing by external security experts.
- security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
- security control: Enhance security logging and monitoring for proactive threat detection and incident response.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and защита от DDoS attacks to ensure availability.
- security control: Provide security hardening guides for self-hosted deployments.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for user logins (e.g., password-based with strong password policies, multi-factor authentication).
    - requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks and account enumeration.
    - requirement: Session management to prevent session hijacking.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to different features and data.
    - requirement: Granular permissions to control access to specific websites and analytics data.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege applied to user roles and system components.
- Input validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    - requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to neutralize potentially malicious input.
    - requirement: Use of parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Encryption of sensitive data at rest (e.g., personal data, API keys).
    - requirement: Secure key management practices for encryption keys.
    - requirement: Use of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    - requirement: HTTPS enforced for all communication to protect data in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:
- Collection of website visitor data: Essential for providing analytics services. Disruption or compromise can lead to inaccurate data and loss of trust.
- Processing and storage of analytics data: Core function of Matomo. Data loss or corruption can severely impact service delivery.
- Access to analytics dashboards and reports: How users interact with Matomo. Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches and privacy violations.
- User authentication and authorization: Controls access to the platform. Compromise can lead to unauthorized access and data manipulation.

Data to protect and sensitivity:
- Website visitor data: Potentially sensitive personal data depending on configuration and tracking settings (IP addresses, browsing behavior, etc.). High sensitivity due to privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
- User account credentials: Usernames and passwords for Matomo users. High sensitivity as compromise can lead to unauthorized access.
- API keys and access tokens: Used for API access. High sensitivity as compromise can lead to unauthorized data access and manipulation.
- Configuration data: Settings for Matomo platform and websites being tracked. Medium sensitivity as misconfiguration can lead to security vulnerabilities or data breaches.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific SSDLC practices are currently in place for Matomo development?
- Are there existing automated security testing tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline? If so, which ones?
- Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure program?
- What type of database is primarily used for Matomo deployments (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)?
- Are there specific security hardening guides available for self-hosted Matomo deployments?
- What are the typical data retention policies for website visitor data in Matomo?

Assumptions:
- Matomo aims to comply with relevant privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
- Security is a significant concern for the Matomo project, given its nature as an analytics platform handling potentially sensitive data.
- Standard web application security best practices are generally followed in the development of Matomo.
- The deployment model described (on-premises) is a common scenario for self-hosted Matomo instances.
- The build process includes basic security checks, but there is room for improvement with more comprehensive automated security testing.
