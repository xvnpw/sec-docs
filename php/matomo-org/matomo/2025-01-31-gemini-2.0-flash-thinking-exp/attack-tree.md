## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Matomo Software Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_matomo_software_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Matomo core software or its plugins. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other critical vulnerabilities.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Identify Outdated Matomo Version [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers first identify if the Matomo instance is running an outdated version. This is a crucial step as outdated versions are more likely to have known, unpatched vulnerabilities.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement version detection countermeasures and ensure Matomo is always updated to the latest stable version.
    *   **Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability (e.g., RCE, SQLi, XSS) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Once an outdated version is identified, attackers leverage publicly available exploits or develop their own to target known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Establish a robust patch management process to quickly apply security updates released by Matomo. Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases.
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Matomo Plugin [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Similar to core vulnerabilities, attackers identify vulnerable plugins. Plugins, especially third-party ones, can be less rigorously secured.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Maintain an inventory of installed plugins, keep them updated, and remove unnecessary or insecure plugins.
    *   **Exploit Publicly Disclosed Plugin Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated Matomo plugins, similar to core vulnerabilities.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Apply the same patch management and monitoring practices to plugins as to the Matomo core.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Matomo Configuration Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_matomo_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in the Matomo setup, such as default credentials, weak passwords, insecure file permissions, exposed sensitive information, or insecure API configurations.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Access Matomo Login Page [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:**  The Matomo login page is the entry point for credential-based attacks. It's usually publicly accessible.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** While the login page needs to be accessible, ensure it's protected by strong authentication mechanisms and consider rate limiting login attempts.
    *   **Attempt Default Credentials (e.g., admin/password) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers try default usernames and passwords (like `admin/password`) on the login page. Surprisingly, this still works in some cases.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  **Immediately** change default administrator credentials during Matomo installation.
    *   **Identify Misconfigured File Permissions on Matomo Files/Directories [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers look for incorrect file permissions that allow unauthorized access to sensitive Matomo files and directories.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Follow Matomo's recommended file permission settings. Regularly audit file permissions to ensure they are correctly configured.
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Files (e.g., configuration files) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:**  If file permissions are weak, attackers can access sensitive files like `config/config.ini.php`, which contains database credentials and other secrets.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Strictly control access to configuration files. Use operating system-level security to restrict access to only necessary users/processes.
    *   **Access Matomo Configuration Files (via file system access or misconfiguration) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers attempt to access configuration files through various means, including file system access due to misconfigurations or potentially web server vulnerabilities (though less directly a Matomo weakness).
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Harden the web server and operating system hosting Matomo to prevent unauthorized file system access.
    *   **Extract Sensitive Information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Once configuration files are accessed, attackers extract sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Beyond securing file access, consider encrypting sensitive data within configuration files if possible, or using environment variables for sensitive configurations instead of storing them directly in files.
    *   **Identify Exposed Matomo API Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers identify publicly accessible Matomo API endpoints.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Document and understand all exposed API endpoints. Implement proper access controls and authentication for all APIs.
    *   **Bypass API Authentication/Authorization (if weak or misconfigured) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers attempt to bypass or circumvent weak API authentication or authorization mechanisms.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Implement strong API authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and authorization. Follow security best practices for API security.
    *   **Abuse API for Malicious Purposes (e.g., data exfiltration, manipulation) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** If API authentication is bypassed, attackers can abuse the API for malicious actions like data exfiltration, data manipulation, or potentially gaining further access.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Monitor API usage for anomalies. Implement rate limiting and input validation for API requests to prevent abuse.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Phishing Targeting Matomo Users (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringphishing_targeting_matomo_users__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers use social engineering tactics, primarily phishing, to trick Matomo users into revealing their credentials or performing malicious actions within Matomo.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Craft Phishing Attack Targeting Matomo Users [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers create phishing emails or messages designed to look legitimate and target Matomo users (administrators, analysts, etc.).
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement email security measures (spam filters, DMARC, SPF, DKIM). Conduct regular security awareness training for users to recognize and report phishing attempts.
    *   **Trick User into Revealing Credentials or Executing Malicious Actions within Matomo [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** The phishing attack aims to steal login credentials or trick users into clicking malicious links or performing actions that compromise their accounts or Matomo itself.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**  Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Matomo user accounts to add an extra layer of security even if credentials are compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities to Compromise Matomo Installation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_to_compromise_matomo_installation__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and packages that Matomo depends on.
*   **Critical Node:**
    *   **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities to Compromise Matomo Installation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Breakdown:** If vulnerabilities exist in Matomo's dependencies, attackers can exploit them to compromise the Matomo installation. This is often more complex but can be effective.
        *   **Actionable Insight:** Implement dependency scanning and management practices. Regularly update Matomo dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools to monitor for and alert on dependency vulnerabilities.
