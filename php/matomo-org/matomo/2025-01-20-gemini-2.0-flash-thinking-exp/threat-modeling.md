# Threat Model Analysis for matomo-org/matomo

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Matomo Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_matomo_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities in the Matomo core application or its plugins. This often involves sending specially crafted requests directly to the Matomo instance to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact:**
* Gaining unauthorized access to the Matomo instance and its data.
* Executing arbitrary code on the server hosting Matomo, potentially compromising the entire server.
* Performing unauthorized actions within the Matomo instance, such as modifying data or creating new administrative accounts.
* Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the Matomo instance.

**Affected Component:** Matomo Core Application, Matomo Plugins

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Matomo to the latest stable version, including all security patches.
* Keep all Matomo plugins up-to-date.
* Subscribe to Matomo security advisories and mailing lists to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
* Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests targeting known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Matomo](./threats/sql_injection_in_matomo.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters directly processed by Matomo, allowing them to manipulate the underlying database. This occurs if Matomo's code does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries.

**Impact:**
* Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the Matomo database, including user tracking information.
* Modifying or deleting data in the Matomo database.
* Potentially gaining access to the underlying operating system if database user privileges are misconfigured.

**Affected Component:** Matomo Database Interaction Layer (likely within various modules handling data input)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Matomo is updated to the latest version, as newer versions often include fixes for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* If developing custom Matomo plugins or interacting with the Matomo database directly, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
* Regularly audit custom Matomo code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Matomo UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_matomo_ui.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into fields or areas within the Matomo user interface that are not properly sanitized. This injected script would then execute in the browsers of other users accessing the Matomo dashboard.

**Impact:**
* Stealing session cookies of Matomo users, allowing attackers to impersonate them.
* Performing unauthorized actions within the Matomo instance on behalf of the victim user.
* Defacing the Matomo dashboard for other users.
* Potentially gaining access to sensitive analytics data.

**Affected Component:** Matomo User Interface (various modules and views)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Matomo is updated to the latest version, as newer versions often include fixes for XSS vulnerabilities.
* If developing custom Matomo plugins, rigorously sanitize and encode all user-supplied input before displaying it in the UI.
* Implement appropriate output encoding techniques in the Matomo codebase.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Matomo Analytics Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_matomo_analytics_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access directly to the Matomo instance and the analytics data it collects. This could be due to weak credentials configured within Matomo, misconfigured access controls within Matomo, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in Matomo's authentication mechanisms.

**Impact:**
* Exposure of sensitive user tracking data, potentially violating privacy regulations.
* Competitors gaining insights into the application's user behavior and business strategies.
* Manipulation of analytics data to skew reports and impact decision-making.

**Affected Component:** Matomo Authentication and Authorization System, Matomo Database

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for Matomo user accounts.
* Regularly review and restrict user permissions within Matomo.
* Secure the server hosting Matomo and restrict network access to authorized individuals and systems.
* Use HTTPS to encrypt communication with the Matomo instance.

## Threat: [Insecure Matomo Plugin](./threats/insecure_matomo_plugin.md)

**Description:** A vulnerable or malicious Matomo plugin could introduce security risks directly to the Matomo instance. This could include vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, or remote code execution within the plugin's code.

**Impact:**
* Exploitation of plugin vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized access to the Matomo instance, data breaches within Matomo's data, or code execution on the server hosting Matomo.
* Malicious plugins could be designed to steal data directly from Matomo or compromise the Matomo instance.

**Affected Component:** Matomo Plugin System, Individual Matomo Plugins

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only install Matomo plugins from trusted sources.
* Regularly update all installed Matomo plugins.
* Review the permissions and code of plugins before installation if possible.
* Disable or uninstall plugins that are no longer needed or maintained.
