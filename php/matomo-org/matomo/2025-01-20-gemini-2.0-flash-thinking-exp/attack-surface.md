# Attack Surface Analysis for matomo-org/matomo

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Matomo Tracking Parameters](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_matomo_tracking_parameters.md)

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into Matomo tracking parameters (e.g., in the URL or POST data) and subsequently executed in the context of a user's browser when viewing Matomo reports.

**How Matomo Contributes:** Matomo stores and displays data from tracking requests, including parameters that can be manipulated by attackers. If Matomo doesn't properly sanitize this data before rendering it in the reports interface, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious JavaScript payload in a custom variable (`&customVar={"1":"<script>alert('XSS')</script>"}`). When a user views the report containing this data, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** Account compromise of Matomo users, including administrators, leading to data theft, manipulation of analytics data, or further attacks on the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Matomo Configuration:** Ensure Matomo is updated to the latest version, as updates often include security fixes for XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP on the Matomo instance to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Matomo instance and any custom plugins.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Matomo Core or Plugins](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_matomo_core_or_plugins.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are processed by Matomo's database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data in the Matomo database.

**How Matomo Contributes:** If Matomo's code or its plugins do not properly sanitize user inputs before constructing SQL queries, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection. This can occur in various parts of Matomo, including plugin functionalities and core features.

**Example:** A vulnerable Matomo plugin might accept user input for filtering reports without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject SQL code into this input field to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Matomo database, potentially exposing sensitive analytics data, user credentials, and even allowing for remote code execution on the underlying server in severe cases.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Matomo Updated:** Regularly update Matomo and all its plugins to the latest versions, as these often contain patches for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Plugin Management:** Only install plugins from trusted sources and regularly review installed plugins for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Ensure that Matomo's developers (and plugin developers) use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database to prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Matomo Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_matomo_plugins.md)

**Description:** Third-party Matomo plugins may contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, remote code execution) that can be exploited to compromise the Matomo instance or the underlying server.

**How Matomo Contributes:** Matomo's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but it also introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in these external components. Matomo's core team is not responsible for the security of all third-party plugins.

**Example:** A poorly coded plugin might have an unpatched XSS vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the Matomo interface.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from XSS and data theft to full server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Careful Plugin Selection:** Only install plugins from reputable sources and with good security track records.
*   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all installed plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Audits of Plugins:** If using custom or less common plugins, consider performing security audits or code reviews.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant plugins only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Matomo Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_matomo_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** Weak or default credentials, lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), or publicly accessible admin interfaces can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the Matomo administration panel.

**How Matomo Contributes:** Matomo provides an administrative interface for managing the platform. If this interface is not properly secured, it becomes a prime target for attackers.

**Example:** Using the default "admin" username and a weak password allows an attacker to easily log in to the Matomo instance.

**Impact:** Full control over the Matomo instance, including the ability to view sensitive data, modify configurations, inject malicious tracking code, and potentially gain access to the underlying server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all Matomo user accounts, especially administrator accounts.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all Matomo user accounts, especially administrator accounts.
*   **Restrict Access to Admin Interface:** Limit access to the Matomo admin interface by IP address or through a VPN.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Review user accounts and permissions regularly.
*   **Rename Default Admin User:** If possible, rename the default administrator user to something less predictable.
