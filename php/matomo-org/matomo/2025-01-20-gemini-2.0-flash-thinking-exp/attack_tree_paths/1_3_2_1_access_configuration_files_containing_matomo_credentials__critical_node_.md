**Attack Path:** 1.3.2.1 Access Configuration Files Containing Matomo Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This attack path represents a critical security risk as it targets the core security of the Matomo application by aiming to compromise its sensitive credentials. Successful exploitation grants an attacker significant control over the Matomo instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Mechanism:** LFI vulnerabilities occur when an application allows user-controlled input to be used in file path inclusion operations. An attacker can manipulate this input to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
    *   **Exploitation in Matomo Context:**  If Matomo has vulnerable scripts that accept file paths as parameters (e.g., in themes, plugins, or custom code), an attacker could craft a malicious request to include configuration files like `config/config.ini.php` or similar.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable script might have a parameter like `?page=`. An attacker could try `?page=../../../../config/config.ini.php` to traverse up the directory structure and access the configuration file.
    *   **Prerequisites:** The application must have an exploitable LFI vulnerability. This often arises from insecure coding practices where user input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in file inclusion functions.

*   **Misconfigured Access Controls:**
    *   **Mechanism:**  Incorrectly configured web server or operating system permissions can allow unauthorized access to sensitive files.
    *   **Exploitation in Matomo Context:**
        *   **Web Server Misconfiguration:** If the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is configured to serve the `config/` directory or its contents directly, an attacker could access the configuration files by simply browsing to the correct URL.
        *   **Operating System Permissions:** If the file system permissions on the `config/` directory or its files are too permissive (e.g., world-readable), an attacker with access to the server (even with limited privileges) could read the files.
        *   **Backup Files:**  Accidental exposure of backup files (e.g., `config.ini.php.bak`, `config.ini.php~`) in the webroot due to misconfiguration.
    *   **Prerequisites:**  Requires misconfiguration of the web server or operating system permissions. This can happen due to human error during setup or maintenance.

**Potential Vulnerabilities in Matomo Application:**

While Matomo core is generally secure, vulnerabilities can arise from:

*   **Third-party Plugins:**  Poorly coded or outdated plugins might introduce LFI vulnerabilities.
*   **Custom Themes:**  Custom themes developed without proper security considerations could contain LFI flaws.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) leading to LFI:** In some scenarios, an SSRF vulnerability could be chained with local file access to retrieve configuration files.
*   **Insecure File Upload Functionality:** If file upload functionality is not properly secured, attackers might be able to upload malicious files to locations from which they can then be included via LFI.
*   **Misconfiguration during Installation or Updates:**  Errors during the installation or update process could lead to incorrect file permissions.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

Gaining access to configuration files containing Matomo credentials has severe consequences:

*   **Database Credentials Compromise:** The `config.ini.php` file typically contains database credentials (username, password, host, database name). This allows the attacker to:
    *   **Access and Exfiltrate Sensitive Data:**  Retrieve all data stored in the Matomo database, including website analytics, user information, and potentially personally identifiable information (PII).
    *   **Modify or Delete Data:**  Alter or erase critical data, disrupting analytics and potentially causing reputational damage.
    *   **Gain Administrative Access to Matomo:**  Potentially create new administrative users or elevate privileges to existing accounts within Matomo.
*   **API Key Compromise:** Configuration files might contain API keys used for integrations with other services. This allows the attacker to:
    *   **Impersonate the Matomo Instance:**  Access external services using the compromised API keys.
    *   **Potentially Gain Access to Connected Systems:**  If the API keys provide access to sensitive systems, the attacker could pivot to these systems.
*   **Email Credentials Compromise:**  Configuration files might contain SMTP credentials used for sending emails from Matomo. This allows the attacker to:
    *   **Send Phishing Emails:**  Send malicious emails appearing to originate from the legitimate Matomo instance.
    *   **Gain Further Access:**  Potentially use email access for account recovery or other malicious purposes.
*   **Complete Takeover of Matomo Instance:** With access to database and potentially other credentials, the attacker effectively gains full control over the Matomo installation.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised credentials could potentially be reused to access other systems or services within the same network.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent and mitigate the risk of this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

**Prevention:**

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input to prevent LFI vulnerabilities. Avoid directly using user input in file inclusion functions.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the web server process with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, especially for custom plugins and themes.
*   **Strong Access Controls:**
    *   **Web Server Configuration:**  Ensure the web server is configured to prevent direct access to sensitive directories like `config/`. This can be achieved through directives like `<Directory>` in Apache or `location` blocks in Nginx.
    *   **Operating System Permissions:**  Set strict file system permissions on the `config/` directory and its files, ensuring they are readable only by the web server user and the Matomo administrator.
    *   **Disable Directory Listing:**  Disable directory listing for the webroot to prevent attackers from browsing the file structure.
*   **Regular Updates and Patching:**  Keep Matomo and all its plugins and themes up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Secure File Upload Handling:**  Implement robust security measures for file upload functionality, including input validation, file type restrictions, and storing uploaded files outside the webroot.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Disable any Matomo features or plugins that are not actively used to reduce the attack surface.

**Detection:**

*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Implement IDS/IPS rules to detect suspicious file access attempts or patterns indicative of LFI exploitation.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF to filter malicious requests and block attempts to access sensitive files.
*   **Log Monitoring and Analysis:**  Monitor web server access logs for unusual file requests or error messages that might indicate an attack. Implement alerting for suspicious activity.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use FIM tools to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.

**Response:**

*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to handle security breaches.
*   **Credential Rotation:**  Immediately rotate all compromised credentials (database, API keys, email) if an attack is suspected.
*   **System Restoration:**  Restore the system from a known good backup if necessary.
*   **Forensic Analysis:**  Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the attack.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path "Access Configuration Files Containing Matomo Credentials" represents a significant threat to the security of a Matomo application. Exploiting vulnerabilities like LFI or misconfigured access controls can lead to the compromise of sensitive credentials, resulting in data breaches, system takeover, and potential lateral movement. Implementing robust prevention, detection, and response strategies is crucial to mitigate this risk. The development team should prioritize secure coding practices, strong access controls, regular updates, and proactive monitoring to protect the Matomo application and its sensitive data.
