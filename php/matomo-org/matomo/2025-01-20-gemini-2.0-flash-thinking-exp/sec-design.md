## 4. Data Flow

The journey of website analytics data through the Matomo platform can be described as follows:

1. **User Interaction & Tracking Request:** A user interacts with a website or application that has Matomo tracking code implemented. This triggers a request sent to the Matomo Tracking API. The request includes details about the user's action, the page they visited, their browser information, and other relevant data.
2. **Tracking API Reception & Validation:** The Matomo Tracking API receives the request. It performs initial validation checks to ensure the data is in the expected format and contains necessary information.
3. **Data Queuing (Optional):** For high-traffic websites, tracking requests might be queued to prevent overload on the processing pipeline. Message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka can be used for this purpose.
4. **Data Processing & Enrichment:** The Data Processing Pipeline retrieves the tracking data. It enriches the data by adding information like the visitor's geographical location (using the GeoIP Database), device type, and operating system.
5. **Sessionization:** The pipeline identifies and groups individual tracking events into user sessions based on timestamps and user identifiers.
6. **Data Aggregation:**  Processed data is aggregated to calculate key metrics and statistics, such as page views, unique visitors, bounce rate, and conversion rates.
7. **Data Storage:** Both raw tracking events and aggregated data are stored in the database. The retention period for raw data is configurable.
8. **Report Request:** A user logs into the Matomo Web Interface and requests a specific report or navigates through the dashboards.
9. **Report Generation:** The Reporting Engine receives the request from the Web Interface. It queries the database for the necessary aggregated data based on the report parameters.
10. **Report Presentation:** The Reporting Engine formats the retrieved data, and the Web Interface displays the report to the user, often using charts and visualizations.
