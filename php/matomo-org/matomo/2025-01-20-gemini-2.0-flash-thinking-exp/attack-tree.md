## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Compromise Application via Matomo [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_compromise_application_via_matomo__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This represents the overall goal and the starting point for all identified high-risk paths. It signifies the attacker's focus on leveraging Matomo as the entry point.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Matomo Vulnerabilities Directly [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_matomo_vulnerabilities_directly__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities within Matomo's codebase directly. This often involves exploiting known weaknesses in outdated versions or, less frequently, zero-day vulnerabilities. Success here can grant significant control over Matomo and potentially the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Exploit Known Matomo Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_exploit_known_matomo_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Focusing on publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific Matomo versions. Attackers often scan for outdated installations to exploit these known weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2 Exploit Known Vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_exploit_known_vulnerability__e_g___sql_injection__xss__rce___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically targeting common web application vulnerabilities present in Matomo, such as SQL Injection (injecting malicious SQL queries), Cross-Site Scripting (injecting malicious scripts into web pages), or Remote Code Execution (executing arbitrary code on the server). Successful exploitation can lead to data breaches, session hijacking, or complete server takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Abuse Matomo Features for Malicious Purposes [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_abuse_matomo_features_for_malicious_purposes__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misusing legitimate features of Matomo to achieve malicious goals. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in input validation or access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Inject Malicious Code via Custom Variables/Events [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_inject_malicious_code_via_custom_variablesevents__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into custom variables or event tracking parameters. If Matomo doesn't properly sanitize this input, the malicious code can be executed when reports are viewed, leading to XSS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Access Matomo Reporting Interface [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_access_matomo_reporting_interface__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to Matomo's reporting interface. This can be achieved through default credentials, brute-forcing, or exploiting authentication bypass vulnerabilities. Once inside, attackers can view sensitive data (if previously injected) or potentially manipulate settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3 Manipulate Matomo Configuration for Malicious Gain [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_manipulate_matomo_configuration_for_malicious_gain__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Gaining unauthorized access to Matomo's configuration settings. This allows attackers to modify tracking code, add new users, or change other critical settings to their advantage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3.1 Exploit Access Control Weaknesses in Matomo [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_1_exploit_access_control_weaknesses_in_matomo__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in Matomo's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain administrative access. This could involve brute-forcing credentials or exploiting authentication bypass vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3.2 Modify Tracking Code or Settings](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_2_modify_tracking_code_or_settings.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Once configuration access is gained, attackers can modify the JavaScript tracking code injected into the application's pages.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3.2.1 Inject Malicious JavaScript into Tracking Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_2_1_inject_malicious_javascript_into_tracking_code__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code directly into the tracking code. This code will then be executed in the browsers of all users visiting the application, allowing for widespread attacks like session hijacking, credential theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Integration Weaknesses between Application and Matomo](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_integration_weaknesses_between_application_and_matomo.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Focusing on vulnerabilities arising from the way the application integrates with Matomo, particularly in how configuration data is handled.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Exploit Insecure Configuration of Matomo within Application [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_exploit_insecure_configuration_of_matomo_within_application__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application stores or manages Matomo's configuration, such as API keys or database credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2.1 Access Configuration Files Containing Matomo Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_1_access_configuration_files_containing_matomo_credentials__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining access to configuration files within the application's file system that contain sensitive Matomo credentials (e.g., database passwords, API keys). This can be achieved through vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion (LFI) or misconfigured access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2.2 Abuse Exposed Matomo API Keys or Tokens [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_2_abuse_exposed_matomo_api_keys_or_tokens__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Discovering and abusing Matomo API keys or tokens that are unintentionally exposed, for example, in client-side code, network traffic, or public repositories. With valid API keys, attackers can access and modify Matomo data and settings.
