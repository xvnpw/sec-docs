# Threat Model Analysis for matomo-org/matomo

## Threat: [Fake Tracking Data Injection (Spoofing)](./threats/fake_tracking_data_injection__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends HTTP requests directly to the `matomo.php` tracking endpoint, simulating legitimate user activity. They might use automated scripts to generate large volumes of fake page views, events, or conversions. They could also inject invalid or malicious data into custom dimensions or variables.
*   **Impact:** Skewed analytics data, leading to incorrect business decisions. Potential for denial-of-service if the volume of fake data is high enough. Data integrity is compromised. False positives in fraud detection systems relying on Matomo data.
*   **Affected Component:** `matomo.php` (Tracking API endpoint), `Tracker` class (and related methods for processing tracking requests).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory `token_auth`:** Require the `token_auth` parameter for all tracking requests. Treat this token as a secret and rotate it regularly.
    *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate all input parameters in tracking requests, including `_id` (visitor ID), `url`, `action_name`, custom dimensions, etc. Reject requests with invalid or unexpected data.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the `matomo.php` endpoint to prevent rapid injection of fake data. Consider different rate limits based on IP address, user agent, or other factors.
    *   **Referrer Validation:** If appropriate for the application, validate the `Referer` header (though it can be spoofed, it adds a layer of difficulty).
    *   **Server-Side Validation:** Whenever possible, validate user actions on the server-side *before* sending tracking data to Matomo. For example, don't track a "purchase" event until the purchase is confirmed in the backend.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor Matomo data for unusual spikes in traffic, unexpected patterns, or suspicious user behavior. Set up alerts for these anomalies.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use a CSP to restrict the domains from which tracking requests can originate.

## Threat: [Matomo Configuration Modification (Tampering)](./threats/matomo_configuration_modification__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Matomo *server* and modifies the `config/config.ini.php` file. They could change tracking settings, disable security features (like `token_auth`), alter database credentials, or inject malicious JavaScript into the tracking code. *This threat assumes the attacker has already bypassed server-level security.*
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Matomo installation. Data loss, data corruption, data exfiltration, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against users of the tracked websites. Loss of control over the analytics data.
*   **Affected Component:** `config/config.ini.php` (Main configuration file).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Permissions:** Set the most restrictive file permissions possible on `config/config.ini.php`. It should be readable only by the web server user and writable only by a designated administrator account (and ideally, only during configuration changes).
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use a FIM tool to monitor the integrity of `config/config.ini.php` and alert on any unauthorized changes.
    *   **Version Control:** Store the configuration file in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.

## Threat: [Matomo Database Modification (Tampering)](./threats/matomo_database_modification__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains *direct* access to the Matomo *database*. They could alter or delete tracking data, inject malicious data, or extract sensitive information. *This threat assumes the attacker has already bypassed server and application-level security to reach the database directly.*
*   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, data exfiltration. Compromised data integrity. Potential for denial-of-service if the database is corrupted or overloaded.
*   **Affected Component:** Matomo database (all tables).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Database Credentials:** Use a strong, unique password for the Matomo database user. Avoid using the default credentials.
    *   **Database Access Control:** Restrict database access to only the necessary hosts (typically the web server). Use a firewall to block external access to the database port.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User):** Grant the Matomo database user only the minimum necessary privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on the Matomo tables). Do not grant administrative privileges.
    *   **Database Monitoring and Auditing:** Implement database monitoring and auditing to detect unauthorized access or modifications.
    *   **Regular Backups:** Regularly back up the Matomo database to a secure location. Test the restoration process regularly.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation/Modification (Tampering)](./threats/malicious_plugin_installationmodification__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker installs a malicious plugin through the Matomo Marketplace or by directly uploading it to the server. Alternatively, they might modify an existing plugin to inject malicious code. The malicious plugin could steal data, modify tracking behavior, or provide a backdoor to the server.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data corruption, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, denial-of-service, complete server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `plugins/` directory, individual plugin files, Plugin API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Sources:** Only install plugins from the official Matomo Marketplace or other trusted sources. Verify the reputation and reviews of the plugin developer.
    *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep all plugins up to date. Enable automatic updates if available and reliable.
    *   **Plugin Review:** Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are unnecessary or suspicious.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor the `plugins/` directory for unauthorized changes.
    *   **Code Review (if possible):** If you have the expertise, review the source code of plugins before installing them, especially if they are from less-known sources.

## Threat: [Raw Tracking Data Exposure (Information Disclosure)](./threats/raw_tracking_data_exposure__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the raw tracking data stored in the Matomo *database*, either through direct database access or by exploiting a vulnerability in Matomo or another application. This data could include IP addresses, user IDs, browsing history, custom dimensions, and other potentially sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Privacy violation, potential for identity theft, reputational damage, legal consequences (depending on data privacy regulations).
*   **Affected Component:** Matomo database (especially tables like `log_visit`, `log_link_visit_action`, `log_conversion`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Database Security:** Implement all database security measures described in the "Matomo Database Modification" threat.
    *   **Data Anonymization:** Use Matomo's built-in data anonymization features, such as IP address masking, user ID pseudonymization, and data retention policies.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Only collect the data that is absolutely necessary for your analytics needs. Avoid collecting sensitive personal information if possible.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt the database at rest using database-level encryption or full-disk encryption.
    *   **Encryption in Transit:** Ensure that all communication between the web server and the database server is encrypted (e.g., using TLS/SSL).
    *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to the Matomo database to only authorized personnel.

## Threat: [Administrative Account Compromise (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/administrative_account_compromise__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a Matomo administrative account, either through password guessing, phishing, session hijacking, or exploiting a vulnerability in Matomo. With administrative access, they can control all aspects of the Matomo installation.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Matomo installation. Data loss, data corruption, data exfiltration, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, denial-of-service.
*   **Affected Component:** Matomo user authentication system, administrative interface.
