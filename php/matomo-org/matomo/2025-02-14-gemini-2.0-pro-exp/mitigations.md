# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for matomo-org/matomo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Strict Access Control (within Matomo)](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa__and_strict_access_control__within_matomo_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable MFA Plugin:** Install and activate a Matomo MFA plugin (e.g., "TwoFactorAuth").
2.  **Configure MFA:** Configure the plugin to require MFA for all user roles, or at minimum, for "Admin" and "Super User" roles.
3.  **User Setup:** Instruct users to set up MFA on their accounts (typically using a mobile authenticator app).
4.  **Enforce Least Privilege:** Within Matomo's user management, assign the *minimum* necessary permissions to each user based on their roles.  Use Matomo's built-in roles (View, Write, Admin, Super User) appropriately.  Avoid granting "Super User" access unless absolutely essential. Create custom roles if needed.
5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically (e.g., quarterly) review user accounts and permissions within Matomo to ensure they remain appropriate.
6. **Disable Default "Anonymous" User:** Ensure the default "anonymous" user has minimal or no permissions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dashboard (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from gaining access to the Matomo dashboard even if they obtain a user's password.
    *   **Data Breach (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of an attacker accessing and exfiltrating sensitive analytics data.
    *   **Account Takeover (Severity: High):** Makes it significantly harder for attackers to compromise user accounts.
    *   **Insider Threat (Severity: Medium):** Limits the damage a malicious or compromised insider can do by restricting their access within Matomo.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced by ~90% (assuming strong passwords are also enforced).
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced by ~70% (as part of a layered defense).
    *   **Account Takeover:** Risk reduced by ~95%.
    *   **Insider Threat:** Risk reduced by ~60% (depending on the insider's original privileges).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   MFA plugin is installed and enabled.
    *   MFA is enforced for "Admin" and "Super User" roles.
    *   Least privilege is *partially* implemented; some users have more permissions than strictly necessary.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   MFA is *not* enforced for "View" and "Write" roles.
    *   A full review of user permissions and role assignments within Matomo has not been conducted recently.
    *   Regular, scheduled review of user access within Matomo is not yet formalized.
    * Default "Anonymous" user still has some permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Updates (Matomo Plugins Only)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_updates__matomo_plugins_only_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Establish a Plugin Policy:** Create a written policy outlining criteria for selecting and approving Matomo plugins (e.g., reputable source, active maintenance, security reviews). This policy should be specific to Matomo plugins.
2.  **Vetting Process:** Before installing *any* Matomo plugin, review its source (if available), check its reviews and download counts on the Matomo Marketplace, and research the developer's reputation.
3.  **Staging Environment:** Install and test new Matomo plugins in a staging environment *before* deploying them to production.
4.  **Automated Updates (with Testing):** Configure automated updates for Matomo plugins (through Matomo's built-in update mechanism), but *always* test these updates in staging first.
5.  **Security Notifications:** Subscribe to Matomo's security announcements and plugin update notifications (specifically for installed plugins).
6.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically (e.g., annually) conduct a security audit of all installed Matomo plugins, including code reviews if possible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of installing Matomo plugins with XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Malicious Plugins (Severity: High):** Prevents the installation of intentionally malicious Matomo plugins.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugins (Severity: Medium):** Ensures that known vulnerabilities in Matomo plugins are patched promptly.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of a compromised Matomo plugin repository distributing malicious updates.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced by ~80% (with a strong CSP in place, although CSP is not Matomo-specific).
    *   **Malicious Plugins:** Risk reduced by ~90%.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugins:** Risk reduced by ~85% (with timely updates).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduced by ~60% (with careful vetting).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Automated updates are enabled for Matomo plugins.
    *   Updates are tested in a staging environment before deployment.
    *   Basic vetting is performed before installing new plugins (checking reviews).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal Matomo-specific plugin policy is not documented.
    *   In-depth vetting (source code review) is not consistently performed.
    *   Regular security audits of Matomo plugins are not conducted.
    *   Subscription to all relevant security notification channels (specifically for installed plugins) is not confirmed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Privacy-Focused Configuration (within Matomo)](./mitigation_strategies/privacy-focused_configuration__within_matomo_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Data Minimization:** Within Matomo's settings, review all tracked data points and disable any that are not strictly necessary.  Avoid collecting PII unless absolutely required and with explicit consent. Use Matomo's features to exclude specific data points.
2.  **IP Anonymization:** Enable IP anonymization in Matomo's privacy settings.  Choose the appropriate level of anonymization (e.g., masking 1, 2, or 3 octets).
3.  **Do Not Track (DNT):** Enable Matomo's support for the DNT header in the privacy settings.
4.  **Consent Management:** Use Matomo's built-in consent features or integrate with a dedicated Consent Management Platform (CMP) to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting any data, especially PII. Configure Matomo to require consent before tracking.
5.  **Data Retention Policy:** Configure Matomo's data retention settings to automatically delete data older than the specified retention period (defined in your organization's data retention policy).
6. **Regular Privacy Audits:** Conduct regular privacy audits (e.g., annually) to ensure that Matomo is configured and used in compliance with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and your organization's privacy policies. Review Matomo's settings and configurations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privacy Violations (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of collecting or processing personal data without proper consent or in violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Data Breach (Severity: High):** Minimizing the amount of sensitive data collected reduces the impact of a potential data breach.
    *   **Regulatory Non-Compliance (Severity: High):** Helps ensure compliance with data privacy laws and regulations.
    *   **Reputational Damage (Severity: Medium):** Demonstrates a commitment to user privacy.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privacy Violations:** Risk reduced by ~85% (with comprehensive privacy controls within Matomo).
    *   **Data Breach (impact):** Impact reduced by ~50% (by minimizing sensitive data).
    *   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Risk reduced by ~90%.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Risk reduced by ~70%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   IP anonymization is enabled.
    * Data retention policy is defined and configured in Matomo.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Data minimization has not been fully reviewed and implemented within Matomo's settings.
    *   DNT support is *not* enabled.
    *   A comprehensive consent management mechanism using Matomo's features or a CMP is *not* fully implemented.
    *   Regular privacy audits focusing on Matomo's configuration are not conducted.
