# Attack Surface Analysis for matomo-org/matomo

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Tracking Parameters](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_tracking_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into tracking parameters. If Matomo doesn't properly sanitize this input, the script could execute in the context of a Matomo administrator's browser when viewing reports.
    *   **How Matomo Contributes:** Matomo's core functionality involves storing and displaying data received from tracking requests. This data handling is the direct source of the XSS risk if not performed securely.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a tracking request with a custom variable containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If Matomo fails to encode this before displaying it in the reporting interface, the script executes.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of Matomo administrator accounts, data theft, defacement of the Matomo interface, potential for further attacks against the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Encoding (Verify Matomo's Implementation):** While Matomo *should* handle output encoding, *actively verify* this. Use browser developer tools to inspect the HTML source and confirm that potentially dangerous characters are properly encoded (e.g., `<` becomes `&lt;`).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a *strong* CSP on the Matomo interface. This is a *critical* defense-in-depth measure. A well-configured CSP prevents the execution of inline scripts, even if output encoding fails. Example: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-yourGeneratedNonce'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';` (replace `'nonce-yourGeneratedNonce'` with a dynamically generated nonce, and ensure the nonce is used correctly in your script tags).
        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities within the Matomo interface and any installed plugins.
        *   **Stay Updated:** Keep Matomo and all plugins updated to the latest versions. Security patches frequently address XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party Matomo plugins can introduce a wide range of vulnerabilities, including XSS, SQL injection, file upload vulnerabilities, and more. This is a direct attack surface introduced by Matomo's extensibility.
    *   **How Matomo Contributes:** Matomo's plugin architecture allows for third-party code execution within the Matomo environment. This inherently introduces the risk of vulnerabilities present in that third-party code.
    *   **Example:** A poorly coded plugin might not sanitize user input before using it in a database query (SQL injection), or it might allow unrestricted file uploads (leading to web shell execution).
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, but can range from data breaches to complete server compromise, depending on the specific plugin vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Plugin Selection:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (preferably the official Matomo marketplace). Review the plugin's code (if available), reputation, and security history.
        *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update *all* installed plugins to their latest versions. This is *crucial* for patching known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** If possible, run Matomo with limited privileges on the server. This minimizes the impact of a plugin compromise.
        *   **Disable Unused Plugins:** Remove any plugins that are not actively in use. This reduces the attack surface.
        *   **Code Review (if feasible):** If you have the expertise, perform a code review of any critical plugins before deployment, focusing on security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass (Matomo Admin Interface)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__matomo_admin_interface_.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in Matomo's authentication mechanisms could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the administration interface.
    *   **How Matomo Contributes:** Matomo provides its own built-in authentication system. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in *this system* are the direct cause of this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might use brute-force attacks against weak passwords, exploit a vulnerability in the password reset functionality, or use session hijacking if session management is insecure.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Matomo installation, access to all tracked data, potential for further attacks against the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Passwords and Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for all Matomo administrator accounts (minimum length, complexity, regular changes).
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable and *require* MFA for *all* Matomo administrator accounts. Matomo supports plugins for various MFA methods. This is a *critical* mitigation.
        *   **Regularly Review User Permissions:** Ensure only necessary users have administrative access, and their permissions are appropriately limited (principle of least privilege).
        *   **Secure Session Management:** Ensure Matomo uses secure session management:
            *   **HTTPS:** *Always* use HTTPS for the Matomo interface.
            *   **Secure Cookies:** Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on all Matomo cookies.
            *   **Session Timeouts:** Configure appropriate session timeouts.
            *   **Session ID Regeneration:** Verify that Matomo regenerates session IDs after a successful login.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (within Matomo or Plugins)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__within_matomo_or_plugins_.md)

*   **Description:** Although Matomo itself is generally well-protected, vulnerabilities *could* exist, especially in custom plugins or older, unpatched versions of Matomo.
    *   **How Matomo Contributes:** Matomo relies on a database. Any code within Matomo or its plugins that interacts with the database presents a potential SQL injection risk.
    *   **Example:** A poorly coded plugin might not properly escape user input before using it in a SQL query.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, potential for complete database server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Matomo and Plugins Updated:** This is the *most important* mitigation. Updates often include security fixes.
        *   **Database User Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege):** The database user Matomo connects with should have *only* the necessary privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on the Matomo database). It should *not* have administrative privileges on the entire database server.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block SQL injection attempts. Configure rules specific to Matomo.
        *   **Code Review (for custom plugins):** If developing custom plugins, perform thorough code reviews, focusing on database interactions. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements *exclusively*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration (Defaults and Misconfigurations - specifically `config/config.ini.php` exposure)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration__defaults_and_misconfigurations_-_specifically__configconfig_ini_php__exposur_d004fa02.md)

*    **Description:** Exposing the `config/config.ini.php` file.
    *    **How Matomo Contributes:** This file is part of Matomo and contains sensitive information.
    *    **Example:** Accessing yoursite.com/matomo/config/config.ini.php and seeing database credentials.
    *    **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Matomo database.
    *    **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`.htaccess` (Apache) or `web.config` (IIS):** Use server configuration files to deny direct access to the `config` directory. For Apache:
            ```apache
            <Files "*">
                Require all denied
            </Files>
            ```
        *   **Move Config File (Recommended):** Move `config.ini.php` *outside* of the web root. Matomo provides instructions for this.
