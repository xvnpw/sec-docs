# Deep Analysis: Matomo Attack Tree - Super User Access

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Super User Access" attack path within the Matomo attack tree.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies related to gaining unauthorized super user privileges within a Matomo instance.  This analysis will inform development and security practices to reduce the likelihood and impact of such an attack.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Super User Access" node of the Matomo attack tree.  This includes:

*   **Target System:**  A Matomo instance, assuming it's deployed using recommended configurations (e.g., not running as root, using a dedicated database user with limited privileges).  We'll consider both self-hosted and cloud-hosted (if applicable) scenarios, noting differences where relevant.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  We'll consider attackers with varying levels of sophistication, from opportunistic script kiddies to advanced persistent threats (APTs).  We'll assume the attacker has *no* initial legitimate access to the Matomo instance.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover attacks that rely on physical access to the server, denial-of-service attacks (unless they directly contribute to gaining super user access), or social engineering attacks targeting legitimate super users (although we'll touch on phishing as a potential credential theft method).  We also won't deeply analyze every possible vulnerability in every possible plugin; we'll focus on core Matomo and common attack patterns.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Attack Tree Decomposition:** We'll break down the "Super User Access" node into its constituent sub-nodes (attack vectors).  This will involve brainstorming and researching known Matomo vulnerabilities and attack techniques.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** For each identified attack vector, we'll analyze:
    *   **Vulnerability Type:**  (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Authentication Bypass).
    *   **Technical Details:**  How the vulnerability works, specific code locations (if known and publicly disclosed), and required conditions.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**  A step-by-step description of how an attacker would exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:**  An assessment of how likely this attack vector is to be successful (Low, Medium, High).  This considers factors like the prevalence of the vulnerability, the difficulty of exploitation, and the effectiveness of common mitigations.
    *   **Impact:**  The potential damage caused by successful exploitation (Low, Medium, High, Very High).  This considers data breaches, system compromise, and reputational damage.
    *   **Effort:**  The estimated effort required for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability (Low, Medium, High).
    *   **Skill Level:** The technical skill level required for an attacker (Low, Medium, High).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** How difficult it is to detect the attack (Low, Medium, High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Specific recommendations to prevent or mitigate the vulnerability.  This includes code changes, configuration adjustments, and security best practices.
3.  **Threat Modeling:** We'll consider different attacker profiles and their likely attack paths.
4.  **Documentation:**  All findings will be documented in this report, including clear recommendations for the development team.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Super User Access

We'll decompose the "Super User Access" node into the following sub-nodes (attack vectors).  This is not exhaustive, but represents a comprehensive starting point:

**A. Credential Compromise**

*   **A1. Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:**  Weak Authentication, Lack of Rate Limiting.
    *   **Technical Details:**  Attackers use automated tools to try common passwords or credentials leaked from other breaches.  Matomo's login form is the target.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        1.  Obtain a list of potential usernames (e.g., "admin," "administrator," common employee names).
        2.  Use a tool like Hydra or Burp Suite Intruder to submit login attempts with various passwords.
        3.  If successful, gain super user access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if weak passwords are used and rate limiting is not properly configured).
    *   **Impact:** Very High.
    *   **Effort:** Low.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if logging and monitoring are in place).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce strong password policies:**  Minimum length, complexity requirements, and password expiration.
        *   **Implement robust rate limiting:**  Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user within a given time period.  Consider using exponential backoff.
        *   **Implement account lockout:**  Temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  This is the *most effective* mitigation.  Require a second factor (e.g., TOTP, SMS code) in addition to the password.
        *   **Monitor login logs:**  Regularly review login logs for suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.
        *   **CAPTCHA:** Implement CAPTCHA to prevent automated brute-force attacks.

*   **A2. Phishing/Social Engineering:**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:**  Human Vulnerability.
    *   **Technical Details:**  Attackers trick legitimate super users into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails, websites, or other communication channels.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        1.  Craft a convincing phishing email that appears to be from Matomo or a trusted source.
        2.  Include a link to a fake Matomo login page that captures credentials.
        3.  Send the email to targeted super users.
        4.  If the user enters their credentials on the fake page, the attacker gains access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.
    *   **Impact:** Very High.
    *   **Effort:** Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (relies on user awareness and reporting).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User education and training:**  Train users to recognize phishing attempts and report suspicious emails.
        *   **Email security gateways:**  Implement email filtering to block phishing emails.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Even if credentials are stolen, MFA prevents unauthorized access.
        *   **Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM):** Implement these email authentication protocols to help prevent email spoofing.

*   **A3. Session Hijacking:**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:**  Insufficient Session Management, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Technical Details:**  Attackers steal a valid session cookie from a super user, allowing them to impersonate the user without needing their credentials.  This often relies on XSS vulnerabilities to inject malicious JavaScript that steals the cookie.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        1.  Identify an XSS vulnerability in Matomo (e.g., in a plugin or a custom theme).
        2.  Craft a malicious JavaScript payload that steals the session cookie.
        3.  Inject the payload into the vulnerable page (e.g., through a comment field, a forum post, or a crafted URL).
        4.  When a super user visits the compromised page, their session cookie is sent to the attacker.
        5.  The attacker uses the stolen cookie to access Matomo as the super user.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if Matomo and plugins are kept up-to-date and XSS protections are in place).
    *   **Impact:** Very High.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prevent XSS vulnerabilities:**  Use secure coding practices, input validation, output encoding, and a Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   **Use HttpOnly cookies:**  Mark session cookies as HttpOnly, preventing JavaScript from accessing them.
        *   **Use Secure cookies:**  Transmit cookies only over HTTPS.
        *   **Implement session timeouts:**  Automatically expire sessions after a period of inactivity.
        *   **Regularly update Matomo and plugins:**  Patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block XSS attacks.
        *   **Session ID regeneration:** Regenerate the session ID after a successful login.

**B. Exploiting Vulnerabilities**

*   **B1. SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:**  SQL Injection.
    *   **Technical Details:**  Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields that are not properly sanitized, allowing them to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the Matomo database.  This could allow them to retrieve super user credentials or modify the database to grant themselves super user privileges.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        1.  Identify a vulnerable input field (e.g., a search field, a form input).
        2.  Craft a malicious SQL query that retrieves the `login` and `password` from the `matomo_user` table where `superuser_access` is 1.
        3.  Inject the query into the vulnerable input field.
        4.  If successful, the attacker obtains the super user credentials.  Alternatively, they could modify the `superuser_access` field for their own account.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if Matomo's core code is properly secured and input validation is used).  Higher if using outdated versions or vulnerable plugins.
    *   **Impact:** Very High.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if database query logging and intrusion detection systems are in place).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use parameterized queries (prepared statements):**  This is the *most effective* mitigation.  Never concatenate user input directly into SQL queries.
        *   **Input validation and sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all user input before using it in SQL queries.  Use whitelisting whenever possible.
        *   **Least privilege principle:**  Ensure the database user that Matomo connects with has only the necessary privileges.  It should *not* have super user privileges on the database.
        *   **Regularly update Matomo and plugins:**  Patch known SQLi vulnerabilities.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block SQLi attacks.
        *   **Database query logging:**  Log all database queries to help detect suspicious activity.

*   **B2. Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:**  Remote Code Execution.
    *   **Technical Details:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that allow them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Matomo.  This could be through vulnerabilities in Matomo itself, in installed plugins, or in the underlying server software (e.g., PHP, web server).
    *   **Exploitation Steps:** (Highly variable depending on the specific vulnerability)
        1.  Identify an RCE vulnerability (e.g., a file upload vulnerability, a deserialization vulnerability, a command injection vulnerability).
        2.  Craft a malicious payload that executes arbitrary code on the server.
        3.  Exploit the vulnerability to upload or inject the payload.
        4.  Once the code is executed, the attacker can potentially gain full control of the server, including access to Matomo's database and configuration files.  They could then create a new super user account or modify an existing one.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if Matomo, plugins, and the server software are kept up-to-date and secure configurations are used).
    *   **Impact:** Very High.
    *   **Effort:** High.
    *   **Skill Level:** High.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update Matomo, plugins, and all server software:**  Patch known RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   **Secure file uploads:**  Validate file types, restrict file sizes, and store uploaded files outside the web root.
        *   **Disable unnecessary PHP functions:**  Disable functions like `exec`, `system`, `passthru`, etc., if they are not required.
        *   **Use a secure configuration:**  Follow security best practices for configuring PHP, the web server, and the operating system.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block RCE attacks.
        *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):**  Monitor for suspicious activity and potentially block attacks.
        *   **Least privilege principle:** Run Matomo with the least privileges necessary. Do not run it as root.

*   **B3. Authentication Bypass:**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:** Authentication Bypass
    *   **Technical Details:** Attackers find ways to bypass Matomo's authentication mechanisms altogether, gaining access to the application without providing valid credentials. This could be due to flaws in the authentication logic, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities in third-party authentication integrations.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:** (Highly variable depending on the specific vulnerability)
        1. Identify a flaw in the authentication process. This might involve manipulating URL parameters, exploiting session management weaknesses, or leveraging vulnerabilities in third-party authentication providers.
        2. Craft a request that bypasses the authentication checks.
        3. If successful, gain unauthorized access to Matomo, potentially with super user privileges if the bypass affects the super user authentication flow.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if Matomo's authentication mechanisms are properly implemented and configured).
    *   **Impact:** Very High.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly test authentication mechanisms:** Conduct rigorous testing, including penetration testing, to identify and address any weaknesses in the authentication flow.
        *   **Follow secure coding practices:** Ensure that authentication logic is robust and resistant to bypass attempts.
        *   **Regularly review and update authentication configurations:** Ensure that configurations are secure and follow best practices.
        *   **Use strong session management:** Implement secure session management practices, including proper session ID generation, storage, and handling.
        *   **Monitor authentication logs:** Regularly review authentication logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts and unusual access patterns.

**C. Leveraging Existing Access**

*   **C1. Privilege Escalation from Lower-Privileged User:**
    *   **Vulnerability Type:**  Privilege Escalation.
    *   **Technical Details:**  An attacker who has already gained access to a lower-privileged Matomo account (e.g., a "view" or "write" user) exploits a vulnerability to elevate their privileges to super user.  This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in Matomo's permission system, in plugins, or in the underlying server software.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        1.  Gain access to a lower-privileged Matomo account (e.g., through phishing, brute-force, or exploiting a vulnerability).
        2.  Identify a privilege escalation vulnerability (e.g., a vulnerability that allows a "write" user to modify user roles).
        3.  Exploit the vulnerability to grant themselves super user privileges.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if Matomo's permission system is properly implemented and plugins are secure).
    *   **Impact:** Very High.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update Matomo and plugins:**  Patch known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
        *   **Follow the principle of least privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Thoroughly test the permission system:**  Conduct rigorous testing to ensure that users cannot elevate their privileges beyond what is intended.
        *   **Secure coding practices:**  Ensure that code that handles user roles and permissions is robust and resistant to manipulation.
        *   **Audit user roles and permissions:**  Regularly review user roles and permissions to ensure they are appropriate.
