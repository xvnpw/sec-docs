Okay, let's create a design document for the Matomo project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Matomo is an open-source web analytics platform, a competitor to Google Analytics.  Its primary business goals revolve around providing users with a privacy-focused alternative for tracking website traffic and user behavior.  Success is measured by user adoption, active installations, and contributions to the open-source project.  The business model likely includes a combination of:

*   Free, self-hosted version (driving adoption and brand awareness).
*   Paid cloud-hosted version (generating revenue).
*   Paid premium plugins/features (generating revenue).
*   Enterprise support and services (generating revenue for larger clients).

Given this, the business priorities are:

1.  Maintaining User Trust:  Privacy is a core selling point. Any security breach or perception of compromised privacy would be extremely damaging.
2.  Data Accuracy and Reliability:  The analytics data must be accurate and reliable for users to make informed decisions.
3.  Platform Availability and Performance:  The platform (both self-hosted and cloud-hosted) needs to be available and performant to handle potentially large volumes of tracking data.
4.  Open Source Community Health:  A vibrant and active community is crucial for contributions, bug fixes, and overall project sustainability.
5.  Scalability: Ability to handle growing number of users and web sites.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

1.  Data Breach:  Unauthorized access to user tracking data, potentially exposing sensitive information about website visitors.
2.  Data Manipulation:  Malicious actors altering tracking data, leading to incorrect analytics and potentially flawed business decisions.
3.  Denial of Service:  Attacks that make the platform unavailable, disrupting tracking and access to analytics dashboards.
4.  Reputation Damage:  Any security incident, even a minor one, could significantly damage Matomo's reputation as a privacy-focused platform.
5.  Compromise of Cloud Infrastructure:  For the cloud-hosted version, a compromise of the underlying infrastructure could expose all hosted data.
6.  Supply Chain Attacks:  Vulnerabilities introduced through third-party libraries or dependencies could be exploited.
7.  Plugin Vulnerabilities:  Security flaws in third-party plugins could compromise individual Matomo installations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of web applications and open-source projects, here's a likely security posture:

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input Validation: Matomo likely implements input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. Implemented in application code.
*   security control: Output Encoding: To prevent XSS, output encoding is likely used when displaying data in the user interface. Implemented in application code.
*   security control: Authentication: User authentication is required to access the Matomo dashboard and configure settings. Implemented in application code, described in Matomo documentation.
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) likely restricts user access to specific features and data based on their assigned roles. Implemented in application code, described in Matomo documentation.
*   security control: Session Management: Secure session management practices are likely in place to prevent session hijacking. Implemented in application code.
*   security control: CSRF Protection: Measures to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks are likely implemented. Implemented in application code.
*   security control: Regular Updates: The Matomo project releases regular updates to address security vulnerabilities and bug fixes. Described in Matomo documentation and release notes.
*   security control: Security Advisories: Matomo publishes security advisories to inform users about known vulnerabilities and their remediation. Described in Matomo documentation.
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses dependency management tools (like Composer for PHP) to manage third-party libraries. Described in `composer.json` file.
*   security control: Code Reviews: Code reviews are likely part of the development process to identify potential security issues before they are merged. Described in contribution guidelines.
*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Matomo supports 2FA for enhanced account security. Implemented in application code, described in Matomo documentation.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Matomo can be configured with CSP to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks. Described in Matomo documentation.
*   security control: HTTP Security Headers: Matomo recommends configuring various HTTP security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options) to enhance browser security. Described in Matomo documentation.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities: While Matomo itself may be secure, third-party plugins can introduce vulnerabilities. Users are responsible for vetting and updating plugins.
*   accepted risk: Self-Hosting Security: Users who self-host Matomo are responsible for securing their own server infrastructure.
*   accepted risk: Configuration Errors: Misconfiguration of Matomo or its environment can lead to security vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Regularly perform DAST scans on running instances of Matomo to identify vulnerabilities in the live application.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies and ensure they are up-to-date.
*   security control: Penetration Testing: Conduct regular penetration tests by security experts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Bug Bounty Program: Consider establishing a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Secrets Management: Implement a robust secrets management solution to securely store and manage API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies (length, complexity, expiration).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks (account lockout, rate limiting).
    *   Secure storage of password hashes (using strong, salted hashing algorithms).
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA).
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control to different features and data.
    *   Principle of least privilege (users should only have access to what they need).
    *   Regular review of user permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user-supplied input on the server-side.
    *   Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good characters and patterns).
    *   Sanitize input to prevent code injection (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (e.g., using HTTPS).
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Properly validate SSL/TLS certificates.

2.  Continuous Integration (CI):  A CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) automatically triggers builds on each commit.
3.  Dependency Management: Composer (PHP) is used to manage dependencies.
4.  Build Steps:
    *   Checkout Code: The CI system checks out the latest code from the repository.
    *   Install Dependencies: Composer installs the required PHP dependencies.
    *   Run Tests: Unit tests, integration tests, and potentially other tests are executed.
    *   Static Analysis: Linters (e.g., PHPStan) and static analysis tools check for code quality and potential security issues.
    *   Build Artifacts: The build process creates the necessary files for deployment (e.g., PHP files, JavaScript files, CSS files).
    *   Create Docker Image (for Docker deployments): A Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image containing the Matomo application.
    *   Push Docker Image (for Docker deployments): The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
5.  Release:  A new release is tagged in the Git repository, and the build artifacts are made available for download.
