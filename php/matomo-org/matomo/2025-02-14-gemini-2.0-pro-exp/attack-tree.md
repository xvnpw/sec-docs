## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Matomo [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_matomo__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the overall attacker objective and is the root of the entire attack tree. It signifies a successful compromise of the application using Matomo.
*   **Likelihood:** (Dependent on the success of sub-nodes)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise of the application)
*   **Effort:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*   **Skill Level:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node representing the attacker gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Matomo. This is the most severe outcome.
*   **Likelihood:** (Dependent on the success of sub-nodes)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full server compromise, potential for lateral movement)
*   **Effort:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*   **Skill Level:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard (Can be very stealthy)

## Attack Tree Path: [Super User Access [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/super_user_access__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** Obtaining super user credentials grants the attacker extensive control over the Matomo instance, including the ability to install plugins, modify configurations, and potentially achieve RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** (Dependent on the success of sub-nodes)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Near-complete control of Matomo)
*   **Effort:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*   **Skill Level:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** (Dependent on the chosen attack path)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data - Plugin Vulnerabilities [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_-_plugin_vulnerabilities__hr_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data - Configuration Misconfigurations [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_-_configuration_misconfigurations__hr_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low to Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data - Tracking API Abuse [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data_-_tracking_api_abuse__hr_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting an improperly secured tracking API to inject malicious JavaScript (leading to XSS on *tracked* websites) or to flood the API with fake data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (affects users of tracked websites)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve RCE - Plugin Vulnerabilities [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_rce_-_plugin_vulnerabilities__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like file inclusion, insecure deserialization, or command injection within a plugin to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Super User Access - Phishing [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/super_user_access_-_phishing__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Tricking a Matomo super user into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails or websites.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
