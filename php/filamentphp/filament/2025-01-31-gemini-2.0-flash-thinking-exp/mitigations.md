## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Filament Panels](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__for_filament_panels.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Filament Panels
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose and Integrate MFA Provider:** Select a Laravel-compatible MFA provider and integrate it into your Filament application's authentication flow. This typically involves modifying the Filament login process to include an MFA step after password authentication.
    2.  **Implement MFA Setup in Filament:** Create a user interface within the Filament admin panel (e.g., a settings page) where users can enroll in MFA, linking their chosen MFA method (e.g., authenticator app, SMS).
    3.  **Enforce MFA for Filament Users:** Configure Filament's authentication guard or middleware to enforce MFA for all or specific roles accessing the Filament panel. Ensure that users are redirected to the MFA setup page if they haven't enrolled.
    4.  **Securely Store MFA Secrets:** Store MFA secrets (e.g., keys, recovery codes) securely, ideally encrypted in the database.
    5.  **User Education:** Provide clear instructions to Filament users on how to set up and use MFA for accessing the admin panel.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):**  Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the Filament admin panel if user passwords are compromised.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Makes brute-force attacks against Filament login pages much less effective as attackers need more than just a password.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic password authentication using Laravel's default auth system is in place for Filament.
*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA is not currently enabled for Filament users. Integration with an MFA provider, MFA setup UI within Filament, and enforcement policies are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Filament Policies and Gates](./mitigation_strategies/implement_granular_role-based_access_control__rbac__using_filament_policies_and_gates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Filament Features
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles and Permissions:** Clearly define user roles relevant to Filament access (e.g., Admin, Editor, Reviewer) and the specific permissions associated with each role within the Filament context (e.g., access to specific resources, actions, pages).
    2.  **Utilize Filament Policies:** Create Laravel policies to define authorization logic for Filament resources (models). Policies should determine which users with specific roles can perform actions (view, create, update, delete) on each resource.
    3.  **Implement Filament Gates:** Use Filament gates to control access to specific Filament pages, actions, and UI elements based on user roles and permissions. Gates provide a way to define authorization rules outside of policies, often for non-model related access control.
    4.  **Assign Roles to Filament Users:** Implement a system to assign roles to users who access the Filament panel. This could be a simple role column in the user table or a more complex roles and permissions management system.
    5.  **Test and Audit Authorization Rules:** Thoroughly test all Filament policies and gates to ensure they correctly enforce the intended access control. Regularly audit and update these rules as application requirements change.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access within Filament (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing or modifying Filament resources, pages, or actions they are not authorized to use based on their role.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Filament (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users gaining access to higher privilege levels or functionalities within the Filament admin panel than intended.
    *   **Data Breaches via Filament (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage from compromised Filament accounts by restricting access to sensitive data and actions based on roles.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access within Filament:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Filament:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches via Filament:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic authorization using Filament policies is implemented for some core models, but it's not consistently applied across all Filament resources and actions.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular permission definitions for each role are not fully defined within the Filament context. RBAC is not consistently enforced across all Filament features, custom pages, and actions. A comprehensive role management system integrated with Filament is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in Filament Forms and Actions](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_in_filament_forms_and_actions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in Filament
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Comprehensive Validation Rules in Filament Forms:** For every field in Filament forms, define robust server-side validation rules using Filament's form builder and Laravel's validation system.  Focus on validating data type, format, length, allowed values, and required fields relevant to the specific context of each form field within Filament.
    2.  **Implement Server-Side Validation Enforcement:** Ensure that all validation rules defined in Filament forms are strictly enforced on the server-side. Client-side validation should be considered only as a user experience enhancement, not a security measure.
    3.  **Sanitize User Inputs Displayed in Filament:** When displaying user-provided data within the Filament UI (e.g., in lists, forms, notifications), use appropriate sanitization techniques to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Leverage Blade templating's automatic escaping (`{{ }}`) for general text content. For rich text editor content, use a dedicated HTML sanitization library to remove potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes.
    4.  **Secure File Uploads via Filament Forms:** When handling file uploads through Filament forms, implement strict security measures:
        *   Use Filament's file upload components with validation rules to restrict allowed file types (MIME types and extensions) and file sizes.
        *   Store uploaded files securely outside the web root.
        *   Consider implementing virus scanning on files uploaded through Filament forms.
    5.  **Validate Inputs in Filament Actions:**  If using custom Filament actions that accept user input, ensure that these inputs are also rigorously validated and sanitized using the same principles as form inputs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filament Forms (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious scripts into the Filament admin panel through user inputs in forms and actions.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues via Filament Forms (Medium Severity):** Ensures that data entered and processed through Filament forms is valid, consistent, and conforms to expected formats, maintaining data integrity within the application.
    *   **File Upload Vulnerabilities via Filament (Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious file uploads through Filament forms that could lead to code execution, data breaches, or other security issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filament Forms:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Integrity Issues via Filament Forms:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **File Upload Vulnerabilities via Filament:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic validation rules are used in some Filament forms, but they are not consistently applied across all forms and fields. Sanitization is generally handled by Blade templating for basic text, but explicit sanitization for rich text content and file uploads within Filament might be missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive and consistent validation rules for all Filament forms and actions are needed. Explicit sanitization for all user inputs displayed in Filament, especially rich text content and file uploads, needs to be implemented. Robust file upload security measures within Filament forms are not fully in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden Filament Configuration (`config/filament.php`)](./mitigation_strategies/harden_filament_configuration___configfilament_php__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Harden Filament Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Change Default Filament Path:** Modify the `filament.path` configuration in `config/filament.php` to a less predictable and harder-to-guess value. This makes it slightly more difficult for attackers to discover the Filament admin panel URL.
    2.  **Disable Unused Filament Panels:** If your application uses multiple Filament panels, disable or remove any panels that are not actively used to reduce the attack surface.
    3.  **Review and Secure Other Filament Configuration Options:** Carefully review all other configuration options in `config/filament.php` and adjust them according to security best practices and your application's specific needs. Pay attention to options related to authentication, branding, and feature availability.
    4.  **Secure Environment Variables:** Ensure that environment variables used by Filament, especially database credentials and API keys, are securely managed and not exposed in publicly accessible files or logs. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in `config/filament.php` or other configuration files.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Hiding the default Filament path makes it slightly harder for attackers to locate the admin panel.
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Low Severity):** Disabling unused panels reduces the potential attack surface by removing unnecessary entry points.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Low Risk Reduction
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Default `filament.path` might still be in use. Unused panels might not be disabled.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  `filament.path` needs to be changed to a non-default value. Review and disable unused Filament panels. Security review of all `config/filament.php` options is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Filament and Plugin Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_filament_and_plugin_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Filament and Plugin Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Filament Releases and Security Advisories:** Regularly check the official Filament website, GitHub repository, and community channels for new releases, security advisories, and bug fixes.
    2.  **Update Filament Core:** Keep Filament itself updated to the latest stable version. New versions often include security patches and bug fixes that address known vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Update Filament Plugins:** If using third-party Filament plugins, regularly check for updates and apply them promptly. Plugins can also contain vulnerabilities, and updates often include security fixes.
    4.  **Test Updates in a Staging Environment:** Before applying Filament core or plugin updates to the production environment, thoroughly test them in a staging or development environment to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Filament Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Filament core or plugins that have been addressed in newer versions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Filament Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Developers are generally aware of the need for updates, but a formal process for regular monitoring and prompt application of Filament and plugin updates is not fully established.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A formal process for monitoring Filament and plugin updates is needed. A dedicated staging environment for testing Filament updates before production deployment is not consistently used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Development of Custom Filament Components, Actions, and Pages](./mitigation_strategies/secure_development_of_custom_filament_components__actions__and_pages.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Development Practices for Custom Filament Code
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Follow Secure Coding Principles:** When developing custom Filament components, actions, pages, or logic, adhere to secure coding principles to prevent common web vulnerabilities. Be particularly mindful of injection flaws (SQL injection, command injection, etc.) and insecure data handling.
    2.  **Input Validation and Output Encoding in Custom Code:** Apply strict input validation and output encoding within custom Filament code, mirroring the validation and sanitization strategies used in Filament forms. Validate all user inputs accepted by custom components and sanitize outputs displayed in custom UI elements.
    3.  **Secure Database Interactions in Custom Code:** When writing custom database queries within Filament components or actions, use parameterized queries or the Eloquent ORM to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Avoid raw SQL queries unless absolutely necessary and handle them with extreme care.
    4.  **Implement Proper Error Handling and Logging in Custom Filament Code:** Include robust error handling and logging in custom Filament code to aid in debugging and security monitoring. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages displayed in the Filament UI or in logs.
    5.  **Security Code Reviews for Custom Filament Code:** Conduct security-focused code reviews for all custom Filament components, actions, and pages before deployment. Have another developer or security expert review the code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    6.  **Security Testing of Custom Filament Code:** Perform security testing, such as static analysis or dynamic analysis, specifically targeting custom Filament components and functionalities to identify potential vulnerabilities that might not be apparent through code reviews alone.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Filament Code (High Severity):** Prevents SQL injection, command injection, and other injection flaws introduced in custom Filament code.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Filament Components (High Severity):** Prevents XSS vulnerabilities arising from custom Filament components that handle user input or display dynamic content.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Custom Filament Code (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches resulting from vulnerabilities in custom Filament code that mishandles sensitive data or provides unauthorized access.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Custom Filament Code (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental information disclosure through error messages, insecure logging, or vulnerabilities in custom Filament components.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Filament Code:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Filament Components:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches due to Custom Filament Code:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Information Disclosure via Custom Filament Code:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Developers are generally aware of secure coding principles, but formal security code reviews and dedicated security testing are not consistently performed for custom Filament components.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal secure coding guidelines specific to Filament development are not documented. A mandatory security code review process for custom Filament code is missing. Security testing specifically targeting custom Filament components is not routinely performed.
