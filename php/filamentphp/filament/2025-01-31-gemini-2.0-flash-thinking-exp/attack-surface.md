# Attack Surface Analysis for filamentphp/filament

## Attack Surface: [Default Authentication Routes and Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/default_authentication_routes_and_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of standard login and authentication paths, making them easily discoverable by attackers.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament *automatically sets up* `/admin/login`, `/admin/register`, `/admin/password/reset` routes. Using these defaults increases predictability and simplifies attacker reconnaissance.
*   **Example:** An attacker attempts brute-force attacks on `/admin/login` to guess admin credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the admin panel, data breaches, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Customize the default admin panel path (e.g., `/secret-admin-panel`) using Filament configuration.
    *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts using Laravel's features or packages, specifically for the Filament login route.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for Filament users.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Filament logins, leveraging Filament's authentication customization options.

## Attack Surface: [Filament User Roles and Permissions Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/filament_user_roles_and_permissions_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured or overly permissive roles and permissions within *Filament's authorization system*.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament *provides a flexible permission system*, but its security relies entirely on correct developer implementation. Misconfiguration within Filament's permission system directly leads to vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A developer incorrectly assigns a role that grants unintended access to sensitive Filament resources or actions.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation within the Filament admin panel, unauthorized data modification or deletion, access to sensitive functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully define granular roles and permissions *within Filament's permission system* based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit and review role and permission configurations *specifically within Filament*.
    *   Utilize Filament's policy generators and ensure policies are correctly implemented for all Filament resources and actions.
    *   Test Filament permissions thoroughly after any changes to role or policy configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in Filament Resources](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_filament_resources.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Eloquent mass assignment vulnerabilities through *Filament forms* to modify unintended model attributes.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament resources are built on Eloquent models and *directly use forms to interact with these models*.  If models are not protected against mass assignment, Filament forms become the attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `is_admin` attribute of a user model to `true` by including it in a form submission through a Filament resource, gaining administrative privileges within Filament.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption within Filament managed data, privilege escalation within the admin panel, bypassing business logic enforced through Filament.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly define `$fillable` or `$guarded` attributes in Eloquent models *used by Filament resources*.
    *   Validate all user inputs within *Filament forms and actions*, even when using `$fillable` or `$guarded`, to ensure data integrity within Filament.
    *   Avoid directly binding user input to model attributes without validation and sanitization in Filament resource logic.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Resource URLs](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_resource_urls.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to resources by manipulating IDs in *Filament resource URLs* due to insufficient authorization checks.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament *resource URLs inherently expose record IDs* as part of its routing structure. This design makes IDOR vulnerabilities directly relevant if Filament's authorization mechanisms are not properly applied.
*   **Example:** An attacker changes the ID in a Filament resource URL to access or modify a record belonging to another user, bypassing intended access controls *within the Filament admin panel*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion *within Filament managed data*; data breaches exposed through Filament; privacy violations within the admin panel.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always enforce authorization checks within *Filament resource controllers, policies, and actions* based on the authenticated Filament user and the requested resource.
    *   Never rely on URL obscurity for security in Filament resource URLs.
    *   Use *Filament's authorization features* to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Filament Forms and Widgets](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_filament_forms_and_widgets.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into *Filament forms or widgets* that are then executed in users' browsers.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament *forms and widgets render user-supplied data*. If developers don't sanitize data within Filament components, XSS vulnerabilities are directly introduced through Filament's UI.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects JavaScript code into a text field in a Filament form. When another user views or edits this record *within Filament*, the script executes in their browser.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking of Filament admin users, account takeover within the admin panel, data theft from within Filament interfaces, defacement of Filament pages, malware distribution to Filament users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and escape user inputs when rendering them in *Filament forms and widgets*.
    *   Utilize *Filament's form field types and validation rules* to minimize injection risks.
    *   Be particularly cautious with HTML fields and custom form components *within Filament*.
    *   Use templating engines (like Blade in Laravel) that automatically escape output by default, ensuring this applies to all data rendered in Filament.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks within the Filament admin panel.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Action and Widget Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/custom_action_and_widget_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Introduction of code injection vulnerabilities through *custom Filament actions or widgets* that execute dynamic code based on user input.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament's extensibility *allows for custom actions and widgets*.  Poorly implemented custom components within Filament are a direct source of code injection risks.
*   **Example:** A custom Filament action executes a shell command constructed using unsanitized user input provided through the Filament interface, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) originating from the Filament admin panel, complete system compromise accessible through Filament, data breaches initiated via Filament.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid executing dynamic code based on user input in *custom Filament actions and widgets*.
    *   If dynamic code execution is absolutely necessary in custom Filament components, carefully sanitize and validate all inputs.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from custom Filament code.
    *   Follow secure coding practices specifically when developing *custom Filament components*.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of *all custom Filament components*.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Allowing users to upload files without proper restrictions *through Filament forms*, leading to various file-related vulnerabilities.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament *forms often include file upload fields*.  If file upload handling in Filament is not secured, it becomes a direct entry point for file-based attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image file through a Filament form, which is then accessible and executable on the server, potentially leading to system compromise via Filament.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution initiated through file uploads via Filament, system compromise starting from Filament, data breaches facilitated by file uploads through Filament.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation using an allowlist approach *within Filament's file upload handling* (e.g., only allow specific image types).
    *   Limit file sizes to prevent denial of service and storage exhaustion *related to Filament file uploads*.
    *   Store uploaded files outside of the web root to prevent direct execution, ensuring this applies to files uploaded via Filament.
    *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks and other issues *related to Filament file uploads*.
    *   Consider using a dedicated file storage service with built-in security features for files uploaded through Filament.
    *   Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software, especially for files uploaded via Filament.
