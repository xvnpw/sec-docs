# Attack Surface Analysis for filamentphp/filament

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Resource Policies](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_resource_policies.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access or modification of data managed by Filament resources due to flaws in authorization logic.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament's reliance on policies defined for Eloquent models to control access makes misconfigured or overly permissive policies a direct contributor to this vulnerability.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in Resources](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_resources.md)

**Description:** Attackers can modify unintended database fields by manipulating request parameters when creating or updating resources.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament's form handling, if not properly secured with `$fillable` or `$guarded` in the Eloquent model, directly enables mass assignment.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized data modification.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Form Inputs](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_form_inputs.md)

**Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into web pages through user-provided data in Filament forms, targeting other users.

**How Filament Contributes:** If data submitted through Filament forms is not properly sanitized before being displayed within the Filament admin panel, it directly leads to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of the admin panel, redirection to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Custom Queries/Filters](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_custom_queriesfilters.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through user-controlled input.

**How Filament Contributes:** When developers write custom database queries or filters within Filament resources or actions without proper sanitization or parameterization of user input, it directly introduces SQL injection risks.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection through Custom Actions/Form Fields](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_through_custom_actionsform_fields.md)

**Description:** Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the server by injecting malicious commands through user input.

**How Filament Contributes:** If custom Filament actions or form fields execute system commands based on user input without proper sanitization, Filament's extensibility directly facilitates command injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data loss, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers can upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to code execution or other security breaches.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament's form fields for file uploads, if not properly configured and validated within the Filament resource or custom action, directly contribute to this vulnerability.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Widget Implementations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_widget_implementations.md)

**Description:** Custom Filament widgets might introduce vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.

**How Filament Contributes:** The ability to create custom widgets within Filament means that insecure code within these widgets directly impacts the security of the admin panel.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, XSS, potential for other vulnerabilities depending on the widget's functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins/Packages](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_pluginspackages.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in plugins or packages used with Filament can introduce vulnerabilities into the application.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament's architecture encourages the use of third-party plugins, making the application's security dependent on the security of these external components.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability in the plugin)
