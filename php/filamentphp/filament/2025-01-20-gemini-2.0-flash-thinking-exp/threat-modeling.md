# Threat Model Analysis for filamentphp/filament

## Threat: [Bypassing Filament Resource Policies](./threats/bypassing_filament_resource_policies.md)

**Description:** An attacker might find vulnerabilities in how Filament enforces resource policies, allowing them to perform actions (create, read, update, delete) on resources they should not have access to. This could involve manipulating requests or exploiting flaws in the policy evaluation logic within Filament.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access and modification of sensitive data managed by Filament resources. This could lead to data breaches, corruption, or unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of legitimate users.

**Affected Filament Component:** Resource system, Policy enforcement layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test and audit all Filament resource policies.
*   Ensure policies are correctly defined and enforced by Filament's authorization mechanisms.
*   Stay updated with Filament releases that address potential policy bypass vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Role Manipulation](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_role_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited access might exploit vulnerabilities in Filament's role management system to grant themselves higher privileges or assign themselves to more powerful roles within the Filament admin panel. This could allow them to bypass access controls and perform actions beyond their intended scope.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive features and data within the Filament admin panel, potentially leading to full administrative control.

**Affected Filament Component:** User Management module, Role and Permission management features.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust validation and authorization checks within Filament when assigning or modifying user roles.
*   Restrict access to Filament's role management features to only highly trusted administrators.
*   Regularly audit user roles and permissions within the Filament admin panel.

## Threat: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Form Builder](./threats/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__through_form_builder.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into form fields managed by Filament's Form Builder. This script would be stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected record within the Filament admin panel, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the victim within the Filament interface.

**Impact:** Compromise of administrator accounts, data theft, and potential further attacks on other users of the Filament admin panel.

**Affected Filament Component:** Form Builder - Text Input, Textarea, and potentially other input components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement server-side input validation and sanitization for all form fields handled by Filament.
*   Utilize Filament's validation rules and consider using HTMLPurifier or similar libraries for sanitization before storing data processed by Filament forms.
*   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks within the Filament admin panel.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of File Uploads in Filament](./threats/insecure_handling_of_file_uploads_in_filament.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload malicious files through Filament's file upload components if proper validation and sanitization are not implemented within Filament's file handling logic. This could lead to remote code execution if the uploaded file is processed by the server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Affected Filament Component:** Form Builder - File Upload component, Media Library integration (if used within Filament).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the extension within Filament's file upload handling.
*   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities when handling uploads through Filament.
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a controller with appropriate access controls, ensuring Filament's file serving mechanisms are secure.
*   Consider using a dedicated file storage service with security features when integrating with Filament's file upload capabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through External Integrations](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__through_external_integrations.md)

**Description:** If Filament's custom actions or form fields are designed to fetch data from external URLs, an attacker could potentially manipulate these integrations to make requests to internal resources or other external services that they should not have access to. This vulnerability lies within how Filament allows developers to integrate with external resources.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches from other services, and denial-of-service attacks on internal infrastructure.

**Affected Filament Component:** Custom Actions, Form Builder components that interact with external APIs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs used in external integrations within Filament's custom components.
*   Use allow lists for allowed external domains when configuring Filament's external integrations.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided input in external requests initiated by Filament components.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Filament Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_filament_plugins.md)

**Description:** If the application uses third-party Filament plugins, these plugins might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, directly impacting the security of the Filament admin panel.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the plugin, ranging from data breaches to remote code execution within the context of the Filament application.

**Affected Filament Component:** Plugin system, specific plugin components.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only install Filament plugins from trusted sources.
*   Keep Filament plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Review the code of Filament plugins before installation if possible.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Debug Mode](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_debug_mode.md)

**Description:** If the Filament application is deployed with debug mode enabled, detailed error messages and stack traces within the Filament admin panel might be exposed, revealing sensitive information about the application's internal workings to potential attackers.

**Impact:** Information disclosure that could aid attackers in identifying vulnerabilities and planning attacks against the Filament application.

**Affected Filament Component:** Application configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (While the impact is information disclosure, it can significantly aid in exploiting other vulnerabilities, making it a high concern in a security context).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure debug mode is disabled in production environments where the Filament admin panel is accessible.
*   Configure proper error logging and reporting mechanisms for the Filament application.
