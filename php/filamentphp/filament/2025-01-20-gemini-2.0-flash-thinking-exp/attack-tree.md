## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploiting weaknesses in custom authentication code (e.g., logic flaws, insecure password hashing, missing checks).
    *   Bypassing authentication middleware or guards through manipulation of request parameters or headers.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party authentication libraries if used.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL] Bypass Authentication Logic](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__critical__bypass_authentication_logic.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploiting flaws in the application's custom authentication implementation, such as incorrect conditional logic or missing security checks.
    *   Leveraging vulnerabilities in how the application integrates with external authentication providers.
    *   Circumventing authentication mechanisms through techniques like parameter tampering or header manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Authorization Logic](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_authorization_logic.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploiting flaws in how user roles and permissions are defined and enforced within the Filament application.
    *   Bypassing authorization checks by manipulating user session data or request parameters.
    *   Leveraging vulnerabilities in custom authorization logic or policy implementations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Elevate Privileges by Manipulating Roles/Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__elevate_privileges_by_manipulating_rolespermissions.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Directly modifying user roles or permissions in the database if the Filament interface or backend logic is vulnerable.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the user management interface to assign higher privileges to an attacker's account.
    *   Leveraging insecure API endpoints related to user management to escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Submitting malicious input through Filament forms that is not properly sanitized or validated.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Filament handles data rendering in tables or other components.
    *   Manipulating data passed to Filament actions or bulk actions to perform unauthorized operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL] Form Input Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__critical__form_input_manipulation.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Crafting malicious input strings designed to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries.
    *   Injecting JavaScript code into form fields that will be executed in other users' browsers (XSS).
    *   Submitting unexpected data in form requests to modify model attributes that are not intended to be user-controlled (Mass Assignment).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] SQL Injection via Form Inputs](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__sql_injection_via_form_inputs.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Injecting SQL keywords and operators into form fields to manipulate database queries, allowing access to or modification of sensitive data.
    *   Using techniques like UNION-based injection, boolean-based blind injection, or time-based blind injection to extract data.
    *   Potentially gaining command execution on the database server in some scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Form Inputs](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__critical__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_form_inputs.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Injecting `<script>` tags or other HTML elements containing malicious JavaScript into form fields.
    *   Crafting input that, when displayed, executes JavaScript to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Stored XSS](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__stored_xss.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Persistently injecting malicious scripts into the application's database through form inputs.
    *   The injected script is then executed whenever the stored data is displayed to other users, potentially leading to widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Code Injection Points](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_code_injection_points.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Injecting malicious code into areas where it can be interpreted and executed by the server or client.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in template engines or custom components that allow for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Blade Template Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__blade_template_injection.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Injecting malicious Blade directives or PHP code into user-controlled data that is then rendered by the Blade templating engine.
    *   Achieving remote code execution on the server by exploiting insecure use of Blade features.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Custom Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__custom_component_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploiting security flaws in custom Filament components developed for the application, such as input validation issues, insecure data handling, or logic errors.
    *   The specific attack vectors depend on the functionality and implementation of the custom component. This could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
