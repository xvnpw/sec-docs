## Deep Analysis of SQL Injection through Custom Queries/Filters in Filament Applications

As a cybersecurity expert collaborating with the development team, this document provides a deep analysis of the SQL Injection attack surface within Filament applications, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities arising from custom queries and filters.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to thoroughly examine the potential for SQL Injection vulnerabilities within Filament applications stemming from the use of custom database queries and filters. This includes identifying common pitfalls, understanding the mechanisms of exploitation, and providing actionable recommendations for mitigation. We aim to equip the development team with the knowledge and best practices necessary to prevent this critical vulnerability.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects related to SQL Injection through custom queries and filters in Filament applications:

* **Custom Queries within Filament Resources:**  This includes queries defined within Eloquent models, resource definitions (e.g., `getEloquentQuery()`, custom scopes), and custom actions.
* **Custom Filters in Filament Tables and Lists:** This encompasses filters implemented using closures or custom filter classes where user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries.
* **Developer-Written Code:** The analysis primarily targets vulnerabilities introduced by developers when implementing custom database interactions, rather than inherent vulnerabilities within the Filament framework itself (assuming the framework is used as intended).
* **User-Controlled Input:** We will examine how various forms of user input (e.g., text fields, select boxes, date pickers) can be exploited to inject malicious SQL code.

**Out of Scope:**

* **Core Filament Framework Vulnerabilities:** We assume the core Filament framework is secure and up-to-date. This analysis focuses on how developers might misuse or extend the framework in a way that introduces vulnerabilities.
* **Other Attack Vectors:** This analysis is specifically focused on SQL Injection. Other potential attack surfaces within Filament applications (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)) are outside the scope of this document.
* **Specific Database Systems:** While the principles of SQL Injection are generally applicable, this analysis will not delve into database-specific syntax or vulnerabilities.

### 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be employed for this deep analysis:

* **Code Review Guidelines:** Establish guidelines for reviewing code related to custom queries and filters, focusing on identifying areas where user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
* **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential threat actors, their motivations, and the attack vectors they might employ to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the context of Filament applications.
* **Common Vulnerability Pattern Analysis:**  Analyze common patterns and anti-patterns in code that lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities, specifically within the Filament ecosystem. This includes examining how developers might interact with Eloquent and the query builder.
* **Attack Simulation (Conceptual):**  Develop conceptual examples of how an attacker could craft malicious SQL payloads to exploit identified vulnerabilities. This will help illustrate the potential impact and severity.
* **Best Practices and Mitigation Strategies:**  Document and recommend best practices for preventing SQL Injection, tailored to the Filament framework and common development patterns. This includes emphasizing the use of parameterized queries and input validation.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: SQL Injection through Custom Queries/Filters

This section delves into the specifics of the SQL Injection attack surface within Filament applications, focusing on custom queries and filters.

**4.1 Entry Points and Vulnerable Code Locations:**

The primary entry points for SQL Injection in this context are any user-controlled inputs that are directly incorporated into custom SQL queries or filter conditions. This can occur in various parts of a Filament application:

* **Resource Definitions:**
    * **`getEloquentQuery()` method:** If developers modify this method to include raw SQL or concatenate user input into the query without proper parameterization.
    * **Custom Scopes:** When custom Eloquent scopes are defined and user input is used to build dynamic `where` clauses without using the query builder's parameter binding features.
    * **Custom Actions:**  If actions perform database operations using raw SQL or build queries dynamically based on user input without proper sanitization.
* **Table and List Filters:**
    * **Closure-based Filters:** When using closure-based filters, developers might directly incorporate user input into the `where` clause of the query.
    * **Custom Filter Classes:** If the `apply()` method of a custom filter class constructs SQL queries by concatenating user input.
* **Custom Widgets and Pages:**  If these components perform database queries based on user input received through forms or other means, and the queries are not constructed securely.
* **Relationship Filters:** While Filament provides mechanisms for filtering relationships, developers might introduce vulnerabilities if they implement custom logic that involves raw SQL or insecure query building.

**Example Vulnerable Code Snippets (Illustrative):**

```php
// Vulnerable custom scope in a model
public function scopeSearchName($query, $name)
{
    // DO NOT DO THIS - Vulnerable to SQL Injection
    return $query->whereRaw("name LIKE '%" . $name . "%'");
}

// Vulnerable filter in a Filament resource
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    $search = request('search');
    // DO NOT DO THIS - Vulnerable to SQL Injection
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()->whereRaw("name LIKE '%" . $search . "%'");
}

// Vulnerable custom action
public function handle(array $data): void
{
    $userId = $data['user_id'];
    $role = $data['role'];
    // DO NOT DO THIS - Vulnerable to SQL Injection
    DB::statement("UPDATE users SET role = '$role' WHERE id = $userId");
}

// Vulnerable closure-based filter
Tables\Filters\Filter::make('search_by_name')
    ->form([
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name'),
    ])
    ->query(function (Builder $query, array $data): Builder {
        if ($data['name']) {
            // DO NOT DO THIS - Vulnerable to SQL Injection
            $query->whereRaw("name LIKE '%" . $data['name'] . "%'");
        }
        return $query;
    }),
```

**4.2 Attack Vectors and Exploitation Techniques:**

Attackers can leverage various SQL Injection techniques to exploit these vulnerabilities:

* **Classic SQL Injection:** Injecting malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the query's logic. Examples include:
    * `' OR '1'='1` (Always true condition to bypass authentication or retrieve all data)
    * `'; DROP TABLE users; --` (To drop tables)
    * `'; UPDATE products SET price = 0 WHERE id = 1; --` (To modify data)
* **UNION-based SQL Injection:** Using `UNION` clauses to retrieve data from other tables or databases.
* **Boolean-based Blind SQL Injection:** Inferring information about the database structure and data by observing the application's response to different injected payloads that result in true or false conditions.
* **Time-based Blind SQL Injection:**  Using database functions like `SLEEP()` or `BENCHMARK()` to introduce delays and infer information based on the response time.
* **Second-Order SQL Injection:**  Injecting malicious code that is stored in the database and later executed when retrieved and used in another query.

**Example Attack Payloads:**

* **In a search field:** `admin' --` (Comment out the rest of the query)
* **In a filter input:** `test' OR 1=1 --` (Retrieve all records)
* **In a user ID field (in a vulnerable action):** `1; DELETE FROM users WHERE role = 'guest'; --` (Execute multiple queries)

**4.3 Underlying Causes:**

The root cause of SQL Injection vulnerabilities in custom queries and filters is the failure to properly sanitize or parameterize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries. This typically stems from:

* **Direct String Concatenation:**  Developers directly concatenating user input into SQL query strings, making it easy for attackers to inject malicious code.
* **Misunderstanding of ORM/Query Builder Security:**  While Eloquent and the query builder offer protection against SQL Injection when used correctly, developers might bypass these protections by using raw SQL methods (`whereRaw`, `DB::statement`) without proper parameter binding.
* **Lack of Input Validation:**  Insufficient or absent validation of user input allows attackers to submit unexpected or malicious data.
* **Trusting User Input:**  Treating user input as safe without proper sanitization or escaping.
* **Insufficient Security Awareness:**  Lack of understanding of SQL Injection risks and secure coding practices among developers.

**4.4 Filament-Specific Considerations:**

* **Eloquent's Power and Potential Pitfalls:** While Eloquent provides a secure way to interact with the database, developers need to be cautious when using raw SQL or dynamically building queries.
* **Custom Actions and Filters:** These are common areas where developers might introduce vulnerabilities if they are not careful about handling user input.
* **Blade Templating:** While Blade itself doesn't directly cause SQL Injection, it's important to ensure that data displayed in Blade templates is properly escaped to prevent other vulnerabilities like XSS.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

To effectively mitigate the risk of SQL Injection through custom queries and filters in Filament applications, the following strategies are recommended:

* **Prioritize Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective defense against SQL Injection. Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when incorporating user input into SQL queries. Eloquent's query builder methods (e.g., `where()`, `orWhere()`, `orderBy()`) automatically handle parameter binding.

    ```php
    // Secure example using Eloquent's query builder
    public function scopeSearchName($query, $name)
    {
        return $query->where('name', 'like', '%' . $name . '%');
    }

    // Secure example using parameter binding in raw SQL
    DB::statement("UPDATE users SET role = ? WHERE id = ?", [$role, $userId]);
    ```

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** While not a primary defense against SQL Injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help prevent other issues and reduce the attack surface.
    * **Validate Data Types:** Ensure that input matches the expected data type (e.g., integer, email).
    * **Whitelist Allowed Values:** If possible, restrict input to a predefined set of valid values (e.g., using select boxes or radio buttons).
    * **Escape Special Characters:**  While parameterization is preferred, if absolutely necessary to use raw SQL, properly escape special characters using database-specific escaping functions (though this is generally discouraged).

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its tasks. This limits the potential damage if an SQL Injection attack is successful.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where custom queries and filters are implemented. Use static analysis tools to help identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **Utilize Filament's Built-in Features:** Leverage Filament's built-in features for filtering and searching whenever possible, as these are generally implemented securely.

* **Educate Developers:** Provide developers with training on SQL Injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices. Emphasize the importance of parameterization and the risks of using raw SQL without proper precautions.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing SQL Injection, a well-configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of certain types of attacks that might be chained with SQL Injection.

### 6. Conclusion
