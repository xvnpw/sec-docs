# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for filamentphp/filament

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Define Filament Policies](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_define_filament_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all Filament Resources and Actions:** List all resources (e.g., Users, Posts, Products) and actions (e.g., Create, Edit, Delete, View) within your Filament admin panel.
    2.  **Generate Policy Classes:** For each resource, use Filament's policy generator command (`php artisan filament:policy ResourceName`) to create a dedicated policy class in your `app/Policies` directory.
    3.  **Define Explicit Policy Methods:** Within each policy class, implement methods like `viewAny`, `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, and any custom actions you have defined.  These methods should contain the logic to determine if a user is authorized to perform the action on the resource, leveraging Filament's authorization context.
    4.  **Avoid Implicit Authorization:**  Do not rely on Filament's default implicit authorization (e.g., assuming `viewAny` is always allowed). Explicitly define authorization rules for every action, even if it's to deny access within Filament's policy structure.
    5.  **Register Policies:** Ensure your policies are registered in your `AuthServiceProvider` or Filament's policy registration within your resource classes, making them active within Filament.
    6.  **Thorough Testing:**  Write unit tests and perform manual testing to verify that your policies correctly enforce the intended access control for different user roles and scenarios *within the Filament admin panel*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Resources (High Severity): Attackers or unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive data or functionalities *within the Filament admin panel*.
    *   Data Breaches (High Severity): Unauthorized access leading to the exposure, modification, or deletion of sensitive data managed through Filament.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Lower-privileged users exploiting misconfigurations to gain access to higher-level administrative functions *within Filament*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Resources: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Breaches: High Risk Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Policies are currently implemented for `UserResource` and `BlogPostResource` located in `app/Policies` directory. These policies are registered in `AuthServiceProvider.php`. Basic tests are in place for `UserPolicy`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Policies are missing for `ProductResource`, `OrderResource`, and `CustomerResource`.  No policies are defined for custom Filament actions yet.  More comprehensive testing is needed for existing policies, including edge cases and different user roles *within Filament*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit Filament Policies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_filament_policies.md)
