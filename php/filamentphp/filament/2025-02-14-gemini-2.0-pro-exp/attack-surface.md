# Attack Surface Analysis for filamentphp/filament

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass in Resources](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_in_resources.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to data or actions within Filament resources due to misconfigured or bypassed authorization logic.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament's resource-based structure and its reliance on Laravel's authorization (Policies, Gates) create a *centralized and Filament-specific* point for authorization configuration. Errors *directly* within Filament resource definitions impact access control. This is not a general Laravel issue; it's how Filament *uses* Laravel's features.
*   **Example:** A `canView` method in a Filament resource policy incorrectly checks a user's role, allowing users with the wrong role to view sensitive data. This is a direct misconfiguration *within* the Filament resource definition.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification/deletion, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Filament-Specific Policy Review:** Meticulously review and test *all* `can()` methods *within* Filament resource policies. Focus on the logic *specific to the Filament resource*.
    *   **Filament-Specific Policy Testing:** Use Laravel's policy testing, but focus on testing scenarios *through the lens of Filament's resource access*. Simulate different user roles interacting with Filament's UI and API.
    *   **Relationship Authorization (Filament Context):** Explicitly check authorization for relationship access and manipulation *within Filament's relationship management features*. This is a Filament-specific concern.
    *   **Global Scope Auditing (Filament Usage):** Review global scopes, paying particular attention to how they interact with *Filament's resource filtering and display*.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (Filament Components)](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities__filament_components_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of weaknesses in Filament's *built-in* file upload components, allowing attackers to upload malicious files.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament provides *specific* file upload components (e.g., `FileUpload`) and handles the initial file upload process. Misconfiguration or lack of validation *within these Filament components* creates a direct attack vector. This is distinct from general Laravel file handling.
*   **Example:** A Filament `FileUpload` component is configured to allow `.php` files, and these files are stored in a publicly accessible directory. This is a direct misconfiguration of a *Filament-provided component*.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), complete server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Filament Component Configuration:**  Strictly configure Filament's `FileUpload` component (and related components) to restrict file types, sizes, and storage locations. Use the component's built-in validation options.
    *   **Server-Side Validation (Filament Context):**  Implement server-side validation *specifically for files uploaded through Filament components*, even if the component has client-side validation.
    *   **Secure Storage (Filament Integration):** Ensure that files uploaded *via Filament* are stored outside the web root and served indirectly through a controller, leveraging Filament's integration with Laravel's file system.
    *   **File Scanning (Filament Workflow):** Integrate file scanning into the *Filament upload workflow* to detect malicious content before it's stored.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Actions/Components](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_actionscomponents.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws introduced within custom Filament actions, components, or widgets developed by the application team.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament's extensibility *encourages* developers to create custom code that *tightly integrates* with the framework. This custom code, *because it's part of the Filament ecosystem*, is a prime location for vulnerabilities. This is a direct consequence of using Filament's extension points.
*   **Example:** A custom Filament action that takes user input from a Filament form field and uses it to construct a database query without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection. This vulnerability exists *because of the custom Filament action*.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely, potentially including data breaches, RCE, and other severe consequences.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding (Filament Context):** Follow secure coding practices *specifically when developing custom Filament elements*. Be aware of how Filament handles data and user input.
    *   **Input Validation (Filament Forms):** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* user input that comes from Filament forms or is used within custom Filament logic.
    *   **Avoid `eval()` (Filament Extensions):** Never use `eval()` or similar functions within custom Filament code.
    *   **Code Reviews (Filament Expertise):** Conduct code reviews with a focus on how the custom code interacts with *Filament's APIs and data handling*.
    *   **Static Analysis (Filament Integration):** Use static analysis tools, and consider tools that understand Laravel and Filament's structure.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**  Security flaws within third-party Filament plugins installed in the application.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament's plugin ecosystem allows extending functionality, but introduces the risk of using insecure plugins that are directly integrated into the Filament admin panel.
*   **Example:**  A third-party Filament plugin for integrating with a payment gateway has a vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass payment processing. The vulnerability exists within the plugin that is directly used by Filament.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the plugin and vulnerability, potentially including data breaches, financial loss, or RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting:**  Carefully research and vet any third-party Filament plugins before installation.  Check the plugin's reputation, code quality, and security history.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions to receive security patches.
    *   **Minimal Plugin Usage:**  Use only essential plugins to minimize the attack surface.
    *   **Security Audits:**  Consider conducting security audits of critical plugins, especially if they handle sensitive data or operations.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Filament Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_filament_version.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of the *Filament framework itself*, which may contain known and patched vulnerabilities *specific to Filament's code*.
*   **Filament Contribution:** Filament, as a distinct software package, has its own codebase and potential vulnerabilities. Using an old version means these *Filament-specific* vulnerabilities are unpatched.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in Filament's resource authorization logic (a *Filament-specific* feature) is exploited because the application is running an older, unpatched version of Filament.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific Filament vulnerability, but could include any of the impacts mentioned above (authorization bypass, RCE, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Filament Updates:** Update *Filament itself* to the latest stable version.
    *   **Filament Security Advisories:** Monitor Filament's *own* security advisories and release notes.
    *   **Dependency Management (Filament Focus):** Use Composer to manage Filament and its dependencies, ensuring that *Filament* is updated.
    *   **Testing After Filament Updates:** Thoroughly test the application after updating *Filament* to ensure compatibility.
