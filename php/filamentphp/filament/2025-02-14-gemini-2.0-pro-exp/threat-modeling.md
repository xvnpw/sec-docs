# Threat Model Analysis for filamentphp/filament

## Threat: [Unauthorized Resource Access via Policy Bypass](./threats/unauthorized_resource_access_via_policy_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An authenticated attacker with limited privileges crafts a request that bypasses Filament's policy checks for a specific Resource.  This involves manipulating URL parameters, form data, or exploiting logical flaws in *custom* policy implementations specific to how Filament integrates with Laravel's policies. The attacker gains access to records or actions (create, update, delete) they are not authorized for.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Loss of data confidentiality, integrity, and potentially availability. Could lead to data breaches or system compromise.
*   **Filament Component Affected:** Filament Resources, Policies (specifically the methods within policy classes like `viewAny`, `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `restore`, `forceDelete`), Authorization logic *as implemented within Filament*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Policy Implementation:** Ensure *all* relevant policy methods (`viewAny`, `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, etc.) are implemented and correctly check user permissions *within the context of Filament's resource management*. Don't rely on default returns; explicitly define the logic.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* inputs, even those seemingly controlled by Filament, to prevent manipulation. This includes URL parameters and hidden form fields, specifically within Filament's request handling.
    *   **Testing:** Write comprehensive tests (unit and integration) specifically targeting policy enforcement *within Filament*. Try to bypass policies with different user roles and permissions, focusing on Filament's UI and API.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions *within the Filament admin panel*.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and audit policy implementations for logical flaws and potential bypasses, paying close attention to how they interact with Filament's features.

## Threat: [Action Manipulation - Unauthorized Action Execution](./threats/action_manipulation_-_unauthorized_action_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, possibly with limited access, triggers a Filament Action they are not authorized to use. This involves manipulating the request to bypass client-side checks or exploiting server-side vulnerabilities in the Action's logic *as implemented within Filament*.  The attacker might trigger a "Delete All Users" action without permissions, exploiting how Filament handles action execution.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized execution of actions, potentially leading to data loss, system disruption, or other unintended consequences. The impact is highly dependent on the specific Filament Action.
*   **Filament Component Affected:** Filament Actions (both standalone and those within Resources), Authorization logic *within Filament's Action handling*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the action's functionality).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Authorization:** Implement robust server-side authorization checks *within* the Filament Action's `handle` method (or equivalent). Do *not* rely solely on Filament's client-side visibility controls.  This authorization must be specific to Filament's action execution context.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate any input parameters passed to the Filament Action to prevent manipulation, specifically within Filament's request processing for actions.
    *   **Contextual Checks:** Consider the context in which the Filament Action is being executed. Check if the user has permission to perform the action on the *specific* record being targeted, within Filament's data handling.
    *   **Testing:** Write tests that specifically attempt to trigger unauthorized Filament Actions, focusing on Filament's API and UI for actions.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive Filament Actions to prevent abuse, using Filament's integration with Laravel's rate limiting features.

## Threat: [Unprotected Custom Pages](./threats/unprotected_custom_pages.md)

*   **Description:** A developer creates a custom Filament Page but forgets to apply proper authorization checks, leaving it accessible to unauthorized users or even unauthenticated users. This is a direct failure to use Filament's intended page protection mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the functionality and data exposed by the custom Filament page. This could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise, depending on the page's purpose.
*   **Filament Component Affected:** Filament Pages, Custom Page classes, Authorization logic *within Filament's page routing and access control*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the page's functionality).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit Authorization:** Implement explicit authorization checks within the custom Filament Page class, using Filament's `canAccess` method or Laravel's authorization mechanisms (policies, gates) *as integrated with Filament*.
    *   **Route Protection:** Ensure that the route associated with the custom Filament page is protected by appropriate middleware (e.g., `auth`, `verified`), leveraging Filament's routing integration.
    *   **Testing:** Write tests that specifically attempt to access the custom Filament page without the necessary permissions, using Filament's testing utilities.
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review custom Filament page implementations for missing authorization checks, focusing on Filament's page structure and lifecycle.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Relation Manager](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_relation_manager.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the ID of a related record within a Filament Relation Manager to access or modify data they shouldn't have access to. This exploits a failure to properly validate authorization *within Filament's relation management context*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of related data managed by Filament. Could lead to data breaches or system compromise.
*   **Filament Component Affected:** Filament Relation Managers, Authorization logic *within Filament's Relation Manager handling*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authorization Checks:** Implement authorization checks *within* the Filament Relation Manager to ensure that the user has permission to access or modify the *specific* related record being targeted. Do *not* rely solely on the parent resource's authorization checks. These checks must be integrated with Filament's relation management logic.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate the ID of the related record within the Filament Relation Manager to ensure it is a valid ID and that the user has permission to access it, using Filament's request handling.
    *   **Testing:** Write tests that specifically attempt to access or modify related records with different IDs *through Filament's Relation Manager UI and API*.

## Threat: [Notification-Based XSS (Filament-Specific Context)](./threats/notification-based_xss__filament-specific_context_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into data that is *then displayed* within a Filament Notification. While XSS is a general vulnerability, the *specific threat here* is failing to properly sanitize data displayed within Filament's notification system.
*   **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially leading to session hijacking or data theft *within the Filament admin panel*.
*   **Filament Component Affected:**  Filament Notifications, specifically the rendering of notification content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding:** *Always* encode any user-provided or potentially untrusted data *before* displaying it within a Filament Notification. Use appropriate HTML entity encoding to prevent the browser from interpreting the data as code, specifically within Filament's notification rendering logic.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** While input sanitization is generally important, focus on sanitizing data that will *specifically* be used in Filament Notifications.
