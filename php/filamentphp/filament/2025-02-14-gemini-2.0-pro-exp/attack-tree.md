## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Bypass Authentication/Authorization [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__bypass_authenticationauthorization__high-risk_.md)

**Description:** This is the most direct path to achieving the attacker's goal.  It involves circumventing the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Exploit Misconfigured Filament Resources [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__exploit_misconfigured_filament_resources__high-risk_.md)

**Description:** Filament Resources define how users interact with data.  Misconfigurations here can expose data or functionality to unauthorized users.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Incorrectly Defined `canViewAny`, `canView`, `canCreate`, `canEdit`, `canDelete` methods (or missing authorization checks) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__incorrectly_defined__canviewany____canview____cancreate____canedit____candelete__methods__o_d744dbe5.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The attacker attempts to access resources or perform actions without the required permissions.  This is possible if the resource's authorization methods are incorrectly implemented (e.g., always returning `true`) or if authorization checks are missing entirely.
**Example:** A user without "edit" permissions on a "Posts" resource could still modify posts if the `canEdit` method always returns `true`.
**Mitigation:**  Review all Filament Resource classes and ensure that the `canViewAny`, `canView`, `canCreate`, `canEdit`, and `canDelete` methods (and any other relevant authorization methods) correctly implement the intended access control logic.  Use Filament's policy integration to centralize authorization logic.  Thoroughly test each action with different user roles.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.4. Exploiting Weaknesses in Custom Actions/Bulk Actions (if authorization is not properly enforced within the action's logic) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_4__exploiting_weaknesses_in_custom_actionsbulk_actions__if_authorization_is_not_properly_enfor_23f3cfa9.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker triggers a custom action or bulk action that performs sensitive operations without proper authorization checks *within the action's code*. Even if the resource itself has authorization checks, the custom action might bypass them.
**Example:** A custom action to "Delete All Users" might not check if the current user has the necessary permissions to perform this action.
**Mitigation:** Ensure that *all* custom actions and bulk actions have explicit authorization checks within their execution logic.  Do not rely solely on resource-level authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Exploit Filament's User Impersonation Feature (if enabled and misconfigured)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__exploit_filament's_user_impersonation_feature__if_enabled_and_misconfigured_.md)

**Description:** Filament's impersonation feature allows administrators to temporarily log in as another user.  If misconfigured, this can be abused to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1. Lack of Restrictions on Who Can Impersonate [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1__lack_of_restrictions_on_who_can_impersonate__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  A user with lower privileges gains access to the impersonation feature and uses it to impersonate an administrator or another user with higher privileges.
**Example:** A "moderator" user could impersonate an "administrator" user and gain full access to the system.
**Mitigation:**  Restrict the impersonation feature to specific, highly trusted users (e.g., super-administrators only).  Implement robust logging of all impersonation events.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Exploit Filament's Form Builder](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__exploit_filament's_form_builder.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input in Custom Form Fields [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_input_in_custom_form_fields__high-risk_.md)

**Description:**  XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which is then executed in the browsers of other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization in Custom Field Types [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__insufficient_input_validationsanitization_in_custom_field_types__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker submits a form containing malicious JavaScript code in a custom form field.  If the application does not properly sanitize this input before rendering it in the view, the code will be executed.
**Example:**  A custom "Rich Text Editor" field might not properly sanitize HTML tags, allowing an attacker to inject `<script>` tags containing malicious code.
**Mitigation:**  Ensure that *all* custom form field types properly sanitize user input *before* rendering it in the view.  Use Laravel's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{ }}` in Blade templates).  Thoroughly test with various XSS payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Form Submissions [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_form_submissions__high-risk_.md)

**Description:** IDOR vulnerabilities allow attackers to access or modify data they should not have access to by manipulating identifiers (e.g., record IDs) in form submissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1. Lack of Authorization Checks When Handling Form Data (e.g., allowing a user to modify a record they don't own by manipulating form data) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1__lack_of_authorization_checks_when_handling_form_data__e_g___allowing_a_user_to_modify_a_rec_25247a45.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker submits a form, modifying the ID of a record to one they do not own.  If the application does not properly check authorization *when handling the form data*, the attacker can modify or delete the record.
**Example:**  A user editing their profile might change the `user_id` in the form data to that of another user and modify their profile information.
**Mitigation:**  Implement robust authorization checks *within* the form submission handling logic (e.g., in the Resource's `form` method or in a dedicated Form Request).  Verify that the current user has permission to access or modify the specific record being processed.  Do *not* rely solely on Filament's resource-level authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3. File Upload Vulnerabilities (if Filament's file upload component is misconfigured or vulnerable) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3__file_upload_vulnerabilities__if_filament's_file_upload_component_is_misconfigured_or_vulnerab_39372fc4.md)

**Description:** File upload vulnerabilities can allow attackers to upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3.1. Lack of File Type Validation (allowing upload of malicious files, e.g., PHP scripts) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_1__lack_of_file_type_validation__allowing_upload_of_malicious_files__e_g___php_scripts___criti_46363852.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker uploads a file with a malicious extension (e.g., `.php`, `.phtml`, `.phar`) that can be executed by the server.
**Example:**  An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image file.  If the server executes this script, the attacker gains control of the application.
**Mitigation:**  Implement strict file type validation, preferably using a whitelist approach (allow only specific, safe file types).  Validate both the file extension *and* the MIME type.  Do *not* rely solely on the file extension for validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Exploit Filament's Table Builder](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__exploit_filament's_table_builder.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. XSS via Unsanitized Data Displayed in Tables [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__xss_via_unsanitized_data_displayed_in_tables__high-risk_.md)

**Description:** Similar to XSS in form fields, this involves injecting malicious code into data displayed in tables.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.1. Insufficient Output Escaping in Custom Column Renderers [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_1__insufficient_output_escaping_in_custom_column_renderers__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into data that is later displayed in a table. If a custom column renderer does not properly escape this data, the script will execute.
**Example:** If a table displays user comments, and a custom column renderer is used to format these comments, an attacker could inject a `<script>` tag into a comment.
**Mitigation:** Ensure that *all* custom column renderers properly escape data before displaying it in the table. Use Laravel's Blade escaping syntax (`{{ }}`).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Filament Plugins [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_filament_plugins__high-risk_.md)

**Description:** Third-party plugins can introduce vulnerabilities if they are not properly vetted, updated, or configured.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Plugins [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_plugins__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies a known vulnerability in a plugin used by the application and exploits it.
**Example:** A plugin might have a known SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker uses this vulnerability to gain access to the database.
**Mitigation:** Keep *all* plugins updated to the latest versions. Monitor security advisories for plugins and apply patches promptly. Carefully vet plugins before installing them, and consider the security implications of using third-party code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related to Filament)](./attack_tree_paths/3__dependency_vulnerabilities__indirectly_related_to_filament_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Vulnerabilities in Filament's Dependencies (e.g., Laravel, Livewire, Alpine.js) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__vulnerabilities_in_filament's_dependencies__e_g___laravel__livewire__alpine_js___high-risk_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Filament's dependencies (Laravel, Livewire, Alpine.js, etc.) can be exploited to compromise the application.
**Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency.
**Example:** A vulnerability in Laravel's routing component could be exploited to bypass authentication.
**Mitigation:** Keep *all* dependencies updated to the latest versions. Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `composer audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities.
