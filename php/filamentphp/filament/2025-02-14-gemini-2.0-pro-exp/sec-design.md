Okay, let's create a design document for the FilamentPHP project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

FilamentPHP is an open-source collection of tools for rapidly building TALL stack apps (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire). It appears to be targeted at individual developers and small to medium-sized teams who want to build admin panels, dashboards, and other web applications quickly and efficiently using the Laravel ecosystem.  The primary business goal is to provide a developer-friendly, feature-rich, and customizable framework that accelerates development and reduces the time to market for web applications.

Business Priorities:

*   Rapid Development: Enable developers to build applications quickly.
*   Developer Experience: Provide a clean, intuitive, and enjoyable development experience.
*   Customizability: Allow developers to easily customize and extend the framework.
*   Community Growth: Foster a strong and active community around the project.
*   Maintainability: Ensure the codebase is well-structured and maintainable.

Business Risks:

*   Security Vulnerabilities:  As a popular open-source project, Filament is a potential target for attackers. Vulnerabilities in the framework could compromise applications built with it.
*   Dependency Management:  Reliance on multiple third-party libraries (Tailwind, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire) introduces risks related to the security and maintenance of those dependencies.
*   Breaking Changes:  Major updates to underlying technologies (e.g., Laravel, Livewire) could introduce breaking changes that require significant effort to address.
*   Lack of Adoption: If the project fails to gain sufficient traction, it may become difficult to maintain and support in the long term.
*   Data Breaches: Applications built with Filament will likely handle sensitive data, making data breaches a significant risk.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Filament provides built-in authentication features, likely leveraging Laravel's authentication system. (Described in Filament documentation and Laravel documentation).
*   security control: Authorization: Filament offers authorization capabilities, probably using Laravel's authorization mechanisms (gates and policies). (Described in Filament documentation and Laravel documentation).
*   security control: Input Validation: Filament likely uses Laravel's validation features to validate user input. (Described in Filament documentation and Laravel documentation).
*   security control: CSRF Protection: Filament, through Laravel, includes CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. (Described in Laravel documentation).
*   security control: Database Security: Filament uses Laravel's Eloquent ORM, which, when used correctly, helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. (Described in Laravel documentation).
*   security control: XSS Protection: Livewire, used by Filament, has built-in mechanisms to escape output and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (Described in Livewire documentation).
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses Composer for dependency management, allowing for regular updates and security patches. (Described in `composer.json` file).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities: While Composer helps manage dependencies, there's an inherent risk of vulnerabilities in third-party packages.
*   accepted risk: Configuration Errors: The security of applications built with Filament ultimately depends on the correct configuration and secure coding practices of the developers using it.
*   accepted risk: Zero-Day Exploits: There's always a risk of zero-day exploits in any software, including Filament and its dependencies.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the Filament codebase and its dependencies.
*   security control: Penetration Testing: Perform regular penetration testing on applications built with Filament.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Security Headers: Enforce the use of security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) to enhance browser security.
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Encourage or require the use of 2FA for user accounts.
*   security control: Automated Security Scanning: Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify and track vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong password policies.
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
    *   Option for multi-factor authentication.
    *   Secure session management.

*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC).
    *   Fine-grained permission management.
    *   Ability to restrict access to specific resources and actions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user input on the server-side.
    *   Use a whitelist approach to define allowed input.
    *   Sanitize input to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Securely store sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys).
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Properly manage cryptographic keys.

## BUILD

The Filament project uses Composer for dependency management and likely employs a combination of manual and automated build steps.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[Developer] -- "Commits code" --> GitHub[GitHub Repository]
    GitHub -- "Triggers" --> CI[CI/CD Pipeline - GitHub Actions]
    CI -- "Runs tests" --> Tests[Unit/Feature Tests]
    CI -- "Builds assets" --> Assets[Compile Assets - npm]
    CI -- "Manages dependencies" --> Composer[Composer Install]
    Composer -- "Downloads dependencies" --> Dependencies[Third-Party Packages]
    CI -- "Packages application" --> Artifact[Build Artifact]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions (or a similar CI/CD system) is triggered.
3.  The CI/CD pipeline runs unit and feature tests.
4.  The pipeline compiles assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) using npm.
5.  Composer installs project dependencies.
6.  The application is packaged into a build artifact (e.g., a Docker image, a deployment package).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Dependency Management: Composer.lock ensures consistent dependency versions.
*   security control: Automated Testing: Unit and feature tests help identify bugs early.
*   security control: Static Code Analysis: Linters and static analysis tools (potentially integrated into the CI/CD pipeline) can identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Tools like Dependabot (integrated with GitHub) can identify vulnerable dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   User Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring only authorized users can access and modify data.
*   Data Management: Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data stored and processed by applications built with Filament.
*   Application Availability: Maintaining the availability of applications built with Filament.

Data Sensitivity:

*   User Data: Personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, email addresses, and potentially more sensitive data depending on the application. Sensitivity: High.
*   Application Data: Data specific to the application built with Filament, which could range from low to high sensitivity depending on the application's purpose.
*   Configuration Data: API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive configuration information. Sensitivity: High.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
