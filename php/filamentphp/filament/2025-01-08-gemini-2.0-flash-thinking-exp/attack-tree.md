## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data Through Filament Forms/Tables](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_through_filament_formstables.md)

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject Malicious Code via Form Fields (e.g., XSS in displayed data, leading to admin compromise)
*   **CRITICAL NODE:** Execute Malicious Code via Custom Actions (If custom actions have vulnerabilities)

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Filament Components/Widgets (If custom code is insecure)
*   **CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH:** Leverage Unsafe File Upload Functionality (If Filament is configured with insecure file handling)
*   **CRITICAL NODE:** Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Filament uses insecure deserialization practices)
*   **CRITICAL NODE:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries Used by Filament (Indirectly through Filament)

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_sensitive_information.md)

*   **CRITICAL NODE:** Access Database Credentials or Configuration (If exposed within Filament's configuration or code)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Filament's Livewire Integration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_filament's_livewire_integration.md)

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Inject Malicious JavaScript via Livewire (Potentially leading to XSS within the admin panel)
*   Exploit Server-Side Rendering Issues in Livewire Components (If not handled securely)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Filament Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_filament_application.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Brute-force Weak Credentials:** Attackers attempt to guess usernames and passwords, especially if default credentials haven't been changed or users have weak passwords.
*   **Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Filament:**  Attackers leverage publicly known security flaws in Filament's authentication logic to bypass the login process.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers steal valid user session identifiers to impersonate legitimate users without needing their credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authorization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Manipulate Role/Permission Assignments:** Attackers gain the ability to modify user roles or permissions, granting themselves elevated privileges within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Form Fields](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_form_fields.md)

Attackers insert malicious code (like JavaScript for Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) into form fields that are later displayed to other users or administrators without proper sanitization. This can lead to account takeover or data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Code via Custom Actions](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_code_via_custom_actions.md)

If developers create custom actions within Filament's table or form builders and these actions contain security vulnerabilities, attackers can trigger these actions to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Filament Components/Widgets](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_filament_componentswidgets.md)

If developers create custom components or widgets for Filament, security flaws in this custom code can be exploited to achieve RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Unsafe File Upload Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_unsafe_file_upload_functionality.md)

If Filament allows file uploads without proper security measures (like size limits, content type validation, or storing files in web-accessible directories), attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP webshells) and execute them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

If Filament uses insecure deserialization of user-controlled data, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when processed, execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries Used by Filament](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries_used_by_filament.md)

Filament relies on various PHP libraries. If any of these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, attackers might be able to exploit them indirectly through the Filament application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Database Credentials or Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/access_database_credentials_or_configuration.md)

If database credentials or other sensitive configuration details are inadvertently exposed within Filament's configuration files or code, attackers can gain direct access to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript via Livewire](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_via_livewire.md)

If user-provided data is not properly sanitized when rendered within Livewire components, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to XSS attacks within the admin panel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering Issues in Livewire Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering_issues_in_livewire_components.md)

Vulnerabilities in how Livewire renders components on the server could be exploited to leak sensitive information or, in more severe cases, achieve remote code execution.
