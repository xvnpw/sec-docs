# Attack Surface Analysis for filamentphp/filament

## Attack Surface: [Filament Panel Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/filament_panel_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:**  An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Filament admin panel without providing valid credentials.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament implements its own authentication layer on top of Laravel's. Vulnerabilities in this implementation (e.g., flaws in session management, password reset logic, or two-factor authentication if implemented) can create this attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Filament's login form to bypass the authentication check, gaining full administrative access.

**Impact:** Complete control over the application's data and functionality managed through Filament. Potential for data breaches, manipulation, and service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize strong and well-tested authentication mechanisms provided by Laravel and Filament.
*   Implement and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Regularly update Filament to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   Thoroughly review and test any custom authentication logic implemented within Filament.
*   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Filament Forms and Table Columns](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_filament_forms_and_table_columns.md)

**Description:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into form fields or data displayed in Filament tables, which are then executed in the browsers of other users.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament renders user-provided data within its forms and tables. If this data is not properly sanitized or escaped, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. This includes data directly entered by users and data fetched from the database.

**Example:** An attacker enters a malicious `<script>` tag into a text field within a Filament form. When another administrator views the record, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account takeover, defacement of the admin panel, redirection to malicious sites, and potential data theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Filament's built-in form field types and table column types that automatically handle output escaping.
*   Sanitize user input on the server-side before storing it in the database.
*   Ensure all data displayed in Filament tables is properly escaped using Blade's `{{ }}` syntax or the `e()` helper function.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Vulnerabilities within Filament Resources and Pages](./attack_surfaces/authorization_vulnerabilities_within_filament_resources_and_pages.md)

**Description:**  Users can access or manipulate data and functionalities within Filament Resources or custom Pages that they are not authorized to interact with.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament provides a mechanism for defining authorization rules within Resources and Pages using policies and gates. Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in these authorization checks can lead to unauthorized access.

**Example:** A user with a "viewer" role can access the edit page for a Resource and modify sensitive data because the authorization policy is not correctly implemented or enforced.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define clear and comprehensive authorization policies for all Filament Resources and Pages.
*   Thoroughly test authorization rules to ensure they function as intended.
*   Utilize Filament's built-in authorization features and avoid implementing custom, potentially flawed authorization logic.
*   Regularly review and update authorization policies as application requirements change.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads through Filament Forms](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads_through_filament_forms.md)

**Description:**  Attackers can upload malicious files through Filament's file upload form fields, potentially leading to remote code execution or other vulnerabilities.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament provides file upload form field types. If these are not properly configured and validated, attackers can upload files of arbitrary types and sizes to potentially vulnerable locations.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image through a Filament form. If the server is not configured correctly, this script could be executed, granting the attacker control over the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, server compromise, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict file type validation on the server-side.
*   Validate file sizes to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
*   Store uploaded files outside of the webroot and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism.
*   Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable file names.
*   Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Filament Components and Integrations](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_filament_components_and_integrations.md)

**Description:**  Security flaws introduced by developers when creating custom form fields, widgets, actions, or integrations with other systems within the Filament ecosystem.

**How Filament Contributes:** Filament is designed to be extensible. Developers can create custom components and integrate with other services. Security vulnerabilities in this custom code directly impact the application's attack surface.

**Example:** A developer creates a custom form field that does not properly sanitize user input, leading to an XSS vulnerability. Or, an integration with an external API exposes sensitive credentials.

**Impact:** Varies widely depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially ranging from minor information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Filament components and integrations.
*   Thoroughly review and test all custom code for security vulnerabilities.
*   Keep dependencies of custom components up to date.
*   Implement proper input validation and output encoding in custom components.
*   Securely manage API keys and other sensitive credentials used in integrations.
