# Threat Model Analysis for filamentphp/filament

## Threat: [Default Super Admin Credentials Exploitation](./threats/default_super_admin_credentials_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in using default or easily guessable credentials for the initial super admin account created by Filament during installation. This could be done through brute-force attacks or by finding publicly available default credentials if developers fail to change them.
*   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the Filament panel, allowing the attacker to control the application, access and modify all data, create new malicious users, and potentially gain access to the underlying server.
*   **Affected Component:** Filament's User Management (initial setup process).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Force a strong password change during the initial setup process of the Filament application.
    *   Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials immediately after installation.
    *   Consider removing the default super admin account creation in favor of a more secure initial user setup.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities through Filament Forms](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_through_filament_forms.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate HTTP request parameters when submitting Filament forms to modify model attributes that are not intended to be publicly accessible or modifiable. This is possible due to how Filament's form builder interacts with Eloquent models and if developers haven't properly defined `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties or configured resource fields.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, potential privilege escalation (by modifying user roles or permissions), or data corruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Filament Form Builder, Eloquent Model Integration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly define the `$fillable` and `$guarded` properties on all Eloquent models used with Filament.
    *   Carefully configure the fields included in Filament forms, ensuring only necessary and safe attributes are exposed for modification.
    *   Utilize Filament's form validation rules to further restrict input values.
    *   Consider using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to handle form input and map them to model attributes.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling in Filament Forms](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling_in_filament_forms.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) through Filament form file upload fields if proper validation and sanitization are not implemented within the Filament form configuration or custom upload handling logic.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, defacement of the application, or further compromise of the underlying system.
*   **Affected Component:** Filament Form Builder (File Upload component).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation on file uploads within Filament's form configuration, including allowed file types, sizes, and MIME types.
    *   Sanitize uploaded file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web root and serve them through a controller with appropriate access controls.
    *   Utilize a dedicated file storage service with built-in security features.
    *   Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Filament Form Inputs](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_filament_form_inputs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into Filament form fields. This code could then be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the submitted data, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on their behalf. This directly relates to how Filament renders form inputs and displays submitted data.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement, or spreading of malware.
*   **Affected Component:** Filament Form Builder, potentially Filament Table Builder (if displaying user-generated content from forms).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize all user inputs rendered by Filament, especially content submitted through forms.
    *   Utilize Blade's escaping syntax (`{{ }}`) to prevent the execution of HTML and JavaScript.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or entering sensitive information in untrusted forms.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Filament's Debug Mode](./threats/information_disclosure_through_filament's_debug_mode.md)

*   **Description:** If the application is deployed with Filament's debug mode enabled (or Laravel's `APP_DEBUG` set to `true`), detailed error messages, stack traces, and potentially sensitive configuration information related to Filament and the application could be exposed to users. Attackers could leverage this information to understand the application's internals and identify further vulnerabilities within Filament's components or the application itself.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, internal application details, and potential attack vectors.
*   **Affected Component:** Filament's Error Handling, Laravel's Debug Mode integration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (in production environments)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that debug mode is disabled (`APP_DEBUG=false`) in production environments.
    *   Configure proper error logging and monitoring to capture errors without exposing sensitive details to end-users.

## Threat: [Bypassing Filament's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./threats/bypassing_filament's_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:** If developers incorrectly implement or configure Filament's RBAC features, attackers might find ways to bypass permission checks and access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for within the Filament admin panel. This could involve manipulating request parameters specific to Filament's authorization logic or exploiting flaws in how permissions are checked within Filament components.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Filament's Authorization System (Policies, Roles, Permissions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully define and implement roles and permissions within Filament.
    *   Thoroughly test authorization rules to ensure they are enforced correctly within Filament's context.
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for authorization within the Filament panel.
    *   Regularly review and audit the application's RBAC configuration within Filament.
