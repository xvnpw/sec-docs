# Attack Surface Analysis for roots/sage

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into server-side templates, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**How Sage Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sage utilizes the Blade templating engine. If developers use unescaped output (`!!`) or dynamically construct template paths based on user input without proper sanitization, they introduce this risk.

**Example:** A developer uses `{{ !! request()->get('name') !! }}` within a Blade template, directly rendering a user-provided name without sanitization. An attacker could then provide a malicious payload in the `name` parameter, potentially executing code on the server.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always escape user input:** Use the default `{{ }}` Blade syntax for automatic escaping.
*   **Avoid `!!` for user-provided data:** Only use unescaped output for trusted content.
*   **Sanitize user input:** Before passing user input to Blade templates, sanitize it using appropriate server-side functions.
*   **Avoid dynamic template paths based on user input:** This can be a major source of SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Node.js Packages](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_node_js_packages.md)

**Description:** Sage relies on numerous Node.js packages managed by Yarn. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the build process or the final assets.

**How Sage Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sage's modern frontend tooling necessitates the use of a large number of Node.js packages. This inherently increases the attack surface due to the potential for vulnerabilities in these third-party libraries.

**Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a popular JavaScript library used by Sage (e.g., through `npm audit`). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses the affected version of the library.

**Impact:**  Code execution during the build process, compromised frontend assets, potential server compromise if vulnerable dependencies are used on the backend (though less direct with Sage).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly update dependencies:** Use `yarn upgrade` or similar commands to keep dependencies up-to-date.
*   **Use vulnerability scanning tools:** Integrate tools like `npm audit` or dedicated dependency scanning services into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Review dependency licenses:** Be aware of the licenses of the dependencies and potential security implications.
*   **Consider using lock files (yarn.lock):** Ensure lock files are committed to maintain consistent dependency versions across environments.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/build_process_manipulation.md)

**Description:** If an attacker gains access to the development environment or CI/CD pipeline, they could inject malicious code into the compiled assets through manipulating Webpack configuration or build scripts.

**How Sage Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Sage's build process, powered by Webpack and Yarn, introduces a layer of complexity. Compromising this process allows for injecting malicious code that will be deployed to the production environment.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Git repository and modifies the `webpack.config.js` file to inject malicious JavaScript code into the bundled assets. This code will then be executed in the browsers of users visiting the website.

**Impact:**  Compromised frontend functionality, redirection to malicious sites, data theft from users' browsers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure development environments:** Implement strong access controls and security practices for development machines.
*   **Secure CI/CD pipelines:** Implement security measures for CI/CD systems, including access control, secret management, and regular audits.
*   **Code review build scripts:** Regularly review Webpack configuration and build scripts for any suspicious or unauthorized modifications.
*   **Use trusted CI/CD providers:** Opt for reputable and secure CI/CD platforms.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of `.env` Files](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of___env__files.md)

**Description:** Sage often uses `.env` files to store environment variables. If these files are not properly secured and accidentally committed to version control or exposed on the server, sensitive information like API keys or database credentials could be compromised.

**How Sage Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While not unique to Sage, its modern development workflow often encourages the use of `.env` files, making their secure handling crucial.

**Example:** A developer accidentally commits the `.env` file to a public Git repository, exposing database credentials to anyone who finds it.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never commit `.env` files to version control:** Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file.
*   **Use secure environment variable management:** Explore secure alternatives for managing environment variables in production, such as platform-specific solutions or dedicated secret management tools.
*   **Restrict access to `.env` files on the server:** Ensure that the `.env` file is not publicly accessible on the production server.
