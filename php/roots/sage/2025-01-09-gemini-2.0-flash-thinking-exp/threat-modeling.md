# Threat Model Analysis for roots/sage

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Node.js Dependency (Specifically targeting Sage's dependencies or build process)](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_node_js_dependency__specifically_targeting_sage's_dependencies_or__dde4fc22.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency specifically relied upon or heavily integrated within the Sage framework's build process (e.g., a Webpack plugin recommended by Sage, a core Sage dependency). The attacker injects malicious code into this package, which is then included when developers install or update dependencies. This malicious code could be designed to specifically target Sage's build steps, inject backdoors into the theme, or steal sensitive configuration data used by Sage.
*   **Impact:** Potentially critical. Could lead to full compromise of the build environment and deployed application, allowing attackers to inject malicious code directly into the theme, steal sensitive data used by Sage, or disrupt service.
*   **Affected Component:** `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `node_modules` directory (specifically dependencies critical to Sage's functionality).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and review project dependencies, paying special attention to those directly recommended or used by Sage.
    *   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Consider using a dependency management tool that supports security scanning and alerts, focusing on identifying threats specific to frontend build pipelines.
    *   Pin dependency versions in `package.json` and use `yarn.lock` to ensure consistent dependency resolution.
    *   Be cautious when updating dependencies and thoroughly review changelogs, especially for dependencies deeply integrated with Sage.
    *   Consider using a private npm registry or repository manager for greater control over dependencies used by Sage.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Misconfigured Webpack (Within Sage's context)](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_misconfigured_webpack__within_sage's_context_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive information due to misconfigurations in the `webpack.config.js` file provided or recommended by Sage, or through customizations made to it. This could involve unintentionally exposing source maps in production builds (making it easier to understand Sage's theme structure and potentially find vulnerabilities), or including development-only code or debugging information within the final theme assets.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Source maps can significantly aid reverse engineering and vulnerability discovery within the Sage theme. Exposed development code could reveal sensitive implementation details or logic specific to how Sage handles data.
*   **Affected Component:** `webpack.config.js`, built assets (JavaScript, CSS) generated by Sage's build process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure source maps are explicitly disabled or properly configured for production environments within `webpack.config.js`.
    *   Carefully review the Webpack configuration provided by Sage and any customizations to prevent the inclusion of development-specific code in production builds.
    *   Use environment variables and build-time flags within the Webpack configuration to conditionally include/exclude code based on the environment.
    *   Implement proper access controls on deployed theme assets.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Blade Templates (Due to misuse within Sage themes)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_blade_templates__due_to_misuse_within_sage_themes_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits improper handling of dynamic data within Blade templates specifically within a Sage-based theme. If developers using Sage directly render user-controlled input without proper escaping using Blade's syntax, an attacker could inject malicious Blade syntax or PHP code that executes on the server. This could lead to remote code execution or access to sensitive server-side resources. This threat is directly tied to how developers utilize Blade within the Sage framework.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Allows for complete server compromise and data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** Blade template files (`.blade.php`) within the Sage theme.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly adhere to Blade's escaped output syntax `{{ $variable }}` for displaying dynamic data in Sage templates.** This automatically escapes HTML entities.
    *   Be extremely cautious when using raw output syntax ` {!! $variable !!}` within Sage themes and ensure the data being rendered is absolutely trusted and has been rigorously sanitized.
    *   Avoid complex logic and direct execution of user-provided data within Blade templates in Sage themes.
    *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization before passing data to Blade templates within the Sage theme.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in `.env` Files (Within a Sage project context)](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_credentials_in___env__files__within_a_sage_project_context_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `.env` file within a project built using Sage. This file often contains sensitive information like database credentials, API keys for services used by the theme, and other secrets relevant to the application's functionality within the Sage environment. This could happen due to misconfigured web servers serving Sage themes, accidental inclusion of `.env` in the theme's version control, or vulnerabilities in deployment processes for Sage-based applications.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Direct access to sensitive credentials can lead to database breaches, unauthorized access to third-party services integrated with the Sage theme, and complete application compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `.env` file within the Sage project directory.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never commit `.env` files to version control for Sage themes.** Ensure `.gitignore` is properly configured within the Sage project to exclude this file.
    *   Configure web servers hosting Sage themes to prevent direct access to `.env` files.
    *   Use secure methods for managing and injecting environment variables in production environments for Sage-based applications (e.g., environment variables set at the server level, secrets management tools specifically designed for web applications).
    *   Consider using encrypted storage for sensitive configuration data used by the Sage theme.

## Threat: [Insecure Asset Handling Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Through Sage's build pipeline)](./threats/insecure_asset_handling_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss___through_sage's_build_pipeline_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into assets (like CSS or JavaScript files) *during the Sage theme's build process*. This could be due to vulnerabilities in Webpack plugins used by Sage's configuration or through a compromised dependency that manipulates assets. When these built assets are served to users, the malicious scripts execute in their browsers, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions. This is specific to how Sage manages and builds its assets.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to account takeover, data theft, and defacement of the application using the Sage theme.
*   **Affected Component:** Webpack configuration within Sage, asset processing pipeline defined by Sage, built assets (JavaScript, CSS) generated by Sage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and understand the Webpack configuration provided by Sage and any plugins it uses for asset processing.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources when using a Sage theme.
    *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided data that might be incorporated into assets during the Sage build process.
    *   Regularly review the asset build process defined by Sage for potential vulnerabilities or insecure configurations.
