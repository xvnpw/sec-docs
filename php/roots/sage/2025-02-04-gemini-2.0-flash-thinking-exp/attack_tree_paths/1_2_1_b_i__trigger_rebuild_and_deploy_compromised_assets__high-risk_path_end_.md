### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1.b.i. Trigger Rebuild and Deploy Compromised Assets

**Attack Path:** 1.2.1.b.i. Trigger rebuild and deploy compromised assets

**High-Risk Path Justification:** High likelihood due to automated deployment processes and high impact as it deploys the compromised application to production.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path and Preceding Steps (Inferred):**

To reach the point of "Trigger rebuild and deploy compromised assets," the attacker must have already successfully completed several preceding steps.  While the attack tree path notation is concise, we can infer a likely sequence of events:

* **1. [Compromise Application (Top-Level Goal - Inferred from Context)]** - The ultimate goal of the attacker is to compromise the live application.
    * **1.2. [Gain Access to Deployment Pipeline (Sub-Goal - Inferred)]** - To reliably and persistently compromise the application, attackers often target the deployment pipeline.
        * **1.2.1. [Compromise CI/CD System or Related Infrastructure (Sub-Goal - Inferred)]** -  This could involve compromising the CI/CD server itself, the source code repository, build tools, or related infrastructure used in the deployment process.
            * **1.2.1.b. [Inject Malicious Code/Assets into Source Code or Build Process (Specific Action - Inferred)]** -  This is a crucial step where the attacker introduces the malicious payload. This could be achieved through various methods:
                * **1.2.1.b.i. [Compromise Developer Workstation and Commit Malicious Code]** - An attacker could compromise a developer's machine and use their credentials to commit malicious code to the repository.
                * **1.2.1.b.ii. [Compromise Source Code Repository Credentials]** - Directly obtaining credentials for the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) allows for direct manipulation of the codebase.
                * **1.2.1.b.iii. [Supply Chain Attack - Compromise Dependencies]** - Injecting malicious code into a dependency (e.g., a Composer package or npm module) used by the Sage application.
                * **1.2.1.b.iv. [Manipulate Build Scripts or Configuration]** - Modifying build scripts (e.g., `package.json`, `composer.json`, build tooling configurations like Webpack or Gulp/Grunt configurations if still in use) to inject malicious code during the build process.
            * **1.2.1.b.i. [Trigger rebuild and deploy compromised assets (Target Attack Path)]** -  **This is the focus of our analysis.** Once malicious code or assets are injected, the attacker needs to trigger the automated deployment process to push the compromised version to production.

**Detailed Analysis of "Trigger rebuild and deploy compromised assets":**

* **Action:** The attacker initiates a rebuild and deployment of the application.
* **Mechanism:** This typically leverages the automated CI/CD pipeline configured for the Sage/Roots application. Common triggers for rebuild and deployment include:
    * **Code Push to Repository:**  The most common trigger. If the attacker has successfully committed malicious code (as described in inferred steps above), pushing this commit to the designated branch (e.g., `main`, `production`) will automatically initiate the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Manual Trigger via CI/CD System UI/API:** If the attacker has gained access to the CI/CD system (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), they could manually trigger a build and deployment.
    * **Scheduled Builds (Less likely for immediate attack, but possible):** While less direct, if scheduled builds are in place, the compromised code will eventually be built and deployed during the next scheduled run.
    * **Webhook Manipulation (More advanced):**  In sophisticated attacks, attackers might manipulate webhooks that trigger deployments from other systems (e.g., CMS content updates triggering redeployment).

* **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** To reach this stage, the attacker has likely exploited vulnerabilities in preceding steps.  However, the "Trigger rebuild and deploy" stage itself relies on the *misconfiguration or lack of security controls* in the CI/CD pipeline.  Specifically:
    * **Lack of Code Integrity Checks:**  The CI/CD pipeline does not adequately verify the integrity and security of the code being deployed. This includes:
        * **No automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the pipeline.**
        * **No code review process for all changes, especially before deployment to production.**
        * **Lack of cryptographic signing or verification of code artifacts.**
    * **Insufficient Access Control in CI/CD:**  If the attacker has compromised credentials or gained unauthorized access to the CI/CD system, they can directly trigger deployments.
    * **Overly Permissive Deployment Triggers:**  If deployment triggers are too easily activated (e.g., any push to `main` immediately deploys without further checks), it simplifies the attacker's task.
    * **Lack of Monitoring and Alerting for Deployment Anomalies:**  If the deployment process is not properly monitored, unauthorized or suspicious deployments might go unnoticed.

* **Threat Actors:**  Potential threat actors who might attempt this attack path include:
    * **External Attackers:**  Motivated by financial gain, data theft, disruption, or reputational damage.
    * **Malicious Insiders:**  Disgruntled employees or compromised internal accounts with access to the development or deployment infrastructure.
    * **Nation-State Actors:**  For espionage, sabotage, or strategic advantage.

* **Impact:**  The impact of successfully deploying compromised assets to production can be severe:
    * **Compromise of Confidentiality:**  Exposure of sensitive data, customer information, or proprietary code.
    * **Compromise of Integrity:**  Defacement of the website, data manipulation, application malfunction, introduction of backdoors.
    * **Compromise of Availability:**  Denial-of-service attacks, application crashes, or complete system downtime.
    * **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust, negative media attention, and long-term damage to brand image.
    * **Financial Loss:**  Loss of revenue, fines for data breaches, cost of incident response and remediation.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk associated with the "Trigger rebuild and deploy compromised assets" attack path, a layered security approach is recommended, focusing on preventative, detective, and responsive controls:

**A. Preventative Controls:**

* **Secure Source Code Repository:**
    * **Strong Access Control:** Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all repository access.
    * **Branch Protection:** Enforce branch protection rules on critical branches (e.g., `main`, `production`) requiring code reviews and approvals before merging.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit repository access and permissions.
* **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to CI/CD pipelines and service accounts.
    * **Secure CI/CD Infrastructure:** Harden CI/CD servers and infrastructure, keeping software up-to-date and applying security patches.
    * **Secrets Management:**  Securely manage and store secrets (API keys, credentials) used in the CI/CD pipeline using dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). Avoid hardcoding secrets in code or CI/CD configurations.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure (where feasible):**  Utilize immutable infrastructure for deployment environments to reduce the attack surface and ensure consistency.
    * **Secure Build Process:**
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (Composer, npm/yarn).
        * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**  Use SCA tools to analyze the application's codebase and dependencies for known vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
        * **Build Artifact Integrity:**  Consider signing build artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
* **Code Security Practices:**
    * **Secure Coding Training:**  Provide developers with secure coding training to minimize vulnerabilities introduced during development.
    * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities during the build process.
    * **Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews for all code changes, focusing on both functionality and security.
* **Secure Deployment Process:**
    * **Deployment Pipeline Security Scanning:** Integrate security scanning (SAST, DAST, vulnerability scanning) into the deployment pipeline before pushing to production.
    * **Staged Deployments (e.g., Canary, Blue/Green):**  Implement staged deployments to minimize the impact of deploying compromised code and allow for easier rollback.
    * **Rollback Procedures:**  Establish clear and tested rollback procedures to quickly revert to a previous known-good version in case of a compromised deployment.

**B. Detective Controls:**

* **CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Comprehensive Logging:**  Enable detailed logging for all CI/CD pipeline activities, including build triggers, code changes, deployments, and access attempts.
    * **Real-time Monitoring:**  Implement real-time monitoring of the CI/CD pipeline for anomalies, unauthorized access, and suspicious activities.
    * **Alerting and Notifications:**  Configure alerts for critical events in the CI/CD pipeline, such as failed builds, unauthorized deployments, or security scan findings.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate CI/CD logs and security alerts into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and analysis.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct periodic security audits of the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure, and perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

**C. Responsive Controls:**

* **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for security incidents related to the CI/CD pipeline and compromised deployments.
* **Automated Rollback:**  Implement automated rollback mechanisms that can be triggered in response to detected security incidents or deployment failures.
* **Communication Plan:**  Establish a clear communication plan for security incidents, including internal stakeholders and potentially external parties (customers, regulators) if necessary.

### 6. Conclusion

The "Trigger rebuild and deploy compromised assets" attack path represents a significant risk to Sage/Roots applications due to the reliance on automated deployment processes.  By understanding the steps involved, potential vulnerabilities, and impact, development teams can implement robust preventative, detective, and responsive security controls.  Prioritizing security throughout the entire CI/CD pipeline is crucial to protect the application and the organization from this high-risk attack vector.  Regularly reviewing and updating these security measures is essential to adapt to evolving threats and maintain a strong security posture.
