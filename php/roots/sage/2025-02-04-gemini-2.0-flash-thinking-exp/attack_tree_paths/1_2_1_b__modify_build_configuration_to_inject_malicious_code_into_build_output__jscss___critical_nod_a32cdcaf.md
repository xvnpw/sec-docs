### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1.b. Modify build configuration to inject malicious code into build output (JS/CSS)

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown: Modifying `bud.config.js`

* **`bud.config.js` Role in Sage/Bud.js:**  In a Sage project, `bud.config.js` is the central configuration file for Bud.js, the build tool used to compile and bundle assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.). It defines build pipelines, entry points, output paths, webpack configurations, and various build-time optimizations.
* **Attack Surface - Access to `bud.config.js`:**  For an attacker to modify `bud.config.js`, they need to gain unauthorized access to the development environment or the codebase repository. This could occur through various means:
    * **Compromised Developer Machine:**  If a developer's workstation is compromised (e.g., malware, phishing), an attacker could gain access to the local codebase and modify files.
    * **Compromised Version Control System (VCS):**  If the VCS (like Git/GitHub/GitLab) is compromised due to weak credentials, insider threat, or vulnerabilities, an attacker could directly modify the repository, including `bud.config.js`.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:**  Less directly, but potentially relevant, if a dependency used in the build process (e.g., a Bud.js plugin or a webpack loader) is compromised, it *could* indirectly influence the build output, although this specific attack path focuses on direct `bud.config.js` modification.
    * **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:** If the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious steps that modify `bud.config.js` or directly manipulate the build process.
* **Code Injection Techniques within `bud.config.js`:**  Once access is gained, attackers can inject malicious code in several ways through `bud.config.js`:
    * **Directly Injecting Malicious JavaScript/CSS:**
        * **Modifying Entry Points:**  Altering the entry points to include malicious JavaScript files or CSS files that are then processed and included in the final bundles.
        * **Adding Custom Build Steps:**  Using Bud.js's API to add custom build steps (e.g., using `bud.tap`, `bud.hooks`, or custom webpack plugins) that inject malicious code during the build process. This could involve manipulating files, adding inline scripts/styles, or modifying existing assets.
        * **Webpack Configuration Manipulation:**  Directly modifying the underlying webpack configuration (via `bud.webpackConfig`) to inject malicious code through webpack loaders, plugins, or by altering the compilation process. This is a powerful but potentially more complex method.
    * **Indirect Injection via Dependencies:**
        * While less direct to `bud.config.js` *modification*, an attacker could potentially introduce a malicious dependency (e.g., a compromised npm package) that is used within a custom build step defined in `bud.config.js`. This dependency could then inject malicious code during the build.

#### 4.2. Prerequisites for Successful Exploitation

For this attack path to be successful, the following prerequisites are generally necessary:

* **Access to the Development Environment or Codebase Repository:**  As outlined above, the attacker needs to gain access to modify the `bud.config.js` file.
* **Write Permissions to `bud.config.js`:**  The attacker's compromised account or access point must have sufficient permissions to modify the file within the file system or VCS.
* **Understanding of Sage/Bud.js Build Process (Basic):**  While deep expertise isn't always required, a basic understanding of how `bud.config.js` controls the build process in Sage/Bud.js is helpful for crafting effective injection techniques.
* **Lack of Security Controls:**  The attack is more likely to succeed if there are insufficient security controls in place, such as:
    * **Weak Access Control:**  Lack of strong authentication and authorization for development environments and VCS.
    * **Absence of Code Review:**  No or inadequate code review processes for changes to build configurations.
    * **Lack of Integrity Monitoring:**  No systems in place to detect unauthorized modifications to `bud.config.js` or build outputs.
    * **Insecure CI/CD Pipeline:**  Vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline that allow unauthorized modifications or injections.

#### 4.3. Step-by-Step Attack Scenario

1. **Initial Access:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine through malware, phishing, or social engineering. Alternatively, they compromise the VCS credentials or exploit a vulnerability in the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Locate `bud.config.js`:** The attacker navigates the codebase to locate the `bud.config.js` file, typically at the project root.
3. **Modify `bud.config.js`:** The attacker edits `bud.config.js` to inject malicious code. For example, they might add a custom build step using `bud.tap` to append malicious JavaScript to the main application JavaScript bundle:

   ```javascript
   // bud.config.js (Example of malicious modification)
   bud.tap(bud => {
       bud.hooks.on('build.done', stats => {
           const fs = require('fs');
           const mainJsPath = bud.path('dist', 'js', 'app.js'); // Assuming default output path
           const maliciousCode = ';alert("You have been hacked!");'; // Simple example
           fs.appendFileSync(mainJsPath, maliciousCode);
       });
   });
   ```

   Or they might directly modify webpack configuration to inject code:

   ```javascript
   // bud.config.js (Example of malicious webpack modification)
   bud.webpackConfig({
       plugins: [
           new class MaliciousPlugin {
               apply(compiler) {
                   compiler.hooks.emit.tapAsync('MaliciousPlugin', (compilation, callback) => {
                       const assetName = 'js/app.js'; // Assuming main JS bundle
                       if (compilation.assets[assetName]) {
                           const originalSource = compilation.assets[assetName].source();
                           const maliciousCode = ';alert("You have been hacked!");';
                           compilation.assets[assetName] = {
                               source: () => originalSource + maliciousCode,
                               size: () => (originalSource + maliciousCode).length,
                           };
                       }
                       callback();
                   });
               }
           }
       ]
   });
   ```

4. **Trigger Build Process:** The attacker commits and pushes the modified `bud.config.js` to the VCS, or manually triggers the build process locally or in the CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Malicious Code Injection:** Bud.js executes the build process, incorporating the malicious code as defined in the modified `bud.config.js` into the generated JavaScript and/or CSS assets.
6. **Deployment:** The compromised build output, containing the malicious code, is deployed to the production environment.
7. **Execution on Client-Side:** When users access the Sage application, their browsers download and execute the compromised JavaScript or CSS assets, leading to the execution of the injected malicious code. This could range from simple defacement (like the `alert()` example) to more sophisticated attacks like:
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Stealing user credentials, session tokens, or personal data.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting users to phishing pages or malware distribution sites.
    * **Cryptojacking:**  Using user's browser resources to mine cryptocurrency.
    * **Frontend-Driven Backend Exploitation:**  If the frontend interacts with backend APIs, malicious JavaScript could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the backend.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact

The impact of successfully injecting malicious code via `bud.config.js` can be severe and wide-ranging:

* **Frontend Compromise (XSS):**  The most direct impact is on the frontend of the application. Injected JavaScript can perform any action a legitimate script can, leading to:
    * **Data Theft:** Stealing user credentials, session cookies, personal information, form data, etc.
    * **Account Takeover:**  Using stolen credentials or session tokens to impersonate users.
    * **Website Defacement:**  Altering the visual appearance of the website to display malicious content or propaganda.
    * **Malware Distribution:**  Using the compromised website to distribute malware to visitors.
    * **Phishing Attacks:**  Creating fake login forms or other deceptive elements to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
* **Backend Compromise (Indirect):** While primarily a frontend attack vector, successful code injection can *indirectly* lead to backend compromise if:
    * **Frontend-Backend API Exploitation:** Malicious JavaScript could exploit vulnerabilities in backend APIs by sending crafted requests or manipulating data flow.
    * **Data Exfiltration from Backend:**  If the frontend has access to sensitive backend data (e.g., through APIs), malicious code could exfiltrate this data.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack leading to website defacement, data breaches, or malware distribution can severely damage the reputation and trust in the organization.
* **Financial Loss:**  Impacts can include direct financial losses due to data breaches, regulatory fines, incident response costs, and loss of customer trust and business.
* **Supply Chain Implications (If Build Output is Distributed):** If the compromised build output is further distributed (e.g., as part of a software library or a packaged application), the malicious code can propagate to downstream users and systems, amplifying the impact.

#### 4.5. Feasibility and Likelihood

The feasibility of this attack path is considered **HIGH** in environments with inadequate security controls.

* **Ease of Modification:** `bud.config.js` is a plain JavaScript file, easily modifiable if access is gained. Bud.js provides flexible APIs (hooks, webpack configuration) that make code injection relatively straightforward for someone familiar with JavaScript and build processes.
* **Potential for Stealth:**  Subtle code injections might be difficult to detect during casual code reviews, especially if obfuscated or designed to be triggered under specific conditions.
* **Common Vulnerabilities:**  Compromised developer machines, weak VCS security, and insecure CI/CD pipelines are common vulnerabilities in many organizations, making the initial access prerequisite achievable.
* **High Impact Justification:** As stated in the attack tree, the "High-Risk Path Justification" is valid due to the high impact of code injection directly into the deployed application, leading to widespread potential compromise.

However, the **likelihood** can be significantly reduced by implementing robust security measures (see Mitigation Strategies below).

#### 4.6. Detection Methods and Indicators of Compromise

Detecting this type of attack can be challenging but is crucial.  Methods include:

* **Code Review of `bud.config.js` and Build Scripts:**  Regular and thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on changes to `bud.config.js` and any custom build scripts, can identify suspicious modifications. Automated code review tools can also assist in detecting anomalies.
* **Version Control System Monitoring:**  Monitoring VCS logs for unauthorized or unexpected changes to `bud.config.js` and related build files. Alerting on modifications by non-authorized users or outside of expected workflows.
* **Static Analysis of Build Configurations:**  Using static analysis tools to scan `bud.config.js` and build scripts for potential code injection vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.
* **Build Output Integrity Checks:**
    * **Hashing/Checksums:**  Generating and storing checksums of the expected build outputs (JavaScript and CSS bundles). Regularly comparing the checksums of deployed assets against the stored values to detect unauthorized modifications.
    * **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Implementing SRI in HTML to ensure that browsers only execute scripts and stylesheets from trusted sources that have not been tampered with. While SRI primarily protects against CDN compromises, it can also help detect post-build modifications if implemented correctly and if the hashes are managed securely.
* **Security Scanning of Deployed Assets:**  Regularly scanning deployed JavaScript and CSS assets for malicious code patterns or anomalies using security scanners and vulnerability assessment tools.
* **Runtime Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:**  Monitoring the application's behavior in production for unexpected JavaScript execution, network requests to unusual domains, or other anomalous activities that could indicate injected malicious code.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) Monitoring:**  Implementing and monitoring CSP reports to detect violations that might indicate injected scripts attempting unauthorized actions.

**Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**

* **Unexpected Changes to `bud.config.js` in VCS logs.**
* **Unusual or unexplained build failures or errors.**
* **Changes in build output file sizes or checksums without corresponding code changes.**
* **Security scanner alerts for malicious code in deployed JavaScript or CSS assets.**
* **CSP violations reported from user browsers indicating unauthorized script execution.**
* **Anomalous network traffic originating from the application to unknown or suspicious domains.**
* **User reports of unexpected behavior, pop-ups, redirects, or security warnings when using the application.**

#### 4.7. Mitigation and Prevention Strategies

To effectively mitigate and prevent this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Secure Development Environment and Access Control:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant developers only the necessary permissions to access and modify codebase and build configurations.
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control (RBAC) for development environments, VCS, and CI/CD pipelines.
    * **Regular Security Audits of Access Controls:**  Periodically review and audit access permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and secure.
* **Code Review and Version Control for `bud.config.js`:**
    * **Mandatory Code Review:**  Implement mandatory code review processes for all changes to `bud.config.js` and related build scripts. Ensure reviewers have security awareness and are trained to identify potential injection points.
    * **Version Control and History Tracking:**  Utilize a robust VCS (like Git) to track all changes to `bud.config.js`, allowing for easy rollback and auditing.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization in Build Scripts (If Applicable):**  If `bud.config.js` or custom build scripts take any external input (e.g., environment variables, command-line arguments), ensure proper validation and sanitization to prevent injection vulnerabilities within the build process itself.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by restricting the capabilities of injected scripts.
* **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Implement SRI for all external JavaScript and CSS resources loaded by the application. This ensures that browsers verify the integrity of fetched resources and prevent execution if they have been tampered with.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically including assessments of the build pipeline and configuration files like `bud.config.js`, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * **Harden CI/CD Infrastructure:**  Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure itself, including build servers, agents, and orchestration tools.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for CI/CD:**  Grant CI/CD processes only the necessary permissions. Avoid running build processes with overly permissive accounts.
    * **Immutable Build Environments:**  Use immutable build environments (e.g., containerized builds) to ensure consistency and prevent build-time modifications.
    * **Secure Dependency Management in CI/CD:**  Implement secure dependency management practices within the CI/CD pipeline, including dependency scanning and vulnerability checks.
* **Dependency Management and Vulnerability Scanning:**
    * **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Keep Bud.js, webpack, and all other build dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:**  Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning tools into the development and CI/CD pipelines to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
    * **Lock Dependencies:**  Use package lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments and prevent unexpected dependency updates that could introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Principle of Least Functionality in Build Process:**  Avoid adding unnecessary complexity or custom build steps to `bud.config.js`. Keep the build process as simple and auditable as possible.

#### 4.8. Sage/Bud.js Specific Considerations

* **Bud.js Extensibility:** Bud.js is designed to be extensible through hooks and webpack configuration. While this flexibility is powerful, it also increases the attack surface if not managed securely. Be cautious when adding custom build steps or modifying webpack configurations, and ensure they are thoroughly reviewed for security implications.
* **Sage Best Practices:**  Adhere to Sage's recommended development practices and security guidelines. Stay updated with Sage security advisories and updates.
* **Community Resources:** Leverage the Sage community and Bud.js documentation for security best practices and examples related to build configuration and security hardening.

### 5. Conclusion

Modifying `bud.config.js` to inject malicious code is a **critical** and **high-risk** attack path in Sage applications.  Successful exploitation can lead to severe frontend compromise (XSS), potential backend implications, and significant business impact.

However, by implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, including strong access controls, code review, build output integrity checks, CSP, SRI, and secure CI/CD practices, the likelihood and impact of this attack can be significantly reduced.

The development team should prioritize implementing these security measures to protect their Sage application and users from this critical vulnerability. Regular security assessments and ongoing vigilance are essential to maintain a secure build process and application.
