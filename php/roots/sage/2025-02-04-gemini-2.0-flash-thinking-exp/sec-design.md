# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the Github repository roots/sage, is a WordPress starter theme aimed at providing a more streamlined and modern development experience for building WordPress themes.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance WordPress theme development efficiency and developer experience.
  - Promote modern web development practices within the WordPress ecosystem.
  - Provide a robust and well-structured foundation for building high-quality WordPress themes.
  - Foster a community around modern WordPress theme development.
  - Enable developers to create performant and maintainable WordPress themes.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in themes built using Sage, potentially stemming from the framework itself or developer misuse.
  - Compatibility issues with future WordPress core updates, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates to Sage.
  - Developer adoption rate might be lower than expected if the learning curve is too steep or if it doesn't adequately address developer needs.
  - Community support might be insufficient, leading to slower issue resolution and less overall project robustness.
  - Performance bottlenecks introduced by the framework itself, negating the goal of performant themes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency management using `composer` and `npm` to manage third-party libraries (described in `composer.json` and `package.json`).
  - security control: Use of a templating engine (Blade) which can help mitigate some output encoding vulnerabilities (implicitly implemented in the framework).
  - security control: WordPress coding standards and best practices are generally encouraged (implicitly through the framework structure and community guidelines).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on WordPress core security. Sage themes operate within the WordPress environment and inherit the security posture of WordPress itself.
  - accepted risk: Security of third-party dependencies. Sage relies on external libraries managed by `composer` and `npm`, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a potential risk.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning of dependencies using tools like `npm audit` and `composer audit` in the build process.
  - security control: Introduce static application security testing (SAST) tools to scan the Sage codebase and example themes for potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities within the Sage project.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers building themes with Sage, focusing on common WordPress security pitfalls.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Themes built with Sage operate within the WordPress authentication context. Theme code should not implement its own authentication mechanisms but rely on WordPress's built-in authentication.
  - Authorization:
    - Themes should respect WordPress's role-based authorization system. Theme functionality should be designed to align with WordPress user roles and capabilities.
  - Input Validation:
    - All user inputs handled by themes built with Sage must be properly validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (if themes directly interact with the database, which is generally discouraged in WordPress theme development). This should be implemented within theme code built using Sage.
  - Cryptography:
    - Themes should leverage HTTPS for all communication. Sensitive data handling within themes should adhere to cryptographic best practices, although themes typically should not handle highly sensitive data directly. If themes need to store or transmit sensitive data, proper encryption methods should be employed, ideally leveraging WordPress APIs where available.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and release of secure and functional WordPress themes using Sage.
  - Maintaining the Sage framework to be compatible with WordPress and modern web standards.
  - Community adoption and trust in Sage as a reliable theme development framework.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Sage codebase itself (intellectual property, project integrity). Sensitivity: High (integrity, availability).
  - Themes built with Sage (customer projects, potential vulnerabilities). Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the theme's purpose and data handling).
  - User data within WordPress instances using Sage-based themes (if themes handle user data). Sensitivity: High (confidentiality, integrity, availability, depending on data type).
  - Build artifacts (theme files). Sensitivity: Medium (integrity, availability).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended target audience for Sage in terms of company size and risk appetite? (Startup, Fortune 500, individual developers?)
  - Are there specific compliance requirements that themes built with Sage need to adhere to (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS)?
  - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Sage and themes built with it?
  - Are there any existing security scanning or testing practices in place for Sage development?
  - What are the typical deployment environments for themes built with Sage? (Shared hosting, VPS, cloud platforms?)

- Assumptions:
  - Sage is primarily used by WordPress developers to build custom themes for various clients or projects.
  - Security is a concern for projects built with Sage, but the level of security required may vary depending on the project and client.
  - Deployment environments are diverse, ranging from shared hosting to more managed environments.
  - The focus is on providing a secure foundation for theme development, but developers are ultimately responsible for the security of the themes they build using Sage.
  - The project aims for a balance between developer experience and security.
