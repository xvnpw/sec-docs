# Attack Surface Analysis for roots/sage

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Node.js Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_node_js_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Sage relies on Node.js and npm/Yarn, introducing a dependency chain. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies used in Sage's build process can be exploited.
*   **Sage Contribution:** Sage's `package.json` defines numerous dependencies required for development and build processes. Outdated or vulnerable packages here directly affect the application's security posture *due to Sage's tooling*.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a Webpack loader used by Sage's build process. An attacker could craft a malicious file that, when processed during the build, executes arbitrary code on the developer's machine or build server.
*   **Impact:**  Supply chain attacks, arbitrary code execution, compromised build process, potential for backdoored builds.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Node.js dependencies using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipelines to detect vulnerabilities early.
    *   Use dependency lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for Node.js and key dependencies used by Sage.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection via Blade Misuse](./attack_surfaces/template_injection_via_blade_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** While Blade templating engine is designed to be safer than raw PHP, improper use within Sage themes can still lead to template injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Sage Contribution:** Sage *mandates* the use of Blade as its templating engine. Developers working with Sage *must* use Blade, and misuse within Blade templates is a direct consequence of using Sage's chosen templating system.
*   **Example:** A developer uses user-supplied data directly within a `@php` directive in a Blade template within a Sage theme without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious PHP code through user input, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and validate user input before using it in Blade templates within Sage themes.
    *   Adhere to secure coding practices for Blade templating, utilizing Blade's escaping mechanisms.
    *   Avoid using `@php` directives for complex logic in Blade templates and favor Blade components and controllers for better security and structure within Sage themes.
    *   Conduct code reviews specifically looking for potential template injection vulnerabilities in Blade templates within Sage themes.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**  Configuration files, especially `.env` files commonly used in Sage projects for environment variables, can contain sensitive information. Accidental public exposure of these files is a critical risk.
*   **Sage Contribution:** Sage projects *often* utilize `.env` files (or similar mechanisms) for environment configuration as part of its modern development approach.  Incorrect deployment practices in Sage projects can lead to these files being publicly accessible.
*   **Example:** A developer deploys a Sage theme and forgets to exclude the `.env` file from the web server's public directory. An attacker accesses the `.env` file directly via a web request and obtains database credentials, API keys, or other secrets used by the Sage-based application.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data, potential compromise of databases, external services, and the application itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure proper `.gitignore` configuration in Sage projects to exclude sensitive files like `.env` from version control and deployments.
    *   Configure web servers hosting Sage applications to prevent direct access to configuration files and directories (e.g., using `.htaccess` or server block configurations).
    *   Store sensitive information securely using environment variables and secure vault solutions instead of directly in configuration files whenever possible in Sage projects.
