## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_attack_vector_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Targeting the software build process, which in Sage's case involves Node.js, npm/yarn, and Bud.js.
    * **Critical Node Justification:**  Compromising the build process allows for injecting malicious code early in the application lifecycle, making it harder to detect and potentially impacting all deployments.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_attack_vector_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party npm/yarn packages used by Sage and the application.
        * **Critical Node Justification:**  Sage projects rely heavily on dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a common and easily exploitable attack surface.

* **Attack Vector:** Modifying `bud.config.js` to inject malicious JavaScript or CSS code into the application's assets during the build process (e.g., by adding custom build steps, modifying webpack configurations).
                * **Critical Node Justification:** Code injection directly into application assets is a highly effective way to compromise the application's frontend and potentially backend.
                * **High-Risk Path Justification:** High impact as it leads to malicious code in the deployed application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.b.i. Trigger rebuild and deploy compromised assets [HIGH-RISK PATH END]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_b_i__trigger_rebuild_and_deploy_compromised_assets__high-risk_path_end_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Misusing the Blade templating engine, specifically through Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).
        * **Critical Node Justification:** Blade is a core component of Sage for rendering dynamic content. Misuse can lead to direct server-side code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Blade [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type] [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_blade__critical_node_-_vulnerability_type___high-risk_a9a18411.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Server-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities in Blade templates by injecting malicious Blade syntax into user-controlled input that is directly rendered without proper escaping.
            * **Critical Node Justification:** SSTI is a well-known and critical vulnerability type in template engines.
