# Threat Model Analysis for roots/sage

## Threat: [Vulnerable Node.js Packages](./threats/vulnerable_node_js_packages.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in Node.js packages used by Sage (directly or transitively). They might use publicly available exploits or develop custom exploits. This could be achieved by targeting outdated packages or packages with known security flaws.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or developer machine, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the frontend assets, Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure (e.g., leaking server-side code or data).

**Affected Sage Component:** `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, Node.js dependency management, build process.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and exploitability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Node.js and npm/yarn to the latest stable versions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify and remediate vulnerable packages.
*   Implement a process for monitoring and patching dependency vulnerabilities.
*   Use `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Composer Packages](./threats/vulnerable_composer_packages.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in PHP packages managed by Composer, used by Sage. Similar to Node.js packages, attackers can target outdated or vulnerable Composer dependencies.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, Local File Inclusion (LFI), SQL Injection (if vulnerable packages interact with the database), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.

**Affected Sage Component:** `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, Composer dependency management, backend PHP code.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and exploitability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Composer to the latest stable version.
*   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `composer audit`, SensioLabs Security Checker, Roave Security Advisories) to identify and remediate vulnerable packages.
*   Implement a process for monitoring and patching dependency vulnerabilities.
*   Use `composer.lock` to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on npm/Composer Repositories](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_npmcomposer_repositories.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise npm or Composer repositories or utilize typosquatting to distribute malicious packages. Developers unknowingly install these compromised packages as dependencies in their Sage projects.

**Impact:** Backdoor installation in the application, data theft, website defacement, compromised server infrastructure, Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Affected Sage Component:** `package.json`, `composer.json`, dependency installation process, build process.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (due to wide potential impact and difficulty in detection).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use reputable package registries and verify package sources when possible.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools that can detect suspicious package behavior.
*   Regularly review project dependencies and remove any unnecessary packages.
*   Consider using private package registries for internal dependencies to reduce reliance on public repositories.

## Threat: [Exposure of Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** Environment variables containing sensitive information (database credentials, API keys, secrets) are improperly handled or exposed. This could be through insecure storage in `.env` files committed to version control, misconfigured server environments, or logging environment variables.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure (database credentials, API keys, secrets), unauthorized access to resources, compromised accounts.

**Affected Sage Component:** `.env` files (if used), server environment configuration, application bootstrapping, logging mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High (due to direct exposure of sensitive credentials).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never commit `.env` files containing sensitive information to version control.
*   Use secure methods for managing environment variables in production (e.g., server environment variables, secret management services).
*   Ensure proper file permissions on `.env` files in development environments.
*   Avoid logging environment variables, especially in production.

## Threat: [Compromised Development Environment](./threats/compromised_development_environment.md)

**Description:** A developer's machine used for Sage development is compromised by malware or attackers. This allows attackers to inject malicious code, manipulate dependencies, steal sensitive information, or compromise build artifacts.

**Impact:** Code injection into the Sage project, supply chain compromise, data theft, compromised build artifacts, Remote Code Execution (RCE) on developer machines and potentially production servers.

**Affected Sage Component:** Development environment, codebase, build process, version control system.

**Risk Severity:** High (due to potential for wide-ranging impact).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust security practices for developer machines (antivirus, firewalls, strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, regular updates).
*   Educate developers on security best practices and secure coding principles.
*   Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions on developer machines.
*   Enforce least privilege access for developer accounts.
*   Isolate development environments using virtualization or containerization.
