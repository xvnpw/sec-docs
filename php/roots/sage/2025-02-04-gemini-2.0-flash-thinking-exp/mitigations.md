# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for roots/sage

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `bud.config.js` Configuration Review and Hardening (Sage Build Process)](./mitigation_strategies/secure__bud_config_js__configuration_review_and_hardening__sage_build_process_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly review the `bud.config.js` file located in the root directory of your Sage theme. This file is central to configuring Bud.js, Sage's build tool powered by Webpack, and misconfigurations here can introduce security vulnerabilities specific to how Sage builds and serves assets.
    2.  **Minimize Publicly Accessible Output Paths (Sage Assets):** Carefully examine the `bud.setPath()` configuration within `bud.config.js`. Ensure that the defined output paths, particularly the `public` path, correctly direct compiled assets to the intended public web server directories. Prevent accidental exposure of sensitive files or directories through misconfigured output paths in your Sage build process. Verify that only necessary public assets are placed in the publicly accessible `public` directory.
    3.  **Sanitize Build Inputs (Sage Build Context):** If your `bud.config.js` utilizes external data or user-provided input during the Sage build process (for example, environment variables used in asset processing or dynamic configuration loading), rigorously sanitize and validate this input. This is crucial to prevent potential injection attacks that could execute malicious code during Sage's build phase, compromising the build environment or the resulting theme assets.
    4.  **Disable Unnecessary Bud.js Features (Sage Build Optimization):** Review the Bud.js configuration within `bud.config.js` and disable any Bud.js features, plugins, or loaders that are not strictly required for your Sage theme's functionality. Reducing the complexity of the build process minimizes the potential attack surface inherent in the Sage build pipeline.
    5.  **Secure Source Maps in Production (Sage Development Artifacts):** If source maps are enabled in your `bud.config.js` for development debugging (using `bud.devtool()`), ensure these are explicitly disabled or not accessible in production deployments of your Sage theme. Source maps can reveal your original source code, potentially exposing sensitive logic or implementation details. Configure your web server to prevent public access to source map files if they are inadvertently included in production builds.
    6.  **Keep Bud.js and Sage Build Toolchain Updated:** Regularly update the `@roots/bud` package and its related dependencies, including Webpack and any loaders or plugins configured in `bud.config.js`. These updates often include security patches and bug fixes for the underlying build tools used by Sage, ensuring your build process remains secure.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via Sage Assets (Medium Severity):** Misconfiguration in `bud.config.js` leading to unintended public exposure of sensitive files or source code through Sage's compiled assets.
        *   **Build-Time Injection Attacks in Sage Build (Medium Severity):** Vulnerabilities arising from processing unsanitized external input within `bud.config.js`, potentially allowing malicious code execution during the Sage theme's build process.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via Sage Assets:** Moderate impact - reduces the risk of unintentional data leaks specific to Sage theme assets by ensuring secure build output configuration.
        *   **Build-Time Injection Attacks in Sage Build:** Moderate impact - mitigates the risk of build-time code injection within the Sage build process through secure configuration practices.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers configure `bud.config.js` for Sage theme functionality, but security hardening of the build process might not be a primary or consistently applied focus.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Security Checklist for `bud.config.js` (Sage Specific):**  Lack of a documented, Sage-specific security checklist for developers to systematically review `bud.config.js` for potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations related to the Sage build process.
        *   **Automated `bud.config.js` Security Scanning (Sage Context):** Absence of automated tools or scripts specifically designed to scan `bud.config.js` for security issues or deviations from Sage-specific security best practices in build configuration.
        *   **Production Source Map Management (Sage Deployment):** Potential lack of explicit configuration or procedures to effectively disable or restrict access to source maps in production deployments of Sage themes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Blade Template Output Escaping and Secure Directives Usage (Sage Templating)](./mitigation_strategies/blade_template_output_escaping_and_secure_directives_usage__sage_templating_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Default Blade Escaping (Sage Templates):**  Strictly adhere to Blade's default output escaping mechanism (`{{ $variable }}`) within all Sage theme templates. This is crucial for rendering dynamic content, especially user-generated data or external source information, and automatically escapes HTML entities to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within Sage themes.
    2.  **Context-Aware Escaping in Blade (Sage Rendering):**  Be acutely aware of different escaping contexts when using Blade in Sage. When outputting data within HTML attributes, JavaScript code blocks, or URLs within Sage templates, utilize context-appropriate escaping functions or Blade directives if the default `{{ }}` is insufficient. Leverage Blade's built-in directives like `e()` (HTML escaping), `@json()` (JSON escaping for JavaScript within Sage views), and URL encoding functions as needed to ensure context-sensitive security in Sage template rendering.
    3.  **Minimize Un-escaped Output (`{!! !!}`) in Sage Themes:**  Severely restrict the use of un-escaped output directives (`{!! $variable !!}`) in Sage templates. Only employ this directive when absolutely necessary and when you possess complete certainty that the content being output is inherently safe and originates exclusively from trusted sources. If un-escaped output is unavoidable in a Sage template, rigorously sanitize and validate the data *before* it is passed to the Blade view. Thoroughly document the justification for using un-escaped output and detail the sanitization measures implemented within the Sage theme.
    4.  **Avoid `@php` Blocks for Output in Blade (Sage Logic Separation):**  Minimize the use of `@php` blocks within Sage Blade templates, particularly for generating output. Logic and data preparation for Sage views should ideally be handled within WordPress controllers, view composers, or dedicated PHP functions. Only pass safe, pre-processed data to Blade for rendering. If `@php` blocks are used for output in Sage templates, ensure meticulous output escaping within these blocks.
    5.  **Template Injection Prevention in Sage (Blade Paths):**  Absolutely prohibit the dynamic construction of Blade template paths based on user input within your Sage theme. This practice can introduce severe template injection vulnerabilities. Always utilize static template paths or select from a predefined, secure set of allowed template paths when rendering views in your Sage application.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Sage Themes (High Severity):** Improper or absent output escaping in Sage Blade templates is a primary source of XSS vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users of your Sage-powered website.
        *   **Template Injection in Sage (High Severity):**  Dynamically constructing template paths based on user input within Sage themes can lead to template injection, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting your Sage application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Sage Themes:** High impact - significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities within Sage themes by enforcing robust output escaping practices in Blade templates.
        *   **Template Injection in Sage:** High impact - eliminates the risk of template injection vulnerabilities in Sage themes by preventing dynamic template path construction.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers generally understand Blade escaping within Sage, but consistent and context-aware escaping across all theme templates may not be universally enforced. Un-escaped output might be used without complete awareness of the associated risks in Sage themes.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Code Review Focus on Blade Escaping (Sage Themes):**  Code review processes for Sage themes may not explicitly prioritize the verification of proper Blade output escaping in all templates, especially for complex or dynamically generated content within Sage views.
        *   **Static Analysis for Blade Templates (Sage Specific):** Lack of static analysis tools specifically tailored to detect potential XSS vulnerabilities within Sage Blade templates (e.g., identifying un-escaped output or misuse of directives in Sage theme code).
        *   **Developer Training on Secure Blade Templating (Sage Context):**  Absence of formal training or specific guidelines for developers on secure Blade templating practices within the Sage framework, including context-aware escaping and avoiding unsafe directives in Sage themes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Sage Theme Updates (Sage Framework Maintenance)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_sage_theme_updates__sage_framework_maintenance_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a consistent process for regularly checking for and applying updates specifically to the Roots Sage theme itself.
    2.  Actively monitor the official Roots blog, the Sage GitHub repository, and any relevant security mailing lists or channels for announcements regarding new Sage releases, security patches, and vulnerability disclosures that are specific to the Sage framework.
    3.  Utilize `composer update roots/sage` to update the core Sage theme files and PHP dependencies. This command is essential for keeping the Sage framework itself secure and up-to-date.
    4.  After updating the Sage theme, thoroughly test your entire application to ensure compatibility with the new Sage version and to verify that no regressions or new issues have been introduced into your Sage-based website. It is strongly recommended to perform this testing in a dedicated staging environment that mirrors your production setup before deploying updates to the live production site.
    5.  Schedule regular update cycles (e.g., monthly or quarterly) specifically for the Sage theme. Proactive and timely updates are critical for applying security patches released by the Roots team and for benefiting from bug fixes and improvements incorporated into newer versions of the Sage framework.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Sage Theme (High Severity):**  Exploitation of security vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched within the Roots Sage theme code itself. Failure to update Sage promptly leaves your application vulnerable to these known exploits.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Sage Theme:** High impact - directly addresses and mitigates vulnerabilities present within the Sage theme framework itself by applying official patches and updates provided by the Roots team.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely inconsistently implemented. Developers may update the Sage theme occasionally, but a formalized, scheduled update process specifically for Sage might be lacking.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Scheduled Sage Theme Update Process:** Lack of a clearly defined schedule and documented procedure for regularly checking and applying updates specifically to the Roots Sage theme.
        *   **Sage Update Monitoring and Alerting:** Absence of a system to automatically monitor for new Sage theme releases and security updates and to proactively alert developers when updates are available, particularly for critical security patches related to Sage.
        *   **Testing and Staging Environment for Sage Updates:**  Sage theme updates might be applied directly to production environments without adequate prior testing in a staging environment, significantly increasing the risk of introducing regressions, breaking changes, or unforeseen issues into the live Sage-powered website.
