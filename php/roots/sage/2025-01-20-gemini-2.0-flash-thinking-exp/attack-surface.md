# Attack Surface Analysis for roots/sage

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Blade Templates](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_blade_templates.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template directives, which is then executed on the server.
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** Sage utilizes the Blade templating engine, which, if not used carefully, can be vulnerable to SSTI if user-supplied data is directly embedded within Blade directives without proper sanitization.
    *   **Example:**  A form field value is directly used within a Blade `@php` directive: `@php echo $_GET['name']; @endphp`. An attacker could input `<?php system('rm -rf /'); ?>` as the name, potentially leading to severe consequences.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always sanitize user input:**  Escape or sanitize any user-provided data before using it within Blade directives.
        *   **Avoid direct execution of user input:**  Minimize the use of `@php` directives with user-controlled data.
        *   **Utilize Blade's built-in escaping mechanisms:**  Leverage features like `{{ $variable }}` for automatic escaping of output.
        *   **Regular security audits:** Review Blade templates for potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Node.js Packages (Webpack/Yarn)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_node_js_packages__webpackyarn_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in the Node.js packages used by Sage for asset management (via Webpack and Yarn).
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** Sage's build process relies heavily on Node.js packages managed by Yarn. Introducing numerous dependencies increases the potential for including vulnerable packages.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in a popular Webpack loader used by Sage. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses the affected version.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update dependencies:** Use `yarn upgrade` or similar commands to keep all Node.js packages up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Utilize vulnerability scanning tools:** Integrate tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` into the development workflow to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Review dependency tree:** Understand the dependencies being used, including transitive dependencies, to identify potential risks.
        *   **Consider using a dependency management tool with security features:** Some tools offer features to block known vulnerable packages.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks on Node.js Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_on_node_js_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious actors compromise legitimate Node.js packages used by Sage, injecting malicious code.
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** By relying on a large number of external Node.js packages, Sage increases the attack surface for supply chain attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains control of a popular Webpack plugin used by Sage and injects code that exfiltrates sensitive data during the build process.
    *   **Impact:**  Introduction of malware, data theft, compromised build artifacts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pin dependency versions:** Avoid using wildcard version ranges in `package.json` to ensure consistent and predictable dependency versions.
        *   **Verify package integrity:** Use checksums or other methods to verify the integrity of downloaded packages.
        *   **Monitor for suspicious activity:**  Be vigilant for unusual behavior in the build process or in the application after deployment.
        *   **Consider using a private registry:** For sensitive projects, using a private registry can provide more control over the packages used.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Bud CLI](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_bud_cli.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands into parameters used by the Bud CLI.
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** Sage utilizes the Bud CLI for various development tasks. If user input is incorporated into Bud CLI commands without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **Example:** A custom Bud command takes user input for a file path. An attacker could input `; rm -rf /` to execute a dangerous command on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using user input directly in Bud CLI commands:** If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize user input before incorporating it into commands.
        *   **Use parameterized commands or APIs:** If possible, use safer alternatives to directly constructing shell commands.
        *   **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure the user running Bud CLI commands has only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data (API keys, database credentials, etc.) is stored insecurely in configuration files.
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** Sage uses configuration files (e.g., within the `config/` directory) to manage application settings. If these files are not properly secured, they can become a target for attackers.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials are hardcoded in `config/database.php` and are accessible if the web server configuration is incorrect or if there's a file inclusion vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Utilize environment variables:** Store sensitive information in environment variables instead of directly in configuration files.
        *   **Secure file permissions:** Ensure that configuration files have appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   **Avoid committing sensitive data to version control:** Use `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to prevent sensitive configuration files from being committed to Git repositories.
        *   **Encrypt sensitive configuration data:** If environment variables are not feasible, consider encrypting sensitive data within configuration files.
