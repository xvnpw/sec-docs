# Attack Tree Analysis for roots/sage

Objective: Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access or control over the application or its data by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Sage theme framework itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

            * Exploit Deployment Process [CRITICAL NODE]
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Sage Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_sage_application__critical_node_.md)

**1. Compromise Sage Application [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security, potentially leading to data theft, service disruption, or other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**2. Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* This path focuses on compromising the process used to build and package the application. If successful, attackers can inject malicious code that will be present in every deployment of the application.
    * **Exploit Dependency Management [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Introduce Malicious Dependency:**
            * **Supply Chain Attack (e.g., typosquatting on npm/yarn):** Attackers publish malicious packages with names similar to legitimate ones, hoping developers will accidentally install them. This injects malicious code into the project during dependency installation.
        * **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Attackers identify and exploit known security flaws in outdated or vulnerable npm/yarn packages used by the Sage theme.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Templating Engine (Blade) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_templating_engine__blade__vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**3. Exploit Templating Engine (Blade) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This path targets vulnerabilities within Blade, the templating engine used by Sage. Successful exploitation can lead to direct code execution on the server.
    * **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** Attackers inject malicious code into Blade templates through user input or data stored in the database that is not properly sanitized before being rendered. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Pipeline Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_pipeline_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**4. Exploit Asset Pipeline Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* This path focuses on vulnerabilities in how Sage handles and processes assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images.
    * **Inject Malicious Assets [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * Attackers upload or inject malicious files (e.g., JavaScript with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads) into the application's asset directories. These malicious assets can then be served to users, allowing the attacker to execute scripts in their browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration and Environment Variables [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_and_environment_variables__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**5. Exploit Configuration and Environment Variables [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This path targets the application's configuration, which often contains sensitive information.
    * **Access Sensitive Configuration Files:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to files like `.env` that store sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. This access can lead to further compromise of the application and its associated services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Development and Deployment Practices [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_development_and_deployment_practices__high-risk_path_.md)

**6. Exploit Development and Deployment Practices [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

* This path focuses on weaknesses in the processes used to develop and deploy the application.
    * **Access Development/Staging Environments [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit weaker security measures in development or staging environments to gain access. This access can then be used to gather information or potentially pivot to the production environment.
    * **Exploit Version Control System (Git) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Git repository, potentially exposing sensitive information, including credentials or vulnerabilities in the code. They might also introduce malicious code directly into the repository.
    * **Exploit Deployment Process [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers intercept or manipulate the deployment process to inject malicious code into the application during deployment. This allows them to compromise the production environment directly.
