# Threat Model Analysis for roots/sage

## Threat: [Malicious Build Script Injection](./threats/malicious_build_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the development environment or CI/CD pipeline and modifies build scripts (e.g., within `package.json` or Webpack configuration files) that are part of the Sage framework's structure. This allows them to inject malicious code that gets executed during the build process, embedding it into the final theme assets generated by Sage.
*   **Impact:**  Injection of malicious code into the front-end assets, leading to XSS attacks, redirection to malicious sites, or client-side data theft for users of the Sage-based theme. Potentially, server-side code could also be injected if the build process involves server-side actions within the Sage context.
*   **Affected Component:** `package.json` (specifically scripts section), `webpack.config.js` (within the Sage theme), any custom build scripts integrated with Sage's build process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure access to the development environment and CI/CD pipeline with strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Implement code reviews for changes to build scripts within the Sage theme.
    *   Use version control for build scripts and track changes.
    *   Consider using a secure build environment with restricted access.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Blade Directive](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_blade_directive.md)

*   **Description:** A developer improperly handles user-supplied data within a Blade template, a core component of the Sage framework's templating system, directly passing unsanitized input to a Blade directive that allows code execution. An attacker could then craft malicious input that, when rendered by the Blade engine, executes arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the Sage-based WordPress site, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and defacement of the website.
*   **Affected Component:** Blade templates (`.blade.php` files) within the Sage theme structure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and escape user input before rendering it in Blade templates.
    *   Avoid directly using user input in potentially dangerous Blade directives without proper validation and sanitization.
    *   Implement input validation on the server-side before passing data to Blade templates.
    *   Regularly review Blade templates for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Development Information within Sage Theme Files](./threats/exposure_of_development_information_within_sage_theme_files.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might leave debugging code, comments containing sensitive information, or development-specific configurations within the Sage theme's files (e.g., Blade templates, JavaScript files) that are accidentally deployed to the production environment. An attacker could then access these files and glean sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially revealing API keys, internal logic, or other sensitive details that could aid in further attacks against the Sage-based application.
*   **Affected Component:** Any file within the Sage theme directory, including Blade templates (`.blade.php`), JavaScript files (`.js`), and CSS files (`.css`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium  *(While the impact can be high depending on the information, the direct exploitability is often slightly lower than RCE)*
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement thorough code reviews before deployment to remove debugging code and sensitive comments.
    *   Use a build process that strips out development-specific code and comments for production deployments.
    *   Ensure proper file permissions are set on the production server to restrict access to theme files.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vulnerable Front-End Asset within Sage Theme](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_vulnerable_front-end_asset_within_sage_theme.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in a custom JavaScript or CSS file specifically within the Sage theme's `resources/scripts` or `resources/styles` directories. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into the website, which are then executed in the browsers of other users interacting with the Sage-based theme.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom JavaScript files (e.g., in `resources/scripts`), custom CSS files (e.g., in `resources/styles`) within the Sage theme.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing JavaScript and CSS within the Sage theme.
    *   Sanitize and escape user-generated content displayed on the front-end using the theme's output mechanisms.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
    *   Regularly review and test front-end code within the Sage theme for potential vulnerabilities.
