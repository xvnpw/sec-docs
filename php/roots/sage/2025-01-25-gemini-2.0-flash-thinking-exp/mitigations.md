## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Output Escaping in Blade Templates (Sage Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_output_escaping_in_blade_templates__sage_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Secure Templating Practices within Sage's Blade Engine.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sage Blade Template Review:**  Specifically audit all `.blade.php` files within your Sage theme for potential output of user-supplied data. Focus on areas where dynamic data is rendered using Blade syntax.
    2.  **Utilize Blade's Escaping:**  Ensure consistent use of Blade's default escaping `{{ $variable }}` for all dynamic content originating from user input, WordPress database, or external sources within your Sage templates.
    3.  **Cautious Raw Output:**  Minimize and carefully review any usage of `{!! $variable !!}` for raw HTML output in Blade templates.  If used, rigorously verify the source of the data and ensure it is absolutely trusted and sanitized *before* being passed to the Blade template.  Prefer safer alternatives if possible.
    4.  **Sage Development Training:**  Train developers specifically on secure Blade templating within the Sage context, emphasizing the importance of escaping and the risks of raw output. Include code examples and best practices relevant to Sage's structure.
    5.  **Sage Code Style Guide:**  Incorporate secure Blade templating practices into your project's code style guide and enforce them through code reviews and potentially linters configured for Blade syntax.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Blade Templates - High Severity:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts through user input that is not properly escaped when rendered by Blade, leading to account compromise, data theft, and other XSS-related attacks within the Sage-powered frontend.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS Mitigation in Sage - High Impact:** Directly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from insecure use of Blade templates within the Sage theme, protecting the frontend user experience.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic Blade Escaping Awareness (Partially Implemented):** Developers using Sage are generally aware of Blade's `{{ }}` escaping, but consistent and thorough application across all templates and contexts might be lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Sage-Specific Training:** Lack of focused training on secure Blade practices *within the context of Sage theme development*.
    *   **Sage Code Style Enforcement:**  Absence of specific code style guidelines and automated checks to enforce secure Blade templating within the Sage project.
    *   **Raw Output Auditing in Sage:**  No systematic auditing process to identify and review instances of `{!! $variable !!}` usage in Sage templates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sage Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (Composer & Yarn/NPM)](./mitigation_strategies/sage_dependency_vulnerability_scanning__composer_&_yarnnpm_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Automate Vulnerability Scanning for Sage's PHP and JavaScript Dependencies.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sage Project Scan Configuration:** Configure dependency scanning tools (like `composer audit`, `npm audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check) specifically for your Sage project's `composer.json` and `package.json` files.
    2.  **CI/CD Integration for Sage Builds:** Integrate these scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys your Sage theme. Ensure scans are performed on every build.
    3.  **Sage Dependency Thresholds:** Set vulnerability severity thresholds relevant to your Sage project's risk profile. Configure alerts to notify the development team specifically for vulnerabilities found in Sage's dependencies.
    4.  **Sage Build Failure Policy:**  Implement a policy to fail the Sage theme build process if vulnerabilities exceeding a defined severity level are detected in its dependencies. This prevents deploying vulnerable Sage themes.
    5.  **Sage Dependency Update Workflow:** Establish a clear workflow for addressing vulnerabilities identified in Sage's dependencies, including prioritization, patching, and testing within the Sage theme context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Sage Theme - High to Critical Severity:** Exploits in third-party PHP and JavaScript libraries used by Sage and its required dependencies. These vulnerabilities can directly impact the security of the Sage theme and the WordPress site it powers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sage Dependency Security - High Impact:** Proactively identifies and mitigates known vulnerabilities within the dependency chain of the Sage theme, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation through compromised libraries.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Manual Dependency Checks (Potentially Implemented):** Developers might occasionally manually run `composer audit` or `npm audit` within the Sage theme directory, but this is not automated or consistently enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Sage Dependency Scanning in CI/CD:** Lack of automated vulnerability scanning integrated into the CI/CD pipeline specifically for the Sage theme build process.
    *   **Sage-Specific Alerting and Build Failure:** No automated alerts and build failure mechanisms tailored to vulnerabilities found in Sage's dependencies.
    *   **Dedicated Sage Dependency Update Workflow:** Absence of a defined and enforced workflow for managing and updating vulnerable dependencies within the Sage theme project.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `.env` File Management for Sage Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure___env__file_management_for_sage_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Secure Handling of `.env` Files in Sage WordPress Projects.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sage `.env` Exclusion from Version Control:**  Verify and strictly enforce that the `.env` file is included in the `.gitignore` file for your Sage theme repository and is never committed to version control.
    2.  **Separate Sage `.env` Deployment:**  Ensure the `.env` file for your Sage theme is deployed separately from the Sage theme codebase itself. Avoid including it in the theme's deployment package.
    3.  **Server-Side Environment Variables for Sage (Recommended):**  Utilize server-side environment variable management for configuring your Sage WordPress site. Configure environment variables directly on the server or hosting environment instead of relying on `.env` files in production.
    4.  **Secure Storage for Sage `.env` (If Used):** If `.env` files are used on servers (less recommended for production), store them outside the web root and configure strict file permissions (e.g., 600) to restrict access to the web server user only.
    5.  **Sage Configuration Review:** Regularly review the configuration values stored in your `.env` file (or server environment variables) for your Sage project to ensure they are necessary, securely configured, and do not expose sensitive information unnecessarily.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sage Configuration Secrets - Critical Severity:** Accidental exposure of the `.env` file in a Sage project can reveal sensitive configuration details like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets crucial for the Sage-powered WordPress site's security.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sage Secrets Protection - High Impact:** Securely manages and protects sensitive configuration information used by the Sage theme, preventing unauthorized access and potential compromise of the WordPress site.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **`.env` in `.gitignore` for Sage (Likely Implemented):**  It's standard practice in Sage projects to include `.env` in `.gitignore`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Separate Sage `.env` Deployment:**  Deployment processes might still inadvertently include the `.env` file within the Sage theme package.
    *   **Server-Side Variables for Sage:**  Projects might be relying on `.env` files in production environments instead of leveraging more secure server-side environment variable management.
    *   **Sage `.env` File Security Audits:**  Lack of regular audits and reviews of the configuration values stored in `.env` files for Sage projects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Production-Optimized Sage Build Process (Webpack)](./mitigation_strategies/production-optimized_sage_build_process__webpack_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a Hardened Production Build Process for Sage Themes using Webpack.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sage Production Webpack Configuration:**  Maintain a dedicated and hardened Webpack configuration specifically for production builds of your Sage theme (`webpack.config.production.js` or environment-aware configuration).
    2.  **Disable Source Maps in Sage Production:**  Explicitly disable source map generation in your production Webpack configuration for Sage themes to prevent exposing source code in production environments.
    3.  **Sage Code Minification and Optimization:**  Enable code minification (TerserWebpackPlugin), CSS optimization (CSSNano), and other Webpack optimization techniques in your Sage production build to reduce bundle sizes and improve performance.
    4.  **Production-Only Sage Assets:** Configure Webpack to ensure that only production-ready assets (minified, optimized) are generated for Sage theme deployments, excluding development-specific tools or unnecessary files.
    5.  **Automated Sage Production Builds:**  Automate the production build process for your Sage theme and integrate it into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent and secure production builds for every deployment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sage Source Code Exposure via Source Maps - Medium Severity:**  Exposing source maps in production Sage themes can reveal theme logic and potentially aid attackers in identifying vulnerabilities.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface in Sage Themes - Low to Medium Severity:** Including development-related assets or unoptimized code in production Sage themes can unnecessarily increase the attack surface and potentially expose development tools.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sage Production Security and Performance - Medium Impact:**  Enhances the security and performance of deployed Sage themes by preventing source code exposure, reducing attack surface, and optimizing asset delivery.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic Webpack for Sage (Likely Implemented):** Sage projects utilize Webpack for asset bundling, and a basic configuration is typically present.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Dedicated Sage Production Webpack Config:**  Lack of a specifically hardened and optimized Webpack configuration exclusively for production builds of Sage themes.
    *   **Source Map Control in Sage Production:**  Source maps might be unintentionally enabled or publicly accessible in production deployments of Sage themes.
    *   **Full Optimization of Sage Production Builds:**  Production builds of Sage themes might not be fully optimized with minification, CSS optimization, and other performance-enhancing techniques.
    *   **Automated and Hardened Sage Production Build Pipeline:**  Production build process for Sage themes might not be fully automated, consistently applied, or hardened against potential build-time security risks.
