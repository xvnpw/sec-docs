## Mitigation Strategy: [Proactive Dependency Management and Monitoring (Sage-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/proactive_dependency_management_and_monitoring__sage-specific_aspects_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Proactive Dependency Management and Monitoring (Sage-Specific Aspects)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Schedule:** Create a recurring calendar event (e.g., monthly) to review and update Sage's *front-end* dependencies.
    2.  **Identify Outdated Packages:** Run `npm outdated` (or `yarn outdated`) in the theme directory. This lists Node.js packages with newer versions available.  Sage heavily relies on these for its build process and front-end functionality.
    3.  **Update Packages:** Run `npm update` (or `yarn upgrade`) to update packages to their latest compatible versions.  Pay close attention to updates for:
        *   **Webpack and its loaders/plugins:** These are crucial for Sage's asset compilation.
        *   **Bootstrap (if used):** Sage 9 often includes older versions.  Update to the latest *supported* version within Sage 9's compatibility range.
        *   **jQuery (if used):**  Similar to Bootstrap, update to the latest compatible version.  Consider migrating away from jQuery if possible, as newer versions of Sage (v10+) move away from it.
        *   **Any other front-end libraries:**  Font Awesome, Slick Slider, etc.
    4.  **Audit for Vulnerabilities:** Run `npm audit` (or `yarn audit`) to check for known vulnerabilities in your Node.js dependencies.  Address any reported issues.
    5.  **Lock Dependency Versions:** Ensure `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (Yarn) are committed to version control. This is *critical* for Sage to ensure consistent builds across environments.
    6.  **Automated Scanning:** Integrate a vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in your Node.js dependencies on every commit/pull request. This is particularly important for Sage's build process.
    7. **Vendor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow the social media accounts of the vendors of your key dependencies (Bootstrap, jQuery, Webpack, etc.).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Front-End Dependency Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical):** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in outdated front-end dependencies (e.g., XSS in an old jQuery version, vulnerabilities in Webpack loaders).
    *   **Build Process Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities in Webpack or its plugins could allow attackers to inject malicious code during the build process.
    *   **Inconsistent Builds (Severity: Medium):** Different dependency versions across environments leading to inconsistent builds and unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Front-End Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (70-90%) by keeping dependencies updated and using vulnerability scanning.
    *   **Build Process Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (50-70%) by keeping Webpack and related tools updated.
    *   **Inconsistent Builds:** Risk eliminated (100%) by using dependency locking.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `package-lock.json` is committed to version control.
    *   Occasional `npm update`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No scheduled dependency update process.
    *   No automated vulnerability scanning.
    *   `npm audit` is not regularly used.
    * Not subscribed to vendor security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Build Process (Sage-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_build_process__sage-specific_aspects_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Build Process (Sage-Specific Aspects)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `webpack.config.js`:** Regularly (e.g., with each major code change) review `webpack.config.js` and any other build configuration files (e.g., Gulpfile if used).
        *   Ensure no sensitive information (API keys, credentials) is hardcoded. Use environment variables instead (often via a `.env` file, *which should not be committed to version control*).
        *   Verify that any Webpack plugins or loaders used are from trusted sources and are up-to-date. Outdated loaders can have vulnerabilities.
        *   Check for any misconfigurations that could expose source maps or other sensitive information in production.
    2.  **Avoid Inline Scripts/Styles (where possible):** While Sage's structure encourages separating concerns, be mindful of any inline scripts or styles introduced during development *within Blade templates*. These can be harder to audit and may bypass some security mechanisms. Prefer external files managed by Sage's Webpack build process.
    3. **Content Security Policy (CSP) with Webpack Consideration:** When defining your CSP, be aware of how Sage's Webpack build process handles assets. You might need to configure `script-src` and `style-src` directives to allow for hashed or nonced scripts/styles generated by Webpack.  This is *crucial* for Sage, as it heavily relies on Webpack for asset management.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information (Severity: High):** API keys or credentials leaked through `webpack.config.js`.
    *   **Build-Time Code Injection (Severity: High):** Attackers modifying the Webpack configuration to include malicious scripts or styles during the build.
    *   **Bypass of CSP (Severity: Medium):** Inline scripts or styles violating the Content Security Policy, or Webpack-generated assets not being allowed by the CSP.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Risk eliminated (100%) by removing sensitive information from `webpack.config.js`.
    *   **Build-Time Code Injection:** Risk reduced (40-60%) by reviewing `webpack.config.js` and keeping build tools updated.
    *   **Bypass of CSP:** Risk eliminated (100%) by correctly configuring CSP to work with Webpack-generated assets and avoiding inline scripts/styles where possible.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Sensitive information is stored in environment variables.
    *   Basic CSP is implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Infrequent review of `webpack.config.js`.
    *   Some inline styles are present in Blade templates.
    *   CSP is not fully optimized for Webpack-generated assets (hashes/nonces).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Use of Blade (Sage-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_use_of_blade__sage-specific_aspects_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Use of Blade (Sage-Specific Aspects)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automatic Escaping Awareness:** Understand that Blade's `{{ $variable }}` syntax *automatically escapes HTML entities*. This is a core feature of Blade and a key part of Sage's security.
    2.  **Raw Output Caution:** Be *extremely* cautious when using the `{!! $variable !!}` syntax, which outputs raw, unescaped data. *Only* use this when absolutely necessary and when you are *certain* the data is safe (e.g., after *manually* sanitizing it using appropriate WordPress functions).  Never use it directly with user-supplied data. This is a common source of XSS vulnerabilities in Blade templates.
    3.  **Custom Directive Security:** If you create *custom Blade directives* (using `@directive`), ensure they handle escaping correctly. If the directive outputs HTML, use Blade's `e()` helper function to escape variables within the directive's output.
    4.  **Blade Component Escaping:** When passing data to *Blade components* (Sage 9's way of creating reusable UI elements), ensure that the data is escaped *within the component's template* if it's displayed.  Don't assume that data passed to a component is automatically safe.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Blade Templates (Severity: High):** Injection of malicious scripts through Blade templates, specifically due to misuse of raw output or insecure custom directives/components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (70-90%) by using Blade's automatic escaping correctly, being extremely cautious with raw output, and securing custom directives and components.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `{{ }}` is used for most output.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some instances of `{!! !!}` are used without proper sanitization.
    *   No specific security review of custom Blade directives or components.
