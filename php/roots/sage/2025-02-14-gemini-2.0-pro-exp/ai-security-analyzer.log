      "text": "1.  **Disable Source Maps in Production:** Open `webpack.config.js` and `webpack.config.optimize.js`. Locate the `devtool` option.  For production builds (typically triggered by `yarn build:production` or similar), set `devtool: false;`.  For development, you can use a safer option like `'inline-source-map'` or `'eval-cheap-module-source-map'`.  After building, inspect the generated `.js` files in your `dist` folder to confirm no `.map` files are present and that source code isn't easily readable.\n2.  **Verify `publicPath`:** In `webpack.config.js`, find the `output` section and the `publicPath` property.  Ensure this is set to the correct URL where your assets will be served in production (e.g., `/wp-content/themes/your-theme/dist/`).  Incorrect values can lead to 404 errors or, worse, reveal your server's directory structure.\n3.  **Secure Environment Variables:**\n    *   Install `dotenv`: `yarn add dotenv --dev`\n    *   Create a `.env` file in your project root.  Add your environment variables (e.g., `API_KEY=your_secret_key`).  **Never commit this file to version control.**\n    *   Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.\n    *   In `webpack.config.js`, require `dotenv`: `const Dotenv = require('dotenv-webpack');`\n    *   Add `Dotenv` to the `plugins` array: `plugins: [ new Dotenv() ]`.\n    *   Access variables in your JavaScript code using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.\n    *   **Crucially:**  Only expose *necessary* variables.  Don't blindly expose all variables from `.env`.  Consider using a separate configuration file to whitelist the variables exposed to the client.\n4.  **Code Splitting Review (if applicable):** If using code splitting (dynamic `import()`), after building, manually inspect the generated chunk files in your `dist` folder.  Ensure no sensitive data (API keys, internal comments, etc.) is present in these publicly accessible files.\n5. **Regularly Audit:** At least monthly, review the entire Webpack configuration for any accidental exposures or outdated configurations.\n\n*   **Threats Mitigated:**\n    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Exposing source maps reveals the original source code, making it easier for attackers to understand the application's logic and find vulnerabilities.  *Directly related to Sage's build process.*\n    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Incorrect `publicPath` can expose the server's directory structure. *Directly related to Sage's Webpack configuration.*\n    *   **Credential Exposure (Critical Severity):** Hardcoding or improperly handling environment variables can expose API keys, database credentials, or other secrets. *Directly related to how Sage encourages environment variable use in the build process.*\n    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Code splitting, if not carefully reviewed, can leak sensitive information in publicly accessible chunks. *Directly related to Sage's use of Webpack and code splitting features.*\n\n*   **Impact:**\n    *   **Information Disclosure (Source Maps):** Risk reduced to near zero.\n    *   **Information Disclosure (`publicPath`):** Risk significantly reduced.\n    *   **Credential Exposure:** Risk dramatically reduced.\n    *   **Information Disclosure (Code Splitting):** Risk reduced, but manual review is still crucial.\n\n*   **Currently Implemented:**\n    *   Source Maps Disabled: `webpack.config.optimize.js` - `devtool: false;`\n    *   `publicPath` Verified: `webpack.config.js` - `output: { publicPath: '/wp-content/themes/my-theme/dist/' }`\n    *   Environment Variables: Partially implemented. `dotenv` is used, but not all variables are carefully filtered.\n    * Code Splitting Review: Not implemented.\n\n*   **Missing Implementation:**\n    *   Environment Variables: Need to implement a whitelist to filter which variables from `.env` are exposed to the client.\n    *   Code Splitting Review:  Need to establish a process for regularly reviewing generated code chunks.\n    *   Regular Audit: Need to schedule and document regular audits of the Webpack configuration."

      "text": "1.  **Restrict Access:** Ensure Browsersync is only accessible from `localhost` or a trusted internal network via firewall rules (e.g., `sudo ufw deny 3000`).\n2.  **Disable in Production:** Ensure Browsersync code in `webpack.config.js` is *only* executed for development (e.g., `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`). The `browser-sync-webpack-plugin` should *not* be in the `plugins` array for production builds.\n3. **Verify:** After deploying to production, attempt to access your site on port 3000 (or the configured Browsersync port). You should *not* connect.\n\n*   **Threats Mitigated:**\n    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Exposing Browsersync could allow attackers to access the development environment. *Directly related to Sage's use of Browsersync.*\n\n*   **Impact:**\n    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced to near zero.\n\n*   **Currently Implemented:**\n    *   Restrict Access: Partially implemented.\n    *   Disable in Production: Implemented.\n    * Verify: Implemented.\n\n*   **Missing Implementation:**\n    *   Restrict Access: Need to ensure firewall rules are consistently applied."
