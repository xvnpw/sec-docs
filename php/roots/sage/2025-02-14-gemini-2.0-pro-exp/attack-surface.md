# Attack Surface Analysis for roots/sage

## Attack Surface: [1. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Node.js/npm/Yarn)](./attack_surfaces/1__dependency_vulnerabilities__node_jsnpmyarn_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Node.js packages used during the Sage build process.
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** Sage relies *heavily* on npm/Yarn for asset compilation (Webpack, Babel, etc.). This is a core part of Sage's functionality.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a Webpack loader (e.g., `sass-loader`) could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the compiled CSS, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of the development environment.
        *   Injection of malicious code into the website (XSS, data exfiltration).
        *   Denial of service during the build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if a vulnerability allows code execution in the build environment) to **High** (if it allows client-side attacks).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` frequently and update vulnerable packages immediately.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use a lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`).
        *   **Dependency Management Tools:** Employ tools like Dependabot or Snyk.
        *   **Isolated Build Environments:** Use CI/CD pipelines with isolated build environments (e.g., Docker containers).
        *   **Review `package.json`:** Periodically review to remove unnecessary dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unescaped Output in Blade Templates](./attack_surfaces/2__unescaped_output_in_blade_templates.md)

*   **Description:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to unescaped output in Blade templates.
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** Sage *uses* the Blade templating engine, which provides automatic escaping but *allows developers to bypass it*. This is a direct feature of Sage's templating system.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses the `{!! !!}` directive to output user-supplied data without sanitization, allowing XSS.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
        *   Session hijacking.
        *   Data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Default Escaping:** Always use `{{ }}` unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **Sanitize Raw Output:** If `{!! !!}` is required, meticulously sanitize the data using WordPress functions or a sanitization library.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all Blade templates.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure AJAX Handlers](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_ajax_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom AJAX handlers due to insufficient security.
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** Sage's structure *encourages* the use of custom JavaScript and AJAX, but doesn't inherently provide security for these handlers.  This is a common pattern within Sage development.
    *   **Example:** An AJAX endpoint that updates user profiles doesn't check for nonces or capabilities, allowing unauthorized modification.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
        *   Unauthorized data access and modification.
        *   Privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Nonces:** Use WordPress nonces.
        *   **Capability Checks:** Implement checks using `current_user_can()`.
        *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data on the server-side.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting.

## Attack Surface: [4. Hardcoded Secrets in JavaScript](./attack_surfaces/4__hardcoded_secrets_in_javascript.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of secrets in client-side JavaScript.
    *   **How Sage Contributes:** Sage's use of Webpack for JavaScript compilation doesn't *automatically* prevent developers from hardcoding secrets. This is a risk directly related to how Sage handles JavaScript.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes an API key in a JavaScript file, exposed in the compiled asset.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of API keys and secrets.
        *   Unauthorized use of third-party services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables.
        *   **Webpack DefinePlugin:** Inject environment variables during build.
        *   **Laravel Mix .env:** Use `.env` file support.
        *   **Never Commit Secrets:** Exclude `.env` files from version control.
        *   **Code Scanning:** Use static code analysis.

## Attack Surface: [5. Data Exposure in Controllers (Sage 9)](./attack_surfaces/5__data_exposure_in_controllers__sage_9_.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive data unintentionally passed from controllers to views.
    * **How Sage Contributes:** Sage 9's controller-view architecture *is the direct mechanism* that can lead to this if developers aren't careful.
    * **Example:** A controller passes a user's full database record, including password hashes, to the view.
    * **Impact:**
        * Exposure of sensitive user data.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Data Minimization:** Only pass *necessary* data to views.
        * **Data Transformation:** Transform data in the controller.
        * **View Logic:** Ensure views only display appropriate data.
        * **Code Review:** Carefully review controller and view code.
