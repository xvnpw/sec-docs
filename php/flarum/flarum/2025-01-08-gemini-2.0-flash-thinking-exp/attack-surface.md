# Attack Surface Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Attack Surface: [Unvetted Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unvetted_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in third-party extensions installed on the Flarum forum.
    *   **How Flarum Contributes:** Flarum's architecture allows for a highly extensible system where developers can create and distribute extensions. This open nature, while beneficial for functionality, introduces the risk of poorly coded or malicious extensions. Flarum itself doesn't inherently vet all extensions in community repositories.
    *   **Example:** A popular extension for adding custom profile fields has an SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious payload within a profile field, potentially gaining access to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from data breaches (accessing user data, forum content), to remote code execution on the server, and complete compromise of the Flarum installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   Install extensions only from trusted sources and developers.
            *   Review the code of extensions before installing, if feasible.
            *   Keep all extensions updated to their latest versions, as updates often contain security fixes.
            *   Consider using security scanning tools or services to analyze installed extensions for known vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement a process for evaluating the security of extensions before deployment.
            *   Minimize the number of installed extensions to reduce the overall attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Core Flarum Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/core_flarum_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security weaknesses present within the core Flarum codebase itself.
    *   **How Flarum Contributes:** As with any software, Flarum's core code can contain bugs or oversights that lead to vulnerabilities. The complexity of the platform and its features increases the potential for such flaws.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in Flarum's input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into a forum post, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against other users viewing the post.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to a wide range of issues, including XSS, data manipulation, authentication bypass, and potentially remote code execution if a critical flaw is found.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   Keep Flarum updated to the latest stable version. Security updates are regularly released to address discovered vulnerabilities.
            *   Monitor Flarum's official channels and security advisories for announcements of vulnerabilities and patches.
            *   Consider participating in Flarum's bug bounty program (if available) to contribute to identifying and resolving vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how Flarum handles user-uploaded files (avatars, attachments).
    *   **How Flarum Contributes:** Flarum allows users to upload files. If not properly validated and handled within the Flarum application, this can introduce security risks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image file as their avatar. Due to insufficient validation within Flarum, the script is stored and potentially executed by the web server.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to remote code execution, stored XSS (if malicious scripts are uploaded and served through Flarum), denial of service, and exposure of sensitive information if file access controls are weak.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict file type validation based on content rather than just the file extension within the Flarum application.
            *   Store uploaded files outside of the web server's document root and ensure Flarum serves them through a separate, controlled mechanism.
            *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities within Flarum's file handling.
            *   Implement file size limits within Flarum to prevent resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in Flarum's API endpoints that allow for unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
    *   **How Flarum Contributes:** Flarum provides an API for interacting with the forum programmatically. Vulnerabilities in these endpoints, which are part of the Flarum application, can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint responsible for updating user profiles lacks proper authentication or authorization checks within the Flarum codebase. An attacker could exploit this to modify any user's profile information without their consent.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modification of forum content or user data managed by Flarum, and potentially denial of service if API rate limits are not enforced by Flarum.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all Flarum API endpoints.
            *   Thoroughly validate all input data received by Flarum API endpoints to prevent injection attacks.
            *   Enforce rate limiting on Flarum API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
            *   Follow secure API development best practices within the Flarum project.

## Attack Surface: [Forum Feature Abuse (e.g., XSS in User Content)](./attack_surfaces/forum_feature_abuse__e_g___xss_in_user_content_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting legitimate forum features to inject malicious content or trigger unintended behavior.
    *   **How Flarum Contributes:** Flarum allows users to post content, which, if not properly sanitized by Flarum's rendering engine, can be a vector for attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a forum post containing malicious JavaScript code that is not properly sanitized by Flarum's rendering engine. When other users view this post through Flarum, the script executes in their browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Primarily cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, defacement within the forum, or redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content within the Flarum application.
            *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, configured within Flarum's environment.
            *   Regularly review and update sanitization libraries and configurations used by Flarum.
