**Specific Security Recommendations for Flarum:**

*   **Authentication and Session Management:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and protection against common password patterns.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks. Consider using techniques like CAPTCHA after a certain number of failed attempts.
    *   **Recommendation:** Utilize secure, HTTP-only, and SameSite cookies for session management to mitigate session hijacking and CSRF attacks.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement session regeneration after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider offering multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an optional or mandatory security enhancement.

*   **Authorization and Access Control:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system in the PHP backend and consistently enforce authorization checks before granting access to any resource or functionality.
    *   **Recommendation:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting users and extensions only the necessary permissions.
    *   **Recommendation:** Secure API endpoints with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations).

*   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement robust server-side input validation on the PHP backend for all user-supplied data, specifically using techniques like whitelisting allowed characters and formats.
    *   **Recommendation:** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement context-aware output encoding in the PHP backend before rendering data in HTML templates or returning JSON responses to the frontend.
