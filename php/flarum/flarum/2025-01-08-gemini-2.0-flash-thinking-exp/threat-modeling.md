# Threat Model Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Flarum Core Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_flarum_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a flaw in Flarum's core authorization or permission system. They exploit this vulnerability to gain access to features or data that should be restricted to higher-privileged users (e.g., moderators, administrators). This could involve manipulating API requests, exploiting flaws in permission checks, or leveraging insecure default configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of forum settings, banning or suspending users, potentially taking over the entire forum.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Flarum core's authorization middleware, permission logic within controllers or models, API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Flarum core updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Regularly review user roles and permissions.
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring Flarum's permissions.
        *   Implement thorough testing of permission checks during development.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Flarum Core](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_flarum_core.md)

*   **Description:**  Flarum core uses PHP's `unserialize()` function (or similar) on untrusted data without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when unserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, leading to complete server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Flarum core code that handles deserialization of data (e.g., session management, caching mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `unserialize()` on untrusted data.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use safer alternatives like JSON or implement robust input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
        *   Keep Flarum updated, as security updates often address insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability in Flarum Core](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability_in_flarum_core.md)

*   **Description:** Flarum core uses mass assignment (e.g., directly assigning request data to model attributes) without proper protection (e.g., using fillable or guarded properties in Eloquent models). An attacker can send unexpected parameters in a request, modifying sensitive attributes that they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Impact:**  Modification of user data (e.g., changing email addresses, passwords), privilege escalation by assigning admin roles, manipulation of forum settings.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Flarum core models that handle data persistence, controller methods that process user input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties in Eloquent models to explicitly define which attributes can be mass-assigned.
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize all user input before assigning it to model attributes.
        *   Avoid directly assigning request data to models without proper filtering.
