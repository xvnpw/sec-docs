        print("""
        The core vulnerability lies in the trust placed on user-provided data (the uploaded file and its metadata). Without proper validation and sanitization, attackers can leverage this to execute malicious code or inject harmful scripts.

        **Common Vulnerabilities:**

        *   **Insufficient File Type Validation:** Relying solely on file extensions is a major flaw. Attackers can easily rename malicious files (e.g., `evil.php.png`).
        *   **Lack of Content Sanitization:** Even if the file type seems safe, the content might contain malicious payloads (e.g., embedded JavaScript in SVG files).
        *   **Insecure Storage Location:** Storing uploaded files within the web server's document root allows direct access and potential execution.
        *   **Filename Manipulation Vulnerabilities (Path Traversal):**  Improperly handled filenames can allow attackers to overwrite or access sensitive files outside the intended upload directory (e.g., using `../`).
        *   **Lack of File Size Limits:** Can lead to denial-of-service attacks by consuming server resources.

        **Exploitation Scenarios:**

        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the web server executes PHP in the upload directory, the attacker can access the script via a direct URL, executing arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker uploads a malicious SVG or HTML file containing JavaScript as an avatar. When another user views the attacker's profile, the script executes in their browser.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading extremely large files can exhaust disk space or bandwidth, making the Flarum instance unavailable.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  In some cases, improper handling might allow attackers to access or overwrite sensitive files through path traversal vulnerabilities.

        print("\n### Enhanced Mitigation Strategies for Developers:")
        print("""
        Building upon the initial suggestions, here's a more detailed breakdown of mitigation strategies:

        *   **Strict Content-Based File Type Validation:**
            *   **Magic Number Verification:** Implement checks to verify the file's actual content based on its "magic number" (the first few bytes of the file). Libraries like `finfo` in PHP can be used for this.
            *   **MIME Type Sniffing (with Caution):** While client-provided MIME types are unreliable, server-side MIME type detection can be used as an additional check.
            *   **Dedicated File Validation Libraries:** Consider using well-vetted libraries specifically designed for file validation.

        *   **Secure File Storage and Serving:**
            *   **Store Outside Document Root:**  This is paramount. Configure Flarum to store uploaded files in a directory that is not directly accessible via web requests.
            *   **Unique and Non-Predictable Filenames:** Generate unique filenames (e.g., using UUIDs or hashes) to prevent direct access or guessing.
            *   **Controlled Serving Mechanism:** Implement a dedicated script or function within Flarum to serve uploaded files. This allows for access control checks and prevents direct execution of scripts.

        *   **Robust Filename Sanitization:**
            *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Only allow a specific set of safe characters (alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens, periods). Remove or replace any other characters.
            *   **Prevent Path Traversal:**  Strictly filter out sequences like `../` and ensure filenames do not start with `/`.
            *   **Limit Filename Length:** Prevent excessively long filenames that could cause issues.

        *   **Enforce File Size Limits:**
            *   **Configuration in Flarum:** Implement file size limits within the application's configuration.
            *   **Web Server Configuration:** Configure limits in the web server (e.g., `upload_max_filesize` in PHP's `php.ini`).

        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
            *   Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed, mitigating the impact of stored XSS.

        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
            *   Specifically test the file upload functionality with various malicious file types and payloads.

        *   **Input Sanitization for Metadata:**  Sanitize other file-related metadata like the original filename displayed to users to prevent potential UI-based issues.

        *   **Consider Using Dedicated File Storage Services:** For larger applications, consider using cloud-based object storage services (like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage) which often have built-in security features.

        print("\n### Testing Strategies for Mitigation Effectiveness:")
        print("""
        To ensure the implemented mitigations are effective, the development team should perform thorough testing:

        *   **Attempt to Upload Malicious Files:**
            *   PHP scripts disguised as images.
            *   HTML files containing JavaScript.
            *   SVG files with embedded scripts.
            *   Files with filenames containing path traversal sequences (`../`).
            *   Extremely large files to test size limits.
            *   Files with unusual or potentially problematic characters in the filename.

        *   **Verify Secure Storage:**
            *   Attempt to directly access uploaded files via their URL (this should fail if stored outside the document root).
            *   Inspect the storage directory to ensure files are stored with unique and non-predictable names.

        *   **Test File Serving Mechanism:**
            *   Verify that files are served through the intended controlled mechanism and not directly by the web server.
            *   Ensure that access controls are enforced during file serving.

        *   **Review CSP Headers:**
            *   Confirm that the Content Security Policy is correctly configured to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts.

        *   **Utilize Security Scanning Tools:**
            *   Employ static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
            *   Use dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools to simulate attacks against the running application.

        *   **Manual Code Review:**
            *   Have experienced developers review the file upload handling code for potential flaws.
