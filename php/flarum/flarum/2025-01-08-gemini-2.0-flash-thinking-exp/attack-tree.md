## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Flarum Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_flarum_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents attacks targeting vulnerabilities directly within the Flarum core codebase. These vulnerabilities, if present, can have widespread impact and are often actively sought after by attackers.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Core vulnerabilities affect the fundamental security of the application. Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the exploitation of flaws in how Flarum handles user-supplied data. Failure to properly sanitize and validate input is a common source of vulnerabilities.
*   **Why Critical:** Input validation flaws are a primary entry point for many web application attacks, including XSS and SQL Injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject malicious payloads](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the action of inserting malicious code or data into the application through vulnerable input fields.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful injection is the step that directly leads to the exploitation of the underlying vulnerability (e.g., executing JavaScript for XSS or manipulating database queries for SQLi).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the application that is then executed in the browsers of other users.
*   **Why High-Risk:** XSS has a relatively high likelihood due to the prevalence of user-generated content in forums. It can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, and defacement, impacting a wide range of users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: SQL Injection (SQLi)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_sql_injection__sqli_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the exploitation of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to insert malicious SQL code into database queries.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful SQLi can grant attackers full access to the application's database, allowing them to steal sensitive data, modify information, or even gain remote code execution on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the exploitation of weaknesses in how Flarum verifies user identities and controls access to resources and functionalities.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful exploitation of authentication or authorization flaws can allow attackers to bypass login mechanisms, escalate privileges, and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and administrative functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Flarum Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_flarum_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves targeting security flaws within third-party Flarum extensions.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Extensions are often developed by individuals or smaller teams and may not undergo the same level of security scrutiny as the core Flarum software. The wide variety of extensions and their varying quality make this a significant attack surface. A vulnerability in a popular extension can impact many Flarum installations.
