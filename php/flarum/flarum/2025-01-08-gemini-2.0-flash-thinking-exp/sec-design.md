## 4. Key Components

*   **User's Web Browser:** The primary interface for users to interact with the Flarum forum. It interprets and renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript received from the server.
*   **JavaScript Application ('Flarum Frontend'):** A sophisticated single-page application (SPA) built with a JavaScript framework (often Mithril.js or similar). It manages the user interface, handles user interactions, communicates with the backend API via asynchronous requests, and dynamically updates the displayed content without full page reloads.
*   **Web Server ('Nginx/Apache'):**  Acts as the entry point for all incoming HTTP requests. It is responsible for serving static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images), handling TLS/SSL encryption, and forwarding dynamic requests to the PHP application server. It may also perform load balancing and caching.
*   **PHP Application ('Flarum Core'):** The core business logic of the forum, typically built using a PHP framework or components from frameworks like Symfony or Laravel. It handles:
    *   **Request Routing:** Mapping incoming API requests to specific controllers and actions.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Verifying user identities and controlling access to resources and functionalities.
    *   **Data Processing:** Handling user input, validating data, and performing business logic.
    *   **Database Interaction:**  Querying and manipulating data stored in the database.
    *   **Event Handling:**  Responding to events within the application lifecycle (e.g., new post created, user registered).
    *   **Extension Management:**  Loading and managing extensions that add or modify forum functionality.
*   **Database ('MySQL/MariaDB'):** A relational database system used for persistent storage of all forum data, including:
    *   User accounts and profiles.
    *   Discussions, posts, and replies.
    *   Forum settings and configurations.
    *   Extension data and configurations.
    *   Permissions and roles.
*   **File Storage ('Local/Cloud Storage'):**  Used for storing user-uploaded files and potentially other assets. This can be:
    *   **Local Storage:** Files stored directly on the server's file system.
    *   **Cloud Storage:**  Utilizing services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar for scalable and durable storage.
*   **SMTP Server ('Email Service'):** An external service responsible for sending outgoing emails, such as:
    *   Password reset requests.
    *   New post notifications.
    *   User registration confirmations.
    *   Forum announcements.

## 5. Data Flow

*   **Displaying a List of Discussions:**
    *   The user's browser sends an HTTP GET request to the web server for the discussions list.
    *   The web server routes the request to the PHP application.
    *   The PHP application queries the database to retrieve a list of discussions, potentially with pagination and sorting.
    *   The PHP application formats the discussion data into a JSON response.
    *   The web server sends the JSON response back to the user's browser.
    *   The JavaScript application receives the JSON data and dynamically renders the list of discussions in the user interface.
*   **Submitting a New Reply to a Post:**
    *   The user enters their reply in the input field within the browser.
    *   The JavaScript application sends an HTTP POST request (with JSON data containing the reply content and the post/discussion ID) to the web server.
    *   The web server forwards the request to the PHP application.
    *   The PHP application authenticates and authorizes the user.
    *   The PHP application validates the reply content (e.g., checks for length, profanity).
    *   The PHP application inserts the new reply into the database.
    *   The PHP application may trigger notifications to subscribed users.
    *   The PHP application sends a success response (often including the newly created reply data) back to the web server.
    *   The web server sends the response to the user's browser.
    *   The JavaScript application updates the UI to display the new reply.
*   **Downloading an Attached File:**
    *   The user clicks on a link to download an attached file.
    *   The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the web server for the file.
    *   The web server routes the request to the PHP application.
    *   The PHP application authenticates and authorizes the user to access the file.
    *   The PHP application retrieves the file from the file storage (either local or cloud).
    *   The PHP application sends the file content back to the web server with appropriate headers (e.g., `Content-Disposition`).
    *   The web server streams the file content to the user's browser, prompting a download.

## 6. User Interactions

*   **Registration and Login:** Users register by providing credentials (username, email, password). The backend securely stores the password (hashed and salted). Login involves verifying provided credentials against the stored values. Session management (using cookies or tokens) maintains the authenticated state.
*   **Profile Management:** Users can view and modify their profiles. Updates are sent to the backend, which validates the input and updates the user data in the database.
*   **Creating and Editing Discussions and Posts:** Users with appropriate permissions can create new discussions and posts. The frontend sends the content to the backend, which validates and stores it in the database. Editing follows a similar process.
*   **Searching for Content:** Users can search for discussions and posts. The frontend sends a search query to the backend, which queries the database (potentially using full-text search capabilities) and returns the results.
*   **Notifications:** The system sends notifications to users for various events (e.g., new replies, mentions). These notifications can be delivered in-app or via email, handled by the backend and the SMTP server.
*   **Extension Management (Admin Interface):** Administrators can manage extensions through a dedicated interface. This involves uploading extension files, enabling/disabling extensions, and configuring their settings. These actions interact directly with the backend's file system and database.

## 7. External Dependencies

*   **PHP Packages (via Composer):**
    *   Framework components (e.g., Symfony components, Laravel components).
    *   Database interaction libraries (e.g., Doctrine DBAL, Eloquent ORM).
    *   Security libraries (e.g., password hashing, CSRF protection).
    *   Email sending libraries (e.g., SwiftMailer, Symfony Mailer).
    *   Image manipulation libraries (e.g., Intervention Image).
*   **JavaScript Packages (via npm/Yarn):**
    *   Frontend framework (e.g., Mithril.js, React, Vue.js).
    *   UI component libraries.
    *   HTTP request libraries (e.g., Axios, Fetch API).
    *   State management libraries.
*   **Runtime Environment:**
    *   PHP interpreter.
    *   Database server (MySQL/MariaDB).
    *   Web server software (Nginx/Apache).
    *   Operating System (Linux, Windows, macOS).
*   **Optional External Services (often via Extensions):**
    *   **OAuth Providers:** For social login (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub).
    *   **Cloud Storage Services:** For storing user uploads (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, DigitalOcean Spaces).
    *   **Search Services:** For enhanced search functionality (e.g., Algolia, Elasticsearch).
    *   **Analytics Platforms:** For tracking user behavior (e.g., Google Analytics, Matomo).
    *   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** For serving static assets globally.
    *   **Spam Filtering Services:** To prevent spam posts.
