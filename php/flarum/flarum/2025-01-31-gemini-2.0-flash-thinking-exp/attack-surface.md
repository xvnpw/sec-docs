# Attack Surface Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Forum Posts](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_forum_posts.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious scripts into forum posts that are executed in the browsers of other users viewing the content.
*   **Flarum Contribution:** Flarum handles user-generated content in posts, including Markdown and potentially BBCode. If Flarum's core input sanitization or the sanitization within extensions is insufficient, XSS vulnerabilities can arise. Extensions that add custom formatting or content handling directly increase this risk.
*   **Example:** A user crafts a post containing malicious JavaScript within Markdown or BBCode that bypasses Flarum's sanitization. When another user views this post, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting to a phishing site.
*   **Impact:** High - Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Flarum Core & Extension Updates:** Ensure Flarum core and all extensions are updated to the latest versions. Security updates often address XSS vulnerabilities in core parsing and rendering logic.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which browsers can load resources. This significantly reduces the impact of XSS even if it occurs within Flarum.
    *   **Regular Audits of Custom Extensions:** If developing custom extensions, prioritize rigorous security audits focusing on input sanitization and output encoding to prevent introducing new XSS vectors within the Flarum environment.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in extensions developed by third parties can be exploited to compromise the Flarum application.
*   **Flarum Contribution:** Flarum's core design encourages extensibility through extensions. The security posture of a Flarum application is heavily influenced by the security of the installed extensions. Flarum's marketplace model, while offering diverse functionality, inherently relies on the security practices of external developers.
*   **Example:** A popular Flarum extension for user avatars contains an SQL injection vulnerability. Attackers exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized access to the Flarum database, potentially compromising user credentials and sensitive forum data.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full application compromise, data breach, denial of service, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and extension privileges)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Extension Selection:**  Thoroughly vet extensions before installation. Prioritize extensions from trusted developers, those with good community reviews, and those that are actively maintained. Consider the security reputation of the extension developer.
    *   **Minimize Extension Footprint:** Install only essential extensions. Reducing the number of extensions minimizes the potential attack surface introduced by third-party code within Flarum.
    *   **Regular Extension Updates:**  Maintain all installed extensions at their latest versions. Security updates for extensions are crucial for patching known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Community Security Awareness:** Engage with the Flarum community to stay informed about reported vulnerabilities in extensions and best practices for secure extension management.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in how the Flarum API authenticates users and authorizes access to resources can allow unauthorized access and actions.
*   **Flarum Contribution:** Flarum's modern architecture relies heavily on its API for frontend interactions and potential integrations. Weaknesses in Flarum's core API security directly expose core functionalities and data management processes.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Flarum's API authorization logic allows a regular user to bypass permission checks and access administrative API endpoints, enabling them to perform actions like deleting categories or banning users without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** High - Data manipulation, unauthorized access to administrative functions, privilege escalation, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Flarum Core Updates:** Keep Flarum core updated. Security updates often include fixes for API authentication and authorization flaws.
    *   **Review Extension API Usage:** If extensions introduce new API endpoints or modify existing ones, carefully review their security implications. Ensure extensions adhere to Flarum's intended API security model.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct security testing specifically targeting the Flarum API, including authorization testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify potential weaknesses in the core API or introduced by extensions.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (Potential in Extensions or Custom Code interacting with Flarum's Database)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__potential_in_extensions_or_custom_code_interacting_with_flarum's_database_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing them to bypass security measures, access sensitive data, modify data, or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **Flarum Contribution:** While Flarum core is built using Laravel's Eloquent ORM to mitigate SQL injection risks in core functionalities, extensions or custom code that directly interact with Flarum's database (bypassing Eloquent or using raw queries improperly) can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities within the Flarum application.
*   **Example:** A poorly coded Flarum extension uses raw SQL queries to retrieve user data and fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker crafts a malicious input that, when processed by the extension's SQL query, allows them to extract sensitive data like password hashes directly from the Flarum database.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, potential server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce ORM Usage in Extensions:**  When developing extensions, strictly adhere to using Flarum's Eloquent ORM for database interactions. Avoid raw SQL queries unless absolutely necessary and only when implemented with extreme care and security expertise.
    *   **Code Reviews for Extensions:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of all extensions, especially those interacting with the database, to identify and eliminate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Database Access Control:**  Restrict database user privileges used by Flarum to the minimum necessary. Avoid granting overly permissive database access to the Flarum application.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling (If Enabled by Flarum Extensions)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling__if_enabled_by_flarum_extensions_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the handling of file uploads, typically introduced by extensions, can allow attackers to upload malicious files, such as web shells, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Flarum Contribution:** Flarum core itself might not offer general file upload features, but extensions frequently add this functionality (e.g., attachments, avatars). Insecure file upload implementations within these extensions directly expose the Flarum application to this critical risk.
*   **Example:** A file upload extension for attachments in forum posts lacks proper file type validation and storage security. An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as a harmless file. By directly accessing the uploaded file, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Flarum application.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote code execution, server compromise, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure File Upload Implementation in Extensions:** If developing or using extensions with file upload features, ensure they implement robust security measures: strict file type validation (allowlisting), file size limits, file content scanning, secure file storage outside the web root, and proper configuration of web server to serve uploaded files securely.
    *   **Extension Security Audits:**  Prioritize security audits of extensions that handle file uploads to verify the robustness of their implementation and identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Minimize File Upload Functionality:**  Carefully consider the necessity of file upload features. If not essential, avoid enabling or installing extensions that introduce file upload capabilities to reduce this critical attack surface.
