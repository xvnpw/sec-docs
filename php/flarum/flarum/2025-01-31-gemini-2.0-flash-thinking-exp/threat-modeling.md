# Threat Model Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code through input fields or URL parameters *within Flarum's application logic or extensions*. This can allow them to bypass security measures, read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even execute operating system commands on the database server.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, server compromise, denial of service.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** Flarum Core (database interaction layer), Extensions (if they perform custom database queries).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions *within Flarum development*.
    *   Employ Eloquent ORM correctly to abstract database interactions and reduce raw SQL usage *in Flarum extensions and customizations*.
    *   Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs *handled by Flarum or extensions* before they are used in database queries.
    *   Regular security audits and code reviews *specifically focusing on Flarum core and extensions* to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into forum content (posts, profiles, etc.) *due to vulnerabilities in Flarum's rendering or input handling, or within extensions*. When other users view this content, the malicious script executes in their browsers. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the forum, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, defacement, malware distribution, phishing attacks.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** Flarum Core (rendering engine, input handling), Extensions (if they introduce new input fields or content rendering).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust output encoding/escaping for all user-generated content before displaying it on the page *within Flarum's templating system and extension development*. Use context-aware escaping.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict resource sources, mitigating XSS impact *and configurable within Flarum's environment*.
    *   Input validation and sanitization to filter out potentially malicious scripts before storing user-generated content *within Flarum's input processing and extension development*.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within Flarum core or an extension* to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Flarum application. This is often achieved through vulnerabilities in file upload functionality *provided by Flarum or extensions*, insecure deserialization *within Flarum's code*, or other server-side vulnerabilities *specific to Flarum's architecture*.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, malware deployment.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** Flarum Core (various components depending on the vulnerability, e.g., file upload handlers, deserialization processes), Extensions (if they introduce vulnerable code).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Flarum core and all extensions up-to-date with the latest security patches *provided by the Flarum team and extension developers*.
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing *specifically targeting Flarum and its extensions* to identify RCE vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement secure file upload mechanisms *within Flarum configurations and extension development*: validate file types, sanitize filenames, store uploaded files outside the web root, and prevent execution of uploaded files.
    *   Disable or restrict insecure deserialization if possible *within Flarum's configuration or code if applicable*.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds a way to bypass the authentication mechanisms of Flarum and gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative panels without providing valid credentials. This could be due to flaws in the login logic, session management, or password reset processes *within Flarum core or authentication-related extensions*.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, forum defacement, data manipulation.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** Flarum Core (authentication system, session management, password reset), Extensions (if they modify authentication).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong and well-tested authentication libraries and frameworks (Flarum uses Laravel's authentication) *and ensure proper configuration within Flarum*.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrators and optionally for users *using Flarum extensions or integrations*.
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing of authentication mechanisms *specifically within the context of Flarum's authentication flow*.
    *   Properly configure and secure session management *according to Flarum's documentation and best practices*.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Flarum's authorization system to access resources or perform actions that they are not authorized to. This could involve accessing admin panels, viewing private discussions, or modifying content they shouldn't be able to *due to flaws in Flarum's permission system or extensions modifying it*.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, forum defacement.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** Flarum Core (authorization system, role-based access control), Extensions (if they modify authorization or introduce new roles/permissions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure it is correctly enforced throughout the application *using Flarum's permission system and when developing extensions*.
    *   Regularly review and audit permissions and roles to ensure they are correctly configured and aligned with the principle of least privilege *within Flarum's admin panel and extension configurations*.
    *   Security testing to verify authorization enforcement at different levels of the application *specifically testing Flarum's permission logic and extension integrations*.

## Threat: [Extension/Plugin Vulnerabilities (General)](./threats/extensionplugin_vulnerabilities__general_.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party Flarum extensions may contain security vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices, lack of security audits, or reliance on vulnerable dependencies. These vulnerabilities can be exploited in the same ways as core vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, RCE, etc.) *and are directly introduced by the Flarum extension ecosystem*.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from minor data leaks to complete server compromise.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** Flarum Extensions (specific extension code).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and extension popularity/usage).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install extensions from trusted sources (e.g., official Flarum extensions, reputable developers) *within the Flarum ecosystem*.
    *   Carefully review extension code before installation if possible, or rely on community reviews and security assessments *specific to Flarum extensions*.
    *   Keep extensions up-to-date with the latest versions, as updates often include security patches *provided by Flarum extension developers*.
    *   Regularly audit installed extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or maintained *within your Flarum instance*.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Configuration *within Flarum*](./threats/insecure_file_upload_configuration_within_flarum.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured file upload settings *within Flarum's settings or extensions* can allow attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) to the server. If these files can be executed, it can lead to RCE.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, data breach, malware distribution.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** Flarum Core (file upload functionality), Extensions (if they introduce file upload features).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate file types and extensions on the server-side *using Flarum's file upload configurations and within extension code* to only allow permitted file types.
    *   Sanitize filenames to prevent directory traversal or other injection attacks *within Flarum's file handling*.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web root *as recommended by Flarum best practices*.
    *   Implement strong access controls on uploaded files *using Flarum's permission system or extension-specific controls*.

## Threat: [Weak Database Credentials *used by Flarum*](./threats/weak_database_credentials_used_by_flarum.md)

*   **Description:** Using weak or default database credentials *for the database Flarum is configured to use* makes the database a prime target for attackers. If an attacker gains access to the database, they can potentially compromise the entire Flarum application and its data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, server compromise.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** Flarum Core (database configuration), Database Server *as configured for Flarum*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong, randomly generated passwords for database users *used by Flarum*.
    *   Change default database credentials immediately after Flarum installation.
    *   Store database credentials securely (e.g., in environment variables, not directly in code) *as per Flarum's configuration guidelines*.
