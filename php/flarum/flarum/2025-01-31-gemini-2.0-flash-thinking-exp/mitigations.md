# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Extension Vetting](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_extension_vetting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous Extension Vetting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Extension Needs:** Before searching for extensions, clearly define the functionalities needed for your forum within Flarum's ecosystem. Avoid installing extensions "just in case".
    2.  **Source Verification:** Prioritize extensions from the official Flarum Extiverse hub or developers with a strong, reputable history in the Flarum community. Check for verified badges on Extiverse.
    3.  **Code Review (If Possible):** For critical extensions or those from less known sources, attempt to review the extension's code on platforms like GitHub. Look for obvious security flaws, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network requests within the Flarum extension context. If you lack coding expertise, seek community advice or consult a security professional familiar with Flarum extensions.
    4.  **Community Feedback Check:** Search for reviews, forum discussions, and bug reports specifically related to the extension within the Flarum community. Look for mentions of security issues or unexpected behavior in a Flarum context.
    5.  **Testing in Staging:** Before deploying to production, install and thoroughly test the extension in a staging Flarum environment that mirrors your production setup. Monitor Flarum logs and browser console for errors or unusual activity related to the extension.
    6.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review installed extensions and their necessity within your Flarum forum. Remove any extensions that are no longer required or actively maintained by their developers in the Flarum ecosystem.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Extension Installation (High Severity):** Installing a deliberately malicious Flarum extension can grant attackers control over the forum, allowing data theft, defacement, and user compromise *within the Flarum application*.
    *   **Vulnerable Extension Installation (High Severity):** Installing a Flarum extension with security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection *within the Flarum context*) can be exploited by attackers to compromise the forum and its users.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Compromised or backdoored updates to legitimate Flarum extensions can introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code into the forum *specifically affecting Flarum functionality*.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** for Malicious and Vulnerable Extension Installation threats. **Medium Reduction** for Supply Chain Attacks (as vetting reduces the likelihood of using less reputable Flarum extension sources).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented through the Extiverse hub's verification system and community feedback mechanisms within the Flarum community. Flarum core itself does not enforce extension vetting.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No automated vetting process within Flarum itself. Relies heavily on administrator diligence and community awareness within the Flarum ecosystem. Could be improved by integrating automated security scans into extension marketplaces or providing tools for administrators to easily review extension code and security reports *specifically for Flarum extensions*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Flarum Core Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_flarum_core_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Flarum Core Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitoring Release Channels:** Subscribe to the official Flarum blog, community forums, and security mailing lists to stay informed about new Flarum releases and security announcements *specifically for Flarum core*.
    2.  **Update Planning:** When a new Flarum version is released, review the changelog and security notes to understand the changes and potential security fixes *within Flarum core*. Plan an update window, ideally during off-peak hours for your Flarum forum.
    3.  **Backup Creation:** Before initiating the update, create a full backup of your Flarum database and files. This allows for easy rollback in case of Flarum update failures or unexpected issues *within the Flarum application*.
    4.  **Staging Environment Update:**  Apply the Flarum update to a staging environment first. Thoroughly test all core Flarum functionalities and critical extensions after the update to ensure compatibility and stability *within the Flarum application*.
    5.  **Production Update:** Once staging testing is successful, apply the Flarum update to your production environment following the official Flarum update guide.
    6.  **Post-Update Verification:** After the production Flarum update, verify that the forum is functioning correctly and that no errors are present *within the Flarum application*. Monitor Flarum logs for any anomalies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Flarum Core Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Flarum versions are susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities *in Flarum core* that attackers can easily exploit.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation (Medium Severity):** While Flarum updates primarily address known vulnerabilities, staying up-to-date reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered zero-day vulnerabilities *in Flarum core* before patches are available.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** for Exploitation of Known Flarum Core Vulnerabilities. **Medium Reduction** for Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploitation (reduces exposure time to Flarum core vulnerabilities).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Flarum provides update notifications within the admin panel, encouraging administrators to update the Flarum core.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No automatic updates for Flarum core. Relies on administrators to manually initiate and manage the Flarum core update process. Could be improved by offering optional automatic minor Flarum core updates or more prominent in-dashboard security alerts *specifically for Flarum core*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation *for Flarum*](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__implementation_for_flarum.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation *for Flarum*
*   **Description:**
    1.  **CSP Header Configuration:** Configure your web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) to send the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with every response *for your Flarum application*.
    2.  **Policy Definition:** Define a strict CSP policy that whitelists only necessary sources for different resource types (scripts, styles, images, fonts, etc.) *required by Flarum and its extensions*. Start with a restrictive policy and gradually relax it as needed, testing within your Flarum forum at each step.
        *   Example (very basic and needs customization for Flarum): `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:;`  *This needs to be adjusted to allow necessary Flarum resources and potentially resources from trusted extension providers.*
    3.  **Report-Only Mode (Initial Testing):** Initially deploy the CSP in `report-only` mode (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) to monitor for policy violations without blocking resources *within your Flarum forum*. Analyze the reports to fine-tune the policy for Flarum's specific needs.
    4.  **Enforcement Mode:** Once the policy is refined and tested in `report-only` mode, switch to enforcement mode by using the `Content-Security-Policy` header *for your Flarum application*.
    5.  **Regular CSP Review and Updates:** Periodically review and update the CSP as your Flarum forum's needs evolve (e.g., adding new extensions or external resources *used by Flarum*).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks (High Severity):** CSP significantly reduces the impact of XSS attacks *within Flarum* by preventing the browser from executing malicious scripts injected by attackers. Even if XSS vulnerabilities exist in Flarum or its extensions, CSP can block the exploitation.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):** CSP can help mitigate certain data injection attacks *within Flarum* by limiting the sources from which data can be loaded.
    *   **Clickjacking Attacks (Low Severity):** CSP's `frame-ancestors` directive can help prevent clickjacking attacks against your Flarum forum by controlling which domains can embed your forum in frames.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** for XSS Attacks *in Flarum*. **Medium Reduction** for Data Injection Attacks *in Flarum*. **Low Reduction** for Clickjacking Attacks *against Flarum*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not directly implemented by default in Flarum core. Requires manual configuration of the web server *for Flarum*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Flarum does not automatically generate or configure CSP headers. Administrators need to implement this manually at the web server level *for their Flarum application*. Could be improved by providing a CSP configuration section in the Flarum admin panel or offering a CSP extension *specifically tailored for Flarum*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention *within Flarum*](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_abuse_prevention_within_flarum.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention *within Flarum*
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Flarum Endpoints:** Determine the Flarum forum endpoints that are most susceptible to abuse (login, registration, posting, password reset, search, API endpoints *within Flarum*).
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting (Web Server Level or Flarum Extension):** Configure your web server (Nginx, Apache) or utilize a dedicated rate limiting service *in conjunction with Flarum* to limit requests.  Alternatively, explore Flarum extensions that provide rate limiting capabilities specifically for forum actions.
        *   Example (Nginx - needs adaptation for Flarum paths): `limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=login:10m rate=5r/m; ... location /login { limit_req zone=login burst=3 nodelay; ... }` *Adjust `/login` to the actual Flarum login path.*
    3.  **Flarum Extension Rate Limiting (Preferred):** Explore and utilize Flarum extensions that provide rate limiting capabilities specifically for forum actions (posting, registration, etc.). These are often more tightly integrated with Flarum's logic.
    4.  **CAPTCHA Implementation *in Flarum*:** Implement CAPTCHA (or similar challenge-response mechanisms) for sensitive actions like registration, login (after failed attempts), and posting *within Flarum* to prevent automated bots and brute-force attacks. Flarum extensions are available for CAPTCHA integration.
    5.  **Account Lockout Policies *in Flarum*:** Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts *within Flarum* to prevent brute-force password attacks. Flarum core has some basic lockout functionality.
    6.  **Honeypot Techniques *in Flarum Forms*:** Consider using honeypot techniques (hidden fields) in Flarum forms (registration, posting) to detect and block automated bots.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Password Attacks (High Severity):** Rate limiting and account lockout *within Flarum* prevent attackers from rapidly trying numerous passwords to gain unauthorized access to Flarum accounts.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting *in front of Flarum* can mitigate some forms of DoS attacks by limiting the request rate from individual sources, preventing resource exhaustion *of the Flarum application*.
    *   **Spam and Bot Abuse (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting and CAPTCHA *within Flarum* help prevent automated bots from spamming forums with unwanted content or creating fake Flarum accounts.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Low Severity):** Rate limiting *for Flarum actions* can prevent individual users or bots from excessively consuming server resources *used by Flarum*, ensuring fair resource allocation.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** for Brute-Force Password Attacks *on Flarum accounts*. **Medium Reduction** for DoS Attacks *targeting Flarum* and Spam/Bot Abuse *within Flarum*. **Low Reduction** for Resource Exhaustion *by Flarum processes*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Flarum core has basic throttling for login attempts. Extensions can provide more advanced rate limiting features *specifically for Flarum actions*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No comprehensive built-in rate limiting system in Flarum core for all critical endpoints *beyond login*. Server-level rate limiting and CAPTCHA implementation are often left to administrators to configure *around Flarum*. Could be improved by offering more granular rate limiting options within Flarum core and easier CAPTCHA integration *directly within Flarum's admin panel*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debug Mode in Production *for Flarum*](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debug_mode_in_production_for_flarum.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Debug Mode in Production *for Flarum*
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration File Check:** Open your Flarum `config.php` file located in the root directory of your Flarum installation.
    2.  **Debug Setting Verification:** Locate the `'debug'` setting within the `return` array.
    3.  **Set to False:** Ensure the value of `'debug'` is set to `false`. If it is set to `true`, change it to `false`.
    4.  **Save Changes:** Save the `config.php` file.
    5.  **Restart PHP-FPM/Web Server (If Necessary):** In some server environments, you might need to restart PHP-FPM or your web server for the configuration change to take effect.
    6.  **Verify in Production:** Access your production Flarum forum and ensure that debug information is no longer displayed in error messages or page source.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Debug mode in Flarum can expose sensitive information such as database credentials, file paths, and application internals in error messages and logs, which can be valuable to attackers.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Low Severity):** Debug mode might enable more verbose error reporting and potentially expose internal application workings, slightly increasing the attack surface by providing more information to potential attackers.
*   **Impact:** **Medium Reduction** for Information Disclosure. **Low Reduction** for Increased Attack Surface.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Flarum defaults to debug mode being disabled in production if the `APP_DEBUG` environment variable is not explicitly set to `true`. However, manual verification is recommended.
*   **Missing Implementation:** While the default is secure, Flarum could provide a more prominent warning in the admin panel if debug mode is detected as enabled in a production environment, or offer a configuration check tool.
