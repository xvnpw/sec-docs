```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Source Code Repository (GitHub).
2. Code commit triggers the CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. CI/CD Pipeline sets up a Build Environment.
4. In the Build Environment:
    - Source code is checked out.
    - Dependencies are installed.
    - Application is built and tested (unit tests, integration tests).
    - Security Scans are performed:
        - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify code vulnerabilities.
        - Dependency Check to identify vulnerable dependencies.
5. If vulnerabilities are found during security scans, feedback is provided to the Developer to fix them. The build process may fail.
6. If no critical vulnerabilities are found, the build process continues.
7. Build artifacts (e.g., Docker images for Web Server and API Application) are published to an Artifact Repository (e.g., Docker Registry, GitHub Container Registry).
8. Deployment System (e.g., Kubernetes) pulls the new artifacts from the Artifact Repository and deploys them to the target environment.

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Secure Source Code Repository (GitHub): Access control, audit logging, branch protection.
- security control: Automated CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions): Pipeline as code, version control, access control to pipeline configuration.
- security control: Isolated Build Environment: Ephemeral build environment, minimizing attack surface.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Automated code analysis to detect potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency Check: Automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Container Image Scanning: Scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities before publishing.
- security control: Artifact Repository Security: Access control to artifact repository, vulnerability scanning of stored images, content trust/image signing.
- security control: Secure artifact transfer: HTTPS for communication with artifact repository.
- security control: Code review process before merging code changes to main branch.
- security control: Regular security updates of build tools and dependencies in the build environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Forum availability and accessibility for users.
- Integrity of forum content and data.
- Confidentiality of user data (passwords, email addresses, potentially private discussions).
- Reputation and user trust in the platform.
- Administrative functions and control over the forum.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User credentials (passwords): Highly sensitive, require strong encryption and protection against unauthorized access.
- User personal information (email addresses, usernames, profiles): Sensitive, require protection against unauthorized access and disclosure.
- Forum content (posts, discussions): Public content, but integrity is important. Private discussions (if feature exists) would be sensitive.
- Forum settings and configurations: Sensitive, access should be restricted to administrators.
- Database backups: Sensitive, should be securely stored and access controlled.
- API keys and secrets: Highly sensitive, require secure storage and management.
- Logs: Can contain sensitive information, access should be controlled.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the expected scale of the forum (number of users, posts, traffic)? This will influence scalability and performance requirements.
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)? This will impact data privacy and security controls.
- What is the budget for security measures? This will influence the feasibility of implementing certain security controls.
- Are there any specific features planned that might introduce new security risks (e.g., file uploads, integrations with external services)?
- What is the process for managing user-contributed extensions and ensuring their security?
- What is the incident response plan in case of a security breach?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - The primary business goal is to provide a stable, user-friendly, and secure forum platform.
    - Security and user trust are important business priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE:
    - Standard web security best practices are intended to be followed.
    - The development team is responsive to security issues and provides updates.
    - Deployment environment is assumed to be a standard cloud or server infrastructure.
- DESIGN:
    - The application follows a typical three-tier web architecture (web server, application server, database).
    - The frontend is a JavaScript application, and the backend is a PHP API.
    - Deployment is envisioned to be containerized and potentially orchestrated with Kubernetes for scalability and resilience.
    - A standard CI/CD pipeline is used for building and deploying the application.
