## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Flarum Core](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_flarum_core.md)

*   **1.1 Unpatched Known CVEs in Flarum Core (HIGH RISK)**
    *   This path represents the exploitation of publicly known and documented vulnerabilities in the Flarum core software for which patches are available but have not been applied.

    *   **[1.1.1 Identify unpatched Flarum version]**
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   Justification: Flarum version information can often be obtained through various methods, including examining HTTP headers, JavaScript files, or API endpoints. Attackers can automate this process.

    *   **[1.1.2 Research known CVEs for the identified version]**
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Very Easy
        *   Justification: Public CVE databases (like NIST NVD) and Flarum's own security advisories provide readily available information about known vulnerabilities.

    *   **[1.1.3 Exploit a suitable CVE]**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   Justification: The likelihood depends on the availability of a working exploit and the complexity of the vulnerability.  The impact is very high because many CVEs can lead to remote code execution (RCE) or privilege escalation, granting administrative access. Detection depends on the presence and configuration of security tools like IDS/IPS and WAFs.

    *   1.1.4 Gain Admin Access
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: N/A
        *   Skill Level: N/A
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
        *   Justification:  Successful exploitation of a privilege escalation or RCE vulnerability typically leads directly to administrative access.  A skilled attacker can often cover their tracks, making detection difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_installed_extensions.md)

*   **2.1 Unpatched Known CVEs in Extensions (HIGH RISK)**
    *   This path is analogous to 1.1, but focuses on vulnerabilities in third-party Flarum extensions.  It's often a higher risk due to the larger number of extensions and potentially lower security standards compared to the core.

    *   **[2.1.1 Identify installed extensions and their versions]**
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   Justification: Similar to Flarum core, extension information can often be gleaned from the forum's publicly accessible files and API responses.

    *   **[2.1.2 Research known CVEs for the identified extensions and versions]**
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Very Easy
        *   Justification:  CVE databases and extension-specific security advisories (if available) are used.

    *   **[2.1.3 Exploit a suitable CVE]**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   Justification: The likelihood and effort depend on the specific extension and vulnerability.  The impact can be very high, as extensions can have significant privileges within Flarum.

    *   2.1.4 Gain Admin Access
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: N/A
        *   Skill Level: N/A
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
        *   Justification:  The likelihood depends on the specific extension's functionality.  If the extension has administrative capabilities or can be used to escalate privileges, admin access is a likely outcome.

    *   **[2.4 Insecure Extension Configuration] (HIGH RISK)**
    *   This path involves exploiting weaknesses arising from improperly configured extensions, such as default credentials, overly permissive settings, or exposed sensitive information.

    *   2.4.1 Identify extensions with default or weak configurations.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
        *   Justification:  Many administrators fail to change default settings, making this a common vulnerability.  Detection is relatively easy through manual inspection or automated scanning.

    *   2.4.2 Exploit misconfigured settings to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   Justification: Once a misconfiguration is identified, exploitation is often straightforward, requiring only basic knowledge of the extension's functionality.

    *   2.4.3 Gain Admin Access
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: N/A
        *   Skill Level: N/A
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
        *   Justification: The likelihood depends on the specific misconfiguration and the extension's capabilities.  If the misconfiguration allows for privilege escalation or access to sensitive data, administrative access is a possible outcome.
