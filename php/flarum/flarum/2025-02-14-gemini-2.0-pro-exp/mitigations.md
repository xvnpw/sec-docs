# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Extension Selection and Management (Flarum-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_extension_selection_and_management__flarum-centric_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Research on Extiverse/Community:** Before installing, research extensions on Extiverse (if listed) and the Flarum community forum. Look for active maintenance, positive feedback, and a reasonable number of downloads.
2.  **Permission Review (Admin Panel):** *Immediately* after installation, use Flarum's admin panel to review and restrict the permissions granted to the extension.  Grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions.
3.  **Regular Updates (Admin Panel/Composer):** Use the Flarum admin panel or Composer (`composer update`) to check for and apply extension updates regularly (e.g., weekly).  Prioritize security updates.
4.  **Periodic Audits (Admin Panel):** Regularly (e.g., quarterly) review all installed extensions in the Flarum admin panel. Remove any that are unused, unmaintained, or have known security issues.
5. **Staging Environment (with Flarum):** Before installing new extensions or updates on the production Flarum instance, install and test them in a staging environment that mirrors the production Flarum setup.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** From vulnerable extensions.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High Severity):** From vulnerable extensions.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi) (Critical Severity):** From vulnerable extensions.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (High Severity):** From vulnerable extensions.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity):** From vulnerable extensions.
*   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** From various extension vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   Significantly reduces the risk of all listed threats originating from extensions.

**Currently Implemented (Hypothetical):**
*   Permissions are reviewed for new extensions.
*   Monthly update checks.

**Missing Implementation (Hypothetical):**
*   No formal pre-installation research process.
*   No periodic extension audits.
*   Inconsistent use of staging environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prompt Flarum Core Updates (Composer)](./mitigation_strategies/prompt_flarum_core_updates__composer_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Subscribe to Announcements:** Subscribe to Flarum release announcements.
2.  **Regular Checks:** Regularly check the Flarum website/GitHub.
3.  **Update via Composer:** Use Composer (`composer update`) to update Flarum to the latest stable version, following official instructions.
4.  **Backup (Before Update):** Create a full backup (files and database) *before* any update.
5.  **Testing (After Update):** Thoroughly test the forum after updating.
6. **Staging Environment (with Flarum):** Apply updates to a staging Flarum instance first, test, then deploy to production.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **All vulnerabilities disclosed in Flarum core updates (Severity varies, can be Critical):** XSS, CSRF, SQLi, RCE, etc., in the core.

**Impact:**
*   Eliminates known core vulnerabilities.

**Currently Implemented (Hypothetical):**
*   Updates applied within a week of release.
*   Backups taken before updates.

**Missing Implementation (Hypothetical):**
*   No staging environment used for updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Flarum Configuration (`config.php`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_flarum_configuration___config_php__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`config.php` Review:** Carefully review the `config.php` file.  Ensure `debug` is `false` in production. Verify database credentials are strong and unique. Check all settings.
2.  **Database Credentials (Strong & Unique):** Use a strong, unique password for the Flarum database user *within* the `config.php` file.  Do *not* use the database `root` user.
3. **Admin Access Restriction (Consider .htaccess or server config *if* no other options):** While ideally done at the server level, if *absolutely necessary* and no other options are available, *consider* using `.htaccess` (Apache) to restrict access to the `/admin` route.  This is less robust than server-level restrictions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Exposing debug info.
*   **Database Compromise (Critical Severity):** Weak database credentials in `config.php`.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Against the admin panel (limited mitigation with `.htaccess`).

**Impact:**
*   Reduces risk of information disclosure and database compromise.
*   Provides *limited* mitigation against admin panel brute-force (if `.htaccess` is used as a last resort).

**Currently Implemented (Hypothetical):**
*   `debug` is `false` in production.
*   Strong database credentials in `config.php`.

**Missing Implementation (Hypothetical):**
*   No `.htaccess` restrictions on `/admin` (ideally, this would be handled at the server level).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Usage (Flarum-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_usage__flarum-centric_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **API Key Generation (Flarum/Secure Random):** Use Flarum's built-in methods or a secure random number generator to create strong API keys.
2.  **API Key Storage (Environment Variables/Secrets Management):** Store API keys *outside* of the Flarum codebase (e.g., environment variables).  Never commit them to version control.
3.  **API Key Rotation (Manual/Automated):** Regularly rotate API keys.
4.  **Input Validation & Output Encoding (Extension Development):** If developing custom extensions that interact with the Flarum API, *rigorously* validate all input received from the API and properly encode output using Flarum's built-in functions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):** Weak/compromised API keys.
*   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Via unauthorized API access.
*   **Injection Attacks (XSS, etc.) (High Severity):** Through API interactions in custom extensions.

**Impact:**
*   Reduces risk of unauthorized API access, data breaches, and injection attacks via the API.

**Currently Implemented (Hypothetical):**
*   API keys are used.

**Missing Implementation (Hypothetical):**
*   No API key rotation.
*   No thorough review of input validation/output encoding in custom API interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Discussion and Post Content Handling (Flarum-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_discussion_and_post_content_handling__flarum-centric_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Extension Review (Content-Related):** If using extensions that modify content display (custom BBCode, Markdown), carefully review their code for XSS vulnerabilities, focusing on input handling and sanitization.
2.  **Regular Expression Review (Extensions):** If extensions use regular expressions for parsing, review them for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
3.  **Moderator Training (Content Awareness):** Train moderators to recognize and remove malicious content (scripts, links).
4. **Input Sanitization (Extension Development):** If developing custom extensions, *always* sanitize user input using Flarum's built-in functions (e.g., `s9e\TextFormatter`) before displaying or storing it.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** In user posts.
*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Medium Severity):** From extensions.
*   **Malicious Content (Medium Severity):** Posted by users.

**Impact:**
*   Reduces risk of XSS, ReDoS, and malicious content exposure.

**Currently Implemented (Hypothetical):**
*   Flarum's built-in sanitization is used.
*   Moderators have general awareness.

**Missing Implementation (Hypothetical):**
*   No systematic extension code review (content-related).
*   No regular expression audits.
*   No formal moderator training on malicious content.
