# Threat Model Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Threat: [Malicious Extension Installation](./threats/malicious_extension_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious extension disguised as a legitimate one.  They use social engineering or exploit vulnerabilities in the Flarum extension ecosystem (e.g., a compromised extension repository, if one existed) to convince an administrator to install it. The extension contains code that steals data, modifies the forum, or installs backdoors. This leverages Flarum's core extensibility feature.
*   **Impact:** Complete forum compromise, data breach, data loss, reputational damage, potential legal consequences.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:**  `flarum/extend` (Extension Manager), and potentially *any* part of Flarum core or other extensions, depending on the malicious code's actions. The extension's files (PHP, `composer.json`) are the direct attack vector.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer (Flarum Core):**  Implement code signing for extensions (long-term, requires significant core changes).  Provide robust security guidelines for extension developers.
    *   **User (Admin):**  *Only* install extensions from trusted sources (official Flarum community, well-known developers with a strong reputation).  Carefully review extension source code (if available and you have the expertise) before installation.  Use a staging environment to test extensions before production deployment.  Monitor the Flarum community for reports of malicious extensions.

## Threat: [Extension Vulnerability Exploitation (Privilege Escalation)](./threats/extension_vulnerability_exploitation__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a legitimately installed Flarum extension to gain elevated privileges.  This allows them to bypass Flarum's permission system and perform actions normally restricted to moderators or administrators.  The vulnerability might be in how the extension interacts with Flarum's authorization mechanisms (Gates, Policies).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify forum content and settings, potential for complete forum compromise (if admin privileges are obtained).
*   **Flarum Component Affected:** The vulnerable extension, specifically its permission handling logic (often within controllers or middleware that interact with Flarum's `Gate` or `Policy` classes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer (Extension):**  Rigorously test the extension's permission system.  Use Flarum's built-in authorization mechanisms (Gates and Policies) consistently and correctly.  Avoid custom permission logic whenever possible.  Follow secure coding practices.
    *   **User (Admin):**  Keep all extensions updated to the latest versions.  Regularly audit user permissions and group memberships.  Limit the number of users with elevated privileges.

## Threat: [Administrator Account Compromise (via Flarum-Specific Attack)](./threats/administrator_account_compromise__via_flarum-specific_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets Flarum-specific authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain administrator access.  This is *not* a generic password attack, but rather exploitation of a vulnerability in Flarum's core session management, a password reset extension, or a social login extension (e.g., `fof/oauth`). The attacker might exploit a flaw in how Flarum handles sessions, tokens, or user authentication flows.
*   **Impact:** Complete forum compromise, data breach, data loss, reputational damage.
*   **Flarum Component Affected:**  `flarum/core` (session management, authentication controllers), and potentially extensions related to authentication (e.g., `fof/oauth`, custom password reset extensions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer (Flarum Core & Extension):**  Ensure core Flarum and authentication-related extensions follow secure coding practices for session management, password handling, and OAuth flows.  Implement robust CSRF protection.  Regularly conduct security audits.
    *   **User (Admin):**  Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* administrator accounts (using a trusted extension).  Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.  Regularly review administrator account activity logs (if available through extensions).

## Threat: [Unmaintained Extension Vulnerabilities](./threats/unmaintained_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an unmaintained Flarum extension. The extension's developer is no longer providing updates, leaving the vulnerability unpatched. The attacker leverages this to compromise the forum, potentially gaining elevated privileges or accessing sensitive data. This is a direct consequence of Flarum's reliance on community-developed extensions.
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, ranging from data leaks to complete forum takeover.
* **Flarum Component Affected:** The specific unmaintained extension.
* **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer (Extension):** If maintaining an extension, commit to providing timely security updates or clearly mark the extension as unmaintained and suggest alternatives.
    * **User (Admin):** Regularly review installed extensions and identify any that are no longer maintained. Replace unmaintained extensions with actively supported alternatives. If no alternative exists, consider commissioning a developer to patch the vulnerability or remove the extension entirely. This is a *critical* ongoing maintenance task.
