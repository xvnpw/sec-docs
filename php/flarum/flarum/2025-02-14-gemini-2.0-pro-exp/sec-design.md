Okay, let's create a design document for the Flarum project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Flarum is an open-source forum software aiming to be simple, fast, and user-friendly. Its business priorities revolve around:

-   Growing a large and active user base (both forum administrators and forum users).
-   Maintaining a vibrant and engaged community of developers and contributors.
-   Providing a modern, extensible, and easy-to-use platform for online discussions.
-   Ensuring the software is performant and scalable to handle forums of varying sizes.
-   Offering a compelling alternative to existing, often more complex, forum solutions.

Key business risks that need to be addressed:

-   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or data breaches.
-   Loss of user trust and adoption due to instability or poor performance.
-   Inability to attract and retain contributors, leading to stagnation of the project.
-   Competition from other forum software providers.
-   Failure to adapt to evolving user needs and web technologies.
-   Legal risks associated with user-generated content (copyright infringement, illegal content).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Flarum, being a PHP application, inherits the security considerations of the LAMP/LEMP stack. It also has specific security controls and accepted risks:

-   security control: Input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS and SQL injection. Implemented throughout the codebase, particularly in data handling and rendering components.
-   security control: Use of prepared statements for database interactions to mitigate SQL injection risks. Implemented in the database access layer.
-   security control: CSRF protection mechanisms to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. Implemented in the form handling and API endpoints.
-   security control: Password hashing using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt). Implemented in the user authentication module.
-   security control: Access controls to restrict administrative functionalities to authorized users. Implemented in the middleware and authorization components.
-   security control: Regular security updates and patches to address vulnerabilities. Managed through the Flarum release process and extension ecosystem.
-   security control: Extension system with permission management. Implemented in the extension API and core functionality.
-   security control: Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service. Implemented in the API and authentication endpoints.
-   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party extensions for some functionalities, which may introduce their own security risks. Mitigated by community vetting and security reviews, but not entirely eliminated.
-   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in the underlying PHP framework (Laravel) and its dependencies. Mitigated by staying up-to-date with framework releases and security advisories.
-   accepted risk: User-generated content may contain malicious links or scripts. Mitigated by content filtering and user reporting mechanisms, but complete prevention is impossible.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

-   Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks further.
-   Introduce security scanning tools (SAST, DAST) into the development and release pipeline.
-   Establish a clear security vulnerability disclosure program.
-   Provide comprehensive security documentation and guidelines for extension developers.
-   Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced user account security.

Security Requirements:

-   Authentication:
    -   Secure password storage using strong hashing algorithms.
    -   Protection against brute-force attacks.
    -   Session management with secure cookies (HTTPOnly, Secure flags).
    -   Optional support for 2FA.
-   Authorization:
    -   Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing user permissions.
    -   Granular control over forum access and functionalities.
    -   Secure handling of API keys and tokens.
-   Input Validation:
    -   Strict validation and sanitization of all user inputs.
    -   Prevention of XSS, SQL injection, and other injection attacks.
    -   Safe handling of file uploads.
-   Cryptography:
    -   Use of strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data (if applicable).
    -   Secure generation and management of cryptographic keys.
    -   HTTPS enforcement for all communication.

Flarum can be deployed in several ways, including:

1.  Traditional LAMP/LEMP stack on a single server.
2.  Cloud-based deployment using managed services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
3.  Containerized deployment using Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

We'll describe the containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes, as it offers scalability, resilience, and easier management.

## BUILD

Flarum's build process involves several steps, from development to the creation of release artifacts. While Flarum doesn't have a complex CI/CD pipeline in the main repository, a secure build process should include:

1.  Development: Developers write code and commit changes to the Git repository.
2.  Code Review: Pull requests are reviewed by other developers for code quality and security.
3.  Automated Testing: Unit and integration tests are run automatically on each commit or pull request.
4.  Static Analysis: Static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) are used to identify potential code quality and security issues.
5.  Dependency Management: Dependencies are managed using Composer, and their versions are pinned to prevent unexpected updates.
6.  Vulnerability Scanning: Dependency vulnerability scanners (e.g., Composer audit, Snyk) are used to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
7.  Release Build: When a new release is tagged, a build process creates the release artifacts (e.g., a ZIP archive containing the Flarum files).
8.  Artifact Signing: Release artifacts can be signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
