*   **Threat:** Malicious Extension Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially a forum administrator with insufficient security awareness or whose account is compromised, installs a malicious Flarum extension. This extension could contain code designed to steal data, inject malicious scripts, create backdoor accounts, or disrupt forum functionality. The attacker might upload the extension through the admin panel or manipulate the file system if they have server access.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise (attacker gains control of user accounts), data breaches (sensitive user data is stolen), defacement (the forum's appearance is altered), denial of service (the forum becomes unavailable), creation of persistent backdoors for future access.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flarum's Extension System, specifically the loading and execution of third-party code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   For Developers: Implement code review processes for extensions. Use static analysis tools. Follow secure coding practices.
        *   For Users/Administrators: Only install extensions from trusted sources. Review extension code before installation if possible. Keep extensions updated. Implement strong access controls for the administrative panel. Regularly audit installed extensions.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Extension Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a security vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, remote code execution) within a poorly coded or outdated Flarum extension. They might craft specific requests or inject malicious payloads through user inputs or API calls handled by the vulnerable extension.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data breaches, defacement, denial of service, potential for server compromise depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable Flarum extension and its associated code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   For Developers: Follow secure coding practices when developing extensions. Regularly update dependencies. Implement proper input validation and output encoding. Conduct security testing.
        *   For Users/Administrators: Keep all extensions updated to the latest versions. Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities in installed extensions. Consider disabling or removing extensions that are no longer maintained or have known unpatched vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Stored XSS through Insufficient Flarum Sanitization
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-generated content (e.g., posts, signatures, profile fields) that is not properly sanitized by Flarum. When other users view this content, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting them to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flarum's input sanitization and output encoding mechanisms, particularly in areas handling user-generated content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   For Developers: Ensure robust input validation and output encoding are implemented throughout Flarum's codebase. Utilize security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP). Regularly review and update sanitization libraries.
        *   For Users/Administrators: Keep Flarum updated to benefit from the latest security patches. Consider using extensions that provide additional XSS protection.

*   **Threat:** API Endpoint Vulnerabilities (If API is Enabled)
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Flarum's API endpoints, such as missing authentication checks, insecure data handling, or injection flaws. This could allow them to access or modify data without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flarum's API endpoints and associated logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   For Developers: Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API endpoints. Follow secure coding practices for API development. Validate and sanitize all input received by the API. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
        *   For Users/Administrators: If the API is not needed, disable it. Secure API keys and tokens.
