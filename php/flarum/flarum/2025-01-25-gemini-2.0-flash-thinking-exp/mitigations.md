## Mitigation Strategy: [Extension Security Management (Flarum Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/extension_security_management__flarum_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Audit Installed Extensions (Flarum Extensions)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Inventory Flarum Extensions:** Create a list of all currently installed Flarum extensions within your Flarum installation. You can typically find this list in the Flarum admin panel under the "Extensions" section or by listing the contents of the `extensions` directory in your Flarum installation.
        2.  **Assess Necessity for Flarum Functionality:** For each listed extension, evaluate if it is still essential for your Flarum forum's intended features and user experience. Remove any extensions that are no longer needed or provide redundant functionality.
        3.  **Check Extension Maintenance Status (Flarum Ecosystem):** Verify if each extension is actively maintained within the Flarum ecosystem. Look for recent updates on Extiverse (if listed), the extension's GitHub repository (if available), or discussions on the official Flarum community forums. Consider replacing extensions that appear abandoned or haven't been updated for a long time with actively maintained alternatives if possible.
        4.  **Source Verification within Flarum Ecosystem:** Confirm the source of each extension. Prioritize extensions installed via Extiverse or directly from developers known and trusted within the Flarum community. Be cautious about extensions obtained from less reputable or unknown sources outside of the established Flarum ecosystem.
        5.  **Schedule Regular Audits (Flarum Admin Task):**  Establish a schedule for periodic reviews of your installed Flarum extensions (e.g., quarterly or semi-annually). Add this task to your Flarum administration checklist to ensure ongoing extension security management.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromised Flarum Extension (High Severity):** Malicious code embedded within a Flarum extension can directly compromise your Flarum forum, leading to data breaches, unauthorized administrative access, and defacement. This is a threat specific to Flarum's extension-based architecture.
        *   **Vulnerable Flarum Extension (High Severity):** Outdated or poorly coded Flarum extensions can introduce security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, insecure file handling) directly into your Flarum application, making it susceptible to attacks.
    *   **Impact:** **High Reduction** in risk from compromised or vulnerable Flarum extensions. Proactive auditing, focused on the Flarum extension ecosystem, significantly reduces the attack surface specific to Flarum.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** **Partially Implemented.** Flarum itself provides the "Extensions" admin panel for listing and managing extensions. Extiverse (a Flarum-specific service) offers a platform for discovering and (often) verifying extensions. However, proactive auditing is a manual administrative task.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** **Automated Extension Security Checks within Flarum.** Flarum could potentially integrate features to automatically check extensions against known vulnerability databases or provide warnings about extensions with poor maintenance records or from unverified sources within the Flarum ecosystem.  A built-in reminder system for administrators to perform extension audits would also be beneficial.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Install Extensions from Reputable Sources Only (Flarum Ecosystem Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/install_extensions_from_reputable_sources_only__flarum_ecosystem_focus_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Install Extensions from Reputable Sources Only (Flarum Ecosystem Focus)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Prioritize Extiverse (Flarum Official Extension Hub):** When searching for Flarum extensions, primarily utilize Extiverse, the official Flarum extensions hub. Extensions listed on Extiverse generally undergo a basic level of review and are often from established Flarum developers.
        2.  **Developer Reputation within Flarum Community:** For extensions not on Extiverse, research the developer's reputation within the Flarum community. Look for developers who are active in the Flarum forums, have contributed to Flarum core or other reputable extensions, or have a proven track record of creating quality Flarum extensions.
        3.  **Community Feedback on Flarum Forums/Extiverse:**  Read reviews and community feedback specifically related to Flarum extensions on platforms like Extiverse or the official Flarum forums before installing. Pay attention to discussions about security, stability, or potential issues reported by other Flarum users.
        4.  **Exercise Caution with Untrusted Sources (Outside Flarum Ecosystem):** Be extremely cautious about installing Flarum extensions from unknown websites, forums outside the official Flarum community, or direct downloads without clear source verification within the Flarum ecosystem. These sources pose a higher risk of distributing malicious or poorly secured extensions.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Flarum Extension Installation (High Severity):** Installing Flarum extensions from untrusted sources significantly increases the risk of introducing malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities directly into your Flarum forum application. This is a supply chain risk specific to Flarum's extension mechanism.
        *   **Supply Chain Attack via Flarum Extension (High Severity):** Compromised or malicious Flarum extensions act as a direct supply chain attack vector, injecting threats directly into your Flarum installation through its intended extension mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** **High Reduction** in risk of installing malicious Flarum extensions. Focusing on reputable sources within the Flarum ecosystem is a primary defense against supply chain attacks targeting Flarum via extensions.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** **Partially Implemented.** Flarum and Extiverse encourage using Extiverse as the primary source. The Flarum community generally promotes reputable developers. However, there's no technical enforcement preventing installation from other sources, and user awareness within the Flarum community is crucial.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** **Stronger Source Verification within Flarum Installation Process.** Flarum could potentially integrate stronger source verification mechanisms during extension installation, perhaps with warnings or restrictions for installing extensions not listed on Extiverse or from developers with low community reputation scores.  A system to verify digital signatures of extensions could also enhance trust.
