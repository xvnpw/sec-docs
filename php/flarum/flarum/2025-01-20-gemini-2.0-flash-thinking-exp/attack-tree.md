## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Flarum Core Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_flarum_core_vulnerability.md)

Attack Vectors:
    - Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability in Flarum:
        - Exploit insecure file upload functionality to upload malicious code.
        - Exploit vulnerabilities in image processing libraries to trigger code execution via crafted images.
        - Exploit insecure deserialization vulnerabilities by providing malicious serialized data.
        - Impact: Gain shell access to the server, execute arbitrary commands.
    - Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Flarum:
        - Exploit flaws in the password reset mechanism to gain unauthorized access.
        - Exploit vulnerabilities in session management to hijack user sessions.
        - Exploit flaws in third-party authentication integrations to bypass authentication.
        - Impact: Gain unauthorized access to administrator or user accounts.
    - Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Flarum:
        - Exploit flaws in permission checks or role management to elevate user privileges.
        - Impact: Gain administrator privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerability in Flarum Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerability_in_flarum_extensions.md)

Attack Vectors:
    - Exploit SQL Injection in Extension:
        - Inject malicious SQL queries through vulnerable extension's database interactions.
        - Impact: Gain access to sensitive database information, potentially leading to full compromise.
    - Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Extension:
        - Leverage extension's functionality to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        - Impact: Gain shell access to the server, execute arbitrary commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration or Deployment Weaknesses Specific to Flarum](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_configuration_or_deployment_weaknesses_specific_to_flarum.md)

Attack Vectors:
    - Exploit Default or Weak Administrator Credentials:
        - Attempt to log in using default credentials or common passwords for the administrator account.
        - Impact: Gain immediate administrative access to the Flarum application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Related to Flarum Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_supply_chain_vulnerabilities_related_to_flarum_dependencies.md)

Attack Vectors:
    - Exploit known vulnerability in the dependency:
        - Leverage known security flaws in libraries used by Flarum to compromise the application.
        - Impact: Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the vulnerability.
