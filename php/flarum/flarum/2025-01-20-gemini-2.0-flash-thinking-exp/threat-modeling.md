# Threat Model Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Flarum Core](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_flarum_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization in Flarum Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious serialized objects that, when processed by Flarum's core due to a lack of secure deserialization practices, lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. The attacker might exploit this by submitting specially crafted data through API requests or other input vectors handled by the core.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, installation of malware.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flarum's core components handling data serialization and deserialization (e.g., potentially within session management, caching mechanisms, or queue processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Flarum Core):** Avoid insecure deserialization practices. If deserialization is necessary, use safe methods and carefully validate the input. Employ whitelisting of allowed classes for deserialization. Regularly audit the codebase for deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** Keep Flarum updated to the latest stable version, as security patches often address such critical vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Flaws in Flarum's Core](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_flaws_in_flarum's_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication and Authorization Flaws in Flarum's Core
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist within Flarum's core authentication or authorization mechanisms. An attacker could exploit these flaws to bypass login procedures, escalate their privileges to gain administrative access, or access resources they are not authorized to view or modify. This could involve exploiting logic errors in the authentication middleware, permission checks, or session management.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, administrative functions, and sensitive data. Complete control over the forum.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flarum's core authentication middleware, authorization policies, user management components, and session handling mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Flarum Core):** Implement robust and well-tested authentication and authorization mechanisms. Follow security best practices for password hashing, session management, and access control. Conduct thorough security audits of authentication and authorization code.
        *   **Users:** Enforce strong password policies. Regularly review user permissions and roles. Keep Flarum updated to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Flarum's Core](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_flarum's_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Flarum's Core
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Flarum's core code allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into forum content or other areas managed by the core (e.g., user profiles, settings). This injected script is then executed in the browsers of other users viewing the affected content. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the forum.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the forum.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flarum's core view rendering engine, input sanitization functions within core components, or areas where user-supplied data is displayed without proper escaping.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Flarum Core):** Implement robust output encoding and input sanitization throughout the core codebase. Utilize context-aware escaping techniques. Regularly audit the codebase for XSS vulnerabilities. Follow secure coding practices.
        *   **Users:** Keep Flarum updated to the latest stable version. Be cautious about custom HTML or JavaScript allowed in certain areas (if any).

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through Flarum Core Features](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__through_flarum_core_features.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through Flarum Core Features
    *   **Description:** Certain features within Flarum's core, such as fetching remote avatars or embedding external content, might be exploitable for SSRF attacks if not properly validated. An attacker could provide a malicious URL, causing the Flarum server to make requests to internal network resources or external services on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flarum's core components responsible for fetching remote resources (e.g., avatar handling, embedding functionalities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Flarum Core):** Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs used for fetching remote resources. Use allow-lists for permitted domains or protocols. Avoid directly using user-supplied URLs in requests.
        *   **Users:** Ensure Flarum is running in a secure network environment with appropriate firewall rules. Keep Flarum updated.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Insecure File Upload Handling in Flarum Core](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__through_insecure_file_upload_handling_in_flarum_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Insecure File Upload Handling in Flarum Core
    *   **Description:** If Flarum's core allows file uploads (e.g., for avatars, attachments) and doesn't properly sanitize or validate these files, an attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) that can be executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flarum's core file upload handling mechanisms, storage logic, and validation routines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Flarum Core):** Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension. Sanitize file names. Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism. Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.
        *   **Users:** Ensure Flarum is updated to the latest version. Configure the server environment to restrict execution permissions on upload directories.
