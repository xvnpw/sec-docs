# Attack Surface Analysis for flarum/flarum

## Attack Surface: [Markdown/BBCode Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markdownbbcode_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting flaws in Flarum's parsing of user-submitted content (Markdown or BBCode) to inject malicious scripts or manipulate the page structure.

**How Flarum Contributes:** Flarum's core functionality uses Markdown to format user posts and comments. If this parsing is not securely implemented, it creates an opportunity for injection attacks.

**Example:** A user crafts a forum post containing a malicious `<script>` tag within a Markdown image link, which, when rendered by Flarum, executes arbitrary JavaScript in other users' browsers.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Ensure Flarum is up-to-date. Utilize robust and well-maintained Markdown parsing libraries with proper sanitization and output encoding within the Flarum codebase. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in how Flarum's built-in API endpoints authenticate users and authorize access to resources.

**How Flarum Contributes:** Flarum provides an API for various functionalities. If the authentication or authorization mechanisms within Flarum's API are flawed, attackers can bypass security checks.

**Example:** An API endpoint for creating new users lacks proper rate limiting or input validation within Flarum's code, allowing an attacker to create a large number of spam accounts. Another example is an endpoint allowing modification of user roles without proper authentication checks enforced by Flarum.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data managed by Flarum, modification of data, creation of malicious accounts, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0) within Flarum's API. Enforce strict authorization checks on all API endpoints provided by Flarum, ensuring users can only access resources they are permitted to. Implement rate limiting within Flarum's API handling to prevent abuse. Thoroughly validate all input received by Flarum's API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (if enabled by Flarum core or official extensions)](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_by_flarum_core_or_official_extensions_.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how Flarum handles user-uploaded files, allowing attackers to upload malicious content.

**How Flarum Contributes:** If Flarum's core functionality or officially maintained extensions allow file uploads (e.g., avatars), improper handling by Flarum can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image through Flarum's avatar upload feature. Due to insufficient validation by Flarum, the script is stored and can be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, defacement, information disclosure, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content rather than just the file extension within Flarum's file handling logic. Store uploaded files outside the webroot configured for Flarum. Use a separate domain or subdomain for serving user-uploaded content managed by Flarum. Scan uploaded files for malware within the Flarum application. Implement proper access controls on uploaded files managed by Flarum.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Mechanism Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_mechanism_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** Flaws in Flarum's built-in password reset process that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**How Flarum Contributes:** Flarum provides a password reset functionality. If this is not implemented securely within Flarum's codebase, it can be abused.

**Example:** The password reset link generated by Flarum contains a predictable token, allowing an attacker to guess the token and reset another user's password. Another example is the lack of account lockout after multiple failed reset attempts within Flarum's password reset flow.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Use strong, unpredictable, and time-limited reset tokens generated by Flarum. Implement account lockout after multiple failed reset attempts within Flarum's authentication system. Ensure password reset links are sent over HTTPS. Consider multi-factor authentication for password resets within Flarum.
