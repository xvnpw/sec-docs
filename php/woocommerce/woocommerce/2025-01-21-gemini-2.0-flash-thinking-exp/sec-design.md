**Detailed Data Flow Description (Example: Placing an Order):**

1. **Browse Products:** The customer explores products on the storefront (Presentation Layer), with product information retrieved from the WordPress database (Data Layer) via the WooCommerce plugin (Application Layer).
2. **Add to Cart:** When a customer adds a product to their shopping cart, the cart details are stored in the WordPress database (often utilizing options or custom database tables) and potentially within the user's session for temporary storage.
3. **Proceed to Checkout:** The customer navigates to the checkout page (Presentation Layer). WooCommerce retrieves the current cart contents from the database to display the order summary.
4. **Enter Details:** The customer provides their shipping and billing information through the checkout form. WooCommerce (Application Layer) performs validation on this input data to ensure completeness and correctness.
5. **Select Payment Method:** The customer chooses their preferred payment method. WooCommerce interacts with the corresponding payment gateway (External Systems) to initiate the payment processing sequence.
6. **Submit Order:** Upon final order submission, WooCommerce (Application Layer) undertakes the following actions:
    *   Transmits payment details to the selected Payment Gateway for authorization and processing.
    *   Generates a new order record within the WordPress database (Data Layer), capturing all relevant order information.
    *   Adjusts the inventory levels in the database to reflect the purchased items.
    *   May communicate with a Shipping Provider API (External Systems) to calculate shipping costs and potentially initiate the shipment process.
    *   Dispatches order confirmation notifications to both the customer and the store administrator via email.

## 6. Security Considerations (Initial Overview)

While a dedicated threat modeling exercise will delve deeper into security aspects, the following are key initial security considerations relevant to the WooCommerce architecture:

*   **Robust Input Validation:** Implementing rigorous validation of all user-supplied data (e.g., product descriptions, customer addresses, payment information) to mitigate injection vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
*   **Secure Authentication and Authorization:** Employing secure mechanisms for managing user accounts (both customer and administrative) and enforcing strict access controls to protect sensitive data and functionalities.
*   **Payment Security Compliance:** Adhering to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements when handling payment card data. Utilizing reputable payment gateways and tokenization techniques to safeguard sensitive financial information.
*   **Data Protection Measures:** Implementing appropriate measures to protect sensitive customer and order data, including encryption both during transmission (in transit) and when stored (at rest).
*   **Proactive Vulnerability Management:** Establishing a process for regularly updating WordPress core, the WooCommerce plugin, and all installed extensions to apply security patches and address known vulnerabilities promptly.
*   **Careful Extension Management:** Exercising caution when installing extensions, particularly from unverified sources, as malicious or poorly coded extensions can introduce significant security risks.
*   **Secure Session Management:** Implementing secure session handling practices to prevent session hijacking and unauthorized access.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:** Employing anti-CSRF tokens to prevent malicious exploitation of authenticated user sessions.
*   **Implementation of Security Headers:** Utilizing security-related HTTP headers (e.g., Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)) to enhance browser-side security.
*   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implementing rate limiting mechanisms to protect against brute-force attacks targeting login forms and other sensitive endpoints.
