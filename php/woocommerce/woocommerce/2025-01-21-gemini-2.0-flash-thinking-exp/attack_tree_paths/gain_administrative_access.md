### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Administrative Access

Gaining administrative access to a WooCommerce application represents a critical security breach, granting the attacker complete control over the store, customer data, and potentially the underlying server. Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors and scenarios:

**4.1 Exploiting Authentication Vulnerabilities:**

* **4.1.1 Brute-Force Attacks on Login Page:**
    * **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess administrator credentials by trying numerous username/password combinations.
    * **How it Works:** Automated tools are used to send login requests with different credentials. Lack of rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms makes this feasible.
    * **WooCommerce Specific Considerations:**  The standard WordPress login page (`wp-login.php`) is the primary target. Weak default credentials or easily guessable passwords increase the risk.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong password policies and enforce complexity requirements.
        * Enable account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        * Implement CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to prevent automated attacks.
        * Consider using two-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator accounts.
        * Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.

* **4.1.2 Credential Stuffing:**
    * **Description:** Attackers use previously compromised username/password combinations (obtained from other breaches) to attempt login.
    * **How it Works:** Attackers leverage large databases of leaked credentials.
    * **WooCommerce Specific Considerations:** If administrators use the same credentials across multiple platforms, they are vulnerable.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Encourage administrators to use unique and strong passwords.
        * Implement 2FA.
        * Monitor for login attempts using known compromised credentials (if feasible).

* **4.1.3 Bypassing Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication logic to bypass the login process without valid credentials.
    * **How it Works:** This could involve SQL injection, logic flaws in custom authentication plugins, or exploiting vulnerabilities in WordPress core.
