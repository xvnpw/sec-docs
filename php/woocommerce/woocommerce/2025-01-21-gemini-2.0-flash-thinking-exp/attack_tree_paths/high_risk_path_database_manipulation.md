### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Database Manipulation

**HIGH RISK PATH: Database Manipulation**

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to the underlying database of the WooCommerce application. This can be achieved through SQL injection vulnerabilities or by directly compromising the database server.

    *   **Sub-Path 1: SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

        *   **Description:** SQL injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that exploits security vulnerabilities in the application's SQL database layer. Attackers can insert malicious SQL statements into application input fields (e.g., search bars, login forms, product filters) that are then executed by the database server.
        *   **WooCommerce Context:**  WooCommerce, like many web applications, interacts heavily with its database. Potential injection points could exist in:
            *   **Product Search Functionality:** Malicious SQL in search queries could bypass security checks and retrieve or modify data.
            *   **Filtering and Sorting Options:**  Parameters used for filtering products by category, price, or attributes could be vulnerable.
            *   **User Input Fields:**  Registration forms, checkout processes, and review submissions could be exploited if input is not properly sanitized and parameterized.
            *   **Custom Plugins and Themes:**  Poorly coded plugins or themes interacting with the database are a significant source of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Techniques:**
            *   **Union-based SQLi:**  Combining the results of malicious queries with legitimate ones to extract data.
            *   **Boolean-based blind SQLi:**  Inferring information by observing the application's response to true/false conditions in injected queries.
            *   **Time-based blind SQLi:**  Inferring information by observing delays caused by injected queries.
            *   **Error-based SQLi:**  Exploiting database error messages to gain information about the database structure.
        *   **Impact (Specific to SQLi):**
            *   **Data Breach:**  Retrieval of sensitive customer data (names, addresses, payment information), product details, and order history.
            *   **Data Modification:**  Altering product prices, stock levels, customer details, or even injecting malicious code into database records.
            *   **Data Deletion:**  Deleting critical data, leading to loss of business information and operational disruption.
            *   **Authentication Bypass:**  Circumventing login mechanisms to gain administrative access.

    *   **Sub-Path 2: Direct Database Server Compromise**

        *   **Description:**  This involves directly attacking the database server itself, bypassing the web application layer. This can be achieved through various means:
            *   **Exploiting Database Server Vulnerabilities:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in the database software (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL) can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access.
            *   **Weak Database Credentials:**  Default or easily guessable passwords for database users.
            *   **Misconfigured Database Server:**  Incorrect firewall rules, open ports, or insecure configurations can expose the database server to external attacks.
            *   **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or negligent actions by individuals with legitimate access to the database server.
            *   **Compromised Hosting Environment:** If the underlying server or hosting environment is compromised, the database server is also at risk.
        *   **WooCommerce Context:**  The database server typically resides on the same server as the WooCommerce application or on a separate, dedicated server. Security weaknesses in either scenario can lead to compromise.
        *   **Techniques:**
            *   **Exploiting known vulnerabilities:** Using publicly available exploits for database server software.
            *   **Brute-force attacks:**  Attempting to guess database user credentials.
            *   **Port scanning and service enumeration:** Identifying open ports and running services to find potential entry points.
            *   **Social engineering:**  Tricking authorized personnel into revealing credentials.
        *   **Impact (Specific to Database Server Compromise):**
            *   **Full Database Access:**  Complete control over the database, allowing for unrestricted data manipulation, deletion, and exfiltration.
            *   **Operating System Compromise (Potential):**  In some cases, gaining access to the database server can lead to further exploitation and compromise of the underlying operating system.
            *   **Installation of Backdoors:**  Attackers can install persistent backdoors to maintain access even after vulnerabilities are patched.
            *   **Data Encryption/Ransomware:**  Encrypting the database and demanding a ransom for its recovery.

*   **Impact:** Modification or deletion of critical data, including product information, customer details, and order history, leading to significant disruption and potential financial loss.

    *   **Detailed Impact Analysis:**
        *   **Modification of Product Information:**
