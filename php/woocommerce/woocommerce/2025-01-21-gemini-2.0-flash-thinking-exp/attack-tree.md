## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise WooCommerce Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_woocommerce_application.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_sensitive_data.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_plugintheme_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting security flaws present in third-party plugins or themes installed on the WooCommerce application. These flaws can range from simple input validation issues to more severe vulnerabilities like SQL injection or remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, complete server compromise, and disruption of application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: SQL Injection in Plugin/Theme](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_sql_injection_in_plugintheme.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL code through vulnerable input fields in a plugin or theme. This allows the attacker to bypass security checks and directly interact with the database, potentially extracting sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Theft of customer data, order details, administrative credentials, and potential modification or deletion of data.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Plugin/Theme](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_plugintheme.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into a vulnerable plugin or theme that are then executed in the browsers of other users. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, theft of sensitive information, spreading malware, and damage to the website's reputation.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH: Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Plugin/Theme](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high_risk_path_remote_code_execution__rce__in_plugintheme.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a vulnerability in a plugin or theme that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the WooCommerce application. This is often achieved through file upload vulnerabilities or insecure deserialization.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal any data, install malware, or use the server for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Core WooCommerce Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_core_woocommerce_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting security flaws present in the core WooCommerce codebase itself. These vulnerabilities are typically discovered and patched by the WooCommerce team, making it crucial to keep the core updated.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and disruption of core e-commerce functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Unpatched WooCommerce Core Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_unpatched_woocommerce_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the WooCommerce core that have not been patched by the application administrator. Attackers often target websites running older versions of WooCommerce with publicly available exploits.
*   **Impact:** Similar to exploiting core vulnerabilities, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and disruption of the online store.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Payment Gateway Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_payment_gateway_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the way WooCommerce integrates with payment gateways. This can involve man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept payment information or exploiting flaws in the custom integration code.
*   **Impact:** Theft of credit card details and other sensitive payment information, financial loss for both the store owner and customers, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Access](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_access.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit User Role Management Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_user_role_management_flaws.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in WooCommerce's user role and permission system to elevate an attacker's privileges to an administrative level. This could involve exploiting bugs in the role assignment logic or bypassing authentication checks.
*   **Impact:** Gaining full control over the WooCommerce store, allowing the attacker to modify products, orders, customer data, and even install malicious plugins or themes.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Insecure Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_insecure_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Taking advantage of insecure configurations within the WooCommerce application or its hosting environment. This includes using default credentials for administrative accounts or having overly permissive access controls.
*   **Impact:** Easy access to administrative functionalities, potentially leading to complete takeover of the store.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_functionality.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Database Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_database_manipulation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to the underlying database of the WooCommerce application. This can be achieved through SQL injection vulnerabilities or by directly compromising the database server.
*   **Impact:** Modification or deletion of critical data, including product information, customer details, and order history, leading to significant disruption and potential financial loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Overwhelming the WooCommerce application's server with a high volume of malicious requests, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This can be done through botnets or by exploiting vulnerabilities that consume excessive server resources.
*   **Impact:** Inability for legitimate customers to access the store, resulting in lost sales and damage to the store's reputation.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Manipulate Product or Order Data](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_manipulate_product_or_order_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting input validation flaws in WooCommerce to manipulate product prices, stock levels, or order details. This can be done through malicious scripts or by directly crafting requests to vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Impact:** Financial losses due to altered prices or fraudulent orders, disruption of inventory management, and potential legal issues.
