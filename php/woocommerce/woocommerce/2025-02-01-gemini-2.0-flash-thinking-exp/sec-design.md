# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Online Product Catalog Browsing and Search: Customers need to be able to browse and find products.
 - Shopping Cart and Checkout: Customers need to be able to add items to cart and complete purchases.
 - Payment Processing: Securely processing customer payments is crucial for revenue generation.

 - Customer Account Management: Customers need to manage their accounts and order history.
 - Administrator Access and Store Management: Administrators need to manage the store effectively.
- Data Sensitivity:
 - Customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII): High sensitivity (e.g., names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers). Requires strong protection due to privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
 - Customer Payment Information: High sensitivity (e.g., credit card details, bank account information). Requires PCI DSS compliance and strong encryption.
 - Order Data: Medium sensitivity (e.g., order details, purchased products, shipping addresses). Important for business operations and customer service.
 - Product Data: Low sensitivity (e.g., product names, descriptions, images). Publicly available information.
