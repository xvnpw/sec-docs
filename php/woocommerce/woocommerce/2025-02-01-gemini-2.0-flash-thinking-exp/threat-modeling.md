# Threat Model Analysis for woocommerce/woocommerce

## Threat: [Product Data Injection (XSS, HTML Injection)](./threats/product_data_injection__xss__html_injection_.md)

*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript or HTML code into WooCommerce product fields like names, descriptions, or attributes. This is done by submitting crafted input through product creation or update forms, or potentially via API calls if input validation is weak. When users view these product pages, the malicious code executes in their browsers.
*   **Impact:** Customer accounts can be compromised (session hijacking), sensitive data stolen (credit card details if forms are injected), users redirected to malicious websites (phishing), website defacement, or malware distribution.
*   **WooCommerce Component Affected:** Product Management Module, Product Display Functionality, Database Storage of Product Data.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all product data fields on both server-side and client-side.
    *   Use output encoding (escaping) when displaying product data on the frontend.
    *   Regularly scan for and patch XSS vulnerabilities in WooCommerce core and extensions.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Threat: [Price and Currency Manipulation](./threats/price_and_currency_manipulation.md)
