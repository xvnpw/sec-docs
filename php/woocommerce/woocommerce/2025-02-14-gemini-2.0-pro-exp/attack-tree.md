## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Goal: Gain Unauthorized Access/Control](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_goal_gain_unauthorized_accesscontrol.md)

*   **[[Attacker Goal: Gain Unauthorized Access/Control]]**
    *   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data (customer information, order details, payment data) and/or achieve unauthorized control over the WooCommerce store (modify orders, prices, inventory, install malicious plugins, etc.).
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Potential for significant financial loss, reputational damage, legal consequences, and complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit WooCommerce Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_woocommerce_pluginextension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **[[2. Exploit WooCommerce Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities]]**
    *   **Description:** This represents the attack vector of exploiting vulnerabilities within third-party plugins or extensions added to the core WooCommerce functionality.  Plugins significantly expand the attack surface.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - Due to the large number of available plugins, varying developer security practices, and often-delayed updates.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Can range from data breaches to complete system compromise, depending on the plugin's functionality and the nature of the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Vulnerable Plugin RCE](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_vulnerable_plugin_rce.md)

*   **==2.1== [[Vulnerable Plugin RCE]]**
    *   **Description:**  A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability within a WooCommerce plugin. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking full control of the system.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - While not as common as other plugin vulnerabilities, RCEs do occur, especially in less well-maintained plugins.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Complete system compromise.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High - Requires finding and exploiting the RCE vulnerability.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Sophisticated exploits can be stealthy.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Outdated Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_outdated_plugin.md)

*   **==2.2== [[Outdated Plugin]]**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting a known vulnerability in a WooCommerce plugin that has not been updated to the latest version.  This is a very common attack vector.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - Many sites fail to keep plugins updated promptly.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High - Depends on the specific vulnerability in the outdated plugin.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Public exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Vulnerability scanners can easily identify outdated plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Lack of Updates](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_lack_of_updates.md)

*   **==2.2.1== [[Lack of Updates]]**
    *   **Description:**  The direct cause of the "Outdated Plugin" vulnerability.  The site administrator has not applied available security updates for the plugin.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - A common administrative oversight.
    *   **Impact:** (Inherited from 2.2)
    *   **Effort:** N/A - This is a condition, not an attacker action.
    *   **Skill Level:** N/A
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 Vulnerable Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_vulnerable_dependency.md)

*   **[2.2.2 Vulnerable Dependency]**
    *   **Description:** The plugin itself is not directly vulnerable, but it relies on another library (a dependency) that *is* vulnerable.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Weaknesses in WooCommerce Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_weaknesses_in_woocommerce_configuration.md)

*   **[[3. Exploit Weaknesses in WooCommerce Configuration]]**
    *    **Description:** This represents attacks that leverage misconfigurations or insecure settings within the WooCommerce installation itself, rather than code vulnerabilities.
    *    **Likelihood:** High - Configuration errors are common.
    *    **Impact:** High - Can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other serious consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Weak/Default Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_weakdefault_admin_credentials.md)

*   **==3.2== [[Weak/Default Admin Credentials]]**
    *   **Description:**  The WooCommerce administrator account uses a weak password (easily guessable) or the default password has not been changed.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Unfortunately, still a prevalent issue.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Grants full administrative access to the attacker.
    *   **Effort:** Very Low - Brute-forcing, dictionary attacks, or credential stuffing.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium - Failed login attempts can be logged, but successful logins might not be immediately suspicious.
