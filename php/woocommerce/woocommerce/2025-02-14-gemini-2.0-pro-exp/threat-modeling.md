# Threat Model Analysis for woocommerce/woocommerce

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Customer Data via REST API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_customer_data_via_rest_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a WooCommerce *core* component or a *default* WooCommerce configuration related to the REST API to gain unauthorized access to customer data (names, addresses, email addresses, order history, etc.). This differs from the previous version by focusing on core or default setup vulnerabilities, *not* third-party extensions. The attacker might use leaked API keys, brute-force weak API credentials, or exploit a zero-day vulnerability in WooCommerce itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach of sensitive customer PII.
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Legal and financial penalties (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
    *   Loss of customer trust.
    *   Potential for identity theft and fraud.
*   **WooCommerce Component Affected:** WooCommerce REST API, specifically endpoints related to customers (`/wp-json/wc/v3/customers`, etc.). Default authentication methods and configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong, unique API keys and secrets.
    *   Implement OAuth 2.0 for API authentication (if using external applications).
    *   Regularly rotate API keys.
    *   Restrict API access to specific IP addresses (if feasible).
    *   Implement rate limiting and throttling on API endpoints.
    *   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Ensure proper authorization checks are in place for all API endpoints (least privilege).
    *   Keep WooCommerce core *immediately* updated to the latest version to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Order Manipulation via Checkout Process Vulnerability (WooCommerce Core or Payment Gateway)](./threats/order_manipulation_via_checkout_process_vulnerability__woocommerce_core_or_payment_gateway_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the *core* WooCommerce checkout process or a *widely used, officially supported* payment gateway integration to modify order details. This could involve changing the price, quantity, shipping address, or product variations before the order is finalized. The attacker might use techniques like parameter tampering, focusing on vulnerabilities within WooCommerce's core logic or the official payment gateway's handling of data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Financial loss due to reduced prices or altered quantities.
    *   Fulfillment of fraudulent orders.
    *   Inventory discrepancies.
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Customer dissatisfaction.
*   **WooCommerce Component Affected:** WooCommerce core checkout functions, `WC_Checkout`, *officially supported* payment gateway integrations (e.g., `WC_Gateway_Stripe`, `WC_Gateway_Paypal` – those maintained *by* Automattic or a very close partner).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep WooCommerce core and *all officially supported* payment gateway plugins updated to the latest versions *immediately*.
    *   Use reputable and well-maintained payment gateways from the official WooCommerce extensions directory.
    *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization on all checkout form fields (though this is primarily WooCommerce's responsibility).
    *   Use server-side validation to verify order details before processing (again, core WooCommerce functionality).
    *   Monitor order logs for suspicious modifications.
    *   Use a WAF with rules specific to WooCommerce checkout (though this is more general protection).

## Threat: [Payment Gateway Integration Bypass (Official Gateways)](./threats/payment_gateway_integration_bypass__official_gateways_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses the intended payment flow of an *officially supported* WooCommerce payment gateway, potentially submitting orders without actually paying or manipulating payment data. This focuses on vulnerabilities within the official integration code, not third-party gateways.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Financial loss due to unpaid orders.
    *   Fulfillment of fraudulent orders.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **WooCommerce Component Affected:**  `WC_Order` class, *officially supported* payment gateway integration classes (e.g., `WC_Gateway_Paypal`, `WC_Gateway_Stripe` – those maintained by Automattic or a very close partner).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use payment gateways that support server-side payment verification (standard for official gateways).
    *   Implement strong server-side validation of order totals and payment status (core WooCommerce functionality).
    *   Use webhooks provided by the payment gateway to receive real-time payment notifications (and ensure these are properly handled by WooCommerce).
    *   Monitor order logs for discrepancies between order status and payment status.
    *   Keep *officially supported* payment gateway plugins updated to the latest versions *immediately*.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in WooCommerce Core Leading to RCE or Data Breach](./threats/vulnerability_in_woocommerce_core_leading_to_rce_or_data_breach.md)

* **Description:** A zero-day or unpatched vulnerability exists in the *core* WooCommerce plugin itself, allowing for Remote Code Execution (RCE) or direct access to sensitive data. This is a high-impact, low-probability event, but must be considered.
* **Impact:**
    * Complete site compromise.
    * Data breach of all WooCommerce data (customers, orders, products).
    * Defacement.
    * Installation of malware.
    * Loss of control over the website.
* **WooCommerce Component Affected:** Any part of the WooCommerce core codebase.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Immediate** updates to the latest WooCommerce version upon release. This is the *primary* defense.
    * Implement a robust Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules updated frequently to catch emerging threats.
    * Monitor security advisories and news related to WooCommerce.
    * Consider a bug bounty program if running a very large or high-profile WooCommerce store.
    * Implement strong server-level security measures (though this is outside the direct scope of WooCommerce).
    * Regular security audits and penetration testing.
