## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path represents a significant threat due to the extensive WooCommerce plugin ecosystem and the frequent discovery of vulnerabilities within these extensions.
    *   Attackers often target publicly known vulnerabilities in popular plugins, making this a readily available attack vector.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences like remote code execution or database breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_plugin.md)

*   This is a crucial initial step for attackers targeting plugin vulnerabilities.
    *   Attackers can use automated tools and vulnerability databases to identify plugins with known weaknesses.
    *   Success here opens the door for subsequent exploitation attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Publicly Known Vulnerability (e.g., CVE)](./attack_tree_paths/publicly_known_vulnerability__e_g___cve_.md)

*   These are vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and often have readily available exploit code or proof-of-concepts.
    *   Their existence significantly lowers the barrier to entry for attackers.
    *   Focusing on patching these vulnerabilities is a high priority for mitigation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_plugin.md)

*   This represents a severe outcome where an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Achieving RCE allows for complete control over the application and underlying system.
    *   It is a highly impactful vulnerability that is often targeted.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_plugin.md)

*   This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to data breaches, data modification, or even complete database takeover.
    *   It is a common and well-understood attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Admin Dashboard](./attack_tree_paths/access_admin_dashboard.md)

*   Gaining access to the administrative interface provides attackers with extensive control over the WooCommerce store and potentially the entire application.
    *   This can be achieved through various means, including exploiting vulnerabilities or using compromised credentials.
    *   It is a primary goal for many attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Customer Data](./attack_tree_paths/steal_customer_data.md)

*   This represents a significant data breach, potentially exposing sensitive customer information like names, addresses, emails, and purchase history.
    *   This can have severe legal, financial, and reputational consequences for the application owner.
    *   It is a common objective for attackers targeting e-commerce platforms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stealing Payment Information](./attack_tree_paths/stealing_payment_information.md)

*   This is a highly critical outcome involving the theft of sensitive payment details, such as credit card numbers or other financial data.
    *   This can lead to direct financial loss for customers and severe penalties for the application owner due to PCI DSS compliance requirements.
    *   Protecting payment information is paramount for e-commerce security.
