# Threat Model Analysis for woocommerce/woocommerce

## Threat: [Payment Data Interception via WooCommerce Vulnerability](./threats/payment_data_interception_via_woocommerce_vulnerability.md)

**- Threat:** Payment Data Interception via WooCommerce Vulnerability
    - **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the WooCommerce core codebase itself (not necessarily a payment gateway plugin) that allows them to intercept or access sensitive payment information during the checkout process. This could involve weaknesses in how WooCommerce handles and transmits payment data before it reaches the gateway, or vulnerabilities that expose stored payment information if WooCommerce is incorrectly configured to store it (which is generally discouraged).
    - **Impact:** Significant financial loss for customers, severe reputational damage for the store, potential legal and regulatory penalties (e.g., PCI DSS violations).
    - **Affected Component:** `WC_Checkout` class, payment processing logic within WooCommerce core, potentially temporary storage mechanisms for payment data during checkout.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure HTTPS is enforced across the entire website, especially the checkout process.
        - Avoid storing sensitive payment data directly within WooCommerce. Rely on secure payment gateways.
        - Regularly update WooCommerce and all related components to patch known vulnerabilities.
        - Implement security headers to mitigate common web attacks.
        - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the WooCommerce core.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through WooCommerce Roles](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_woocommerce_roles.md)

**- Threat:** Privilege Escalation through WooCommerce Roles
    - **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the core WooCommerce codebase manages user roles and permissions to gain unauthorized access to higher-level administrative functions. This could involve flaws in role assignment logic or insecure default configurations within WooCommerce core.
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the online store, allowing the attacker to modify any data, install malicious code, access sensitive customer information, and potentially take down the site.
    - **Affected Component:** WooCommerce user role management system, specifically functions related to user capabilities and role assignment (e.g., `add_cap()`, `has_cap()`) within the core WooCommerce codebase, potentially database entries related to user roles (`wp_usermeta` table) managed by WooCommerce.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning user roles within WooCommerce.
        - Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions managed by WooCommerce.
        - Avoid using default administrator credentials.
        - Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts.
        - Keep WooCommerce updated to the latest version.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Order Creation/Modification (Core Vulnerability)](./threats/unauthorized_order_creationmodification__core_vulnerability_.md)

**- Threat:** Unauthorized Order Creation/Modification (Core Vulnerability)
    - **Description:** An attacker bypasses the standard checkout process or exploits vulnerabilities directly within WooCommerce core's order management functions to create fraudulent orders, modify existing order details (like shipping address or items), or mark orders as paid without actual payment. This would involve flaws in the core `WC_Order` class or related functions.
    - **Impact:** Financial losses due to unpaid orders, logistical confusion and costs associated with incorrect shipments, potential legal issues if sensitive customer data is compromised.
    - **Affected Component:** `WC_Order` class and related functions for order creation, retrieval, and modification (e.g., `create()`, `update()`, `set_status()`) within the WooCommerce core, checkout process logic (`WC_Checkout`).
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement strong server-side validation for all order data within the WooCommerce core.
        - Regularly audit and secure the core WooCommerce code related to order processing.
        - Implement logging and monitoring of order creation and modification activities within WooCommerce.
        - Use non-guessable order IDs and implement checks within the core to prevent sequential order ID manipulation.

## Threat: [REST API Authentication Bypass or Data Exposure (Core Vulnerability)](./threats/rest_api_authentication_bypass_or_data_exposure__core_vulnerability_.md)

**- Threat:** REST API Authentication Bypass or Data Exposure (Core Vulnerability)
    - **Description:** If the WooCommerce REST API is enabled, attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in its core authentication mechanisms or authorization logic to bypass security checks and access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions (e.g., retrieving customer data, modifying orders, creating products). This would involve flaws in the core WooCommerce REST API implementation.
    - **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of store data, potential for financial losses.
    - **Affected Component:** WooCommerce REST API endpoints and authentication/authorization middleware within the core.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure proper authentication is enforced for all sensitive API endpoints within the WooCommerce core.
        - Use secure API keys and manage them carefully.
        - Implement rate limiting on the core WooCommerce REST API to prevent brute-force attacks on API credentials.
        - Regularly review and update the WooCommerce REST API documentation and security best practices.
        - Disable the REST API if it's not actively being used.
