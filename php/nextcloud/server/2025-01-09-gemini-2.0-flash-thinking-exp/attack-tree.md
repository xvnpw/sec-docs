## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Nextcloud Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_nextcloud_server.md)

This is the overarching goal and represents the starting point for all high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nextcloud Core Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nextcloud_core_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This is a critical node as successful exploitation of core vulnerabilities can lead to complete compromise of the Nextcloud instance and the applications it supports.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerability [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerability__critical_.md)

This critical node represents the exploitation of publicly known vulnerabilities in the Nextcloud core. This is a high-risk path because these vulnerabilities are often well-documented, and exploits may be readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Attackers aim to execute arbitrary code on the Nextcloud server. This can be achieved through vulnerabilities in areas like:
            *   Unsafe handling of uploaded files.
            *   Deserialization vulnerabilities.
            *   Exploiting flaws in image processing libraries.
            *   Abusing specific server-side functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__critical_.md)

This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into database interactions. This can allow them to:
            *   Read sensitive data from the database.
            *   Modify or delete data.
            *   Potentially gain access to the underlying operating system in some scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass__critical_.md)

This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Attackers exploit flaws in Nextcloud's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access. This can involve:
            *   Exploiting weaknesses in session management.
            *   Bypassing password reset functionalities.
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in API authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nextcloud App Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nextcloud_app_vulnerabilities.md)

This is a high-risk path because third-party apps often have less rigorous security reviews than the core Nextcloud software, making them a potential entry point for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in a Third-Party App](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_a_third-party_app.md)

This high-risk path involves targeting vulnerabilities within applications installed from the Nextcloud app store. Attack vectors can include:
        *   XSS vulnerabilities within the app's UI.
        *   SQL injection vulnerabilities within the app's database interactions.
        *   Authentication and authorization flaws within the app.
        *   Remote code execution vulnerabilities specific to the app.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nextcloud Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nextcloud_configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses__critical_.md)

This is a critical node and a high-risk path because misconfigurations are common and can create easy pathways for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__critical_.md)

This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Attackers exploit the use of default or weak passwords for administrative accounts. This provides immediate and high-level access to the Nextcloud instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Network Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_network_configuration.md)

This is a high-risk path. Attackers exploit open ports or misconfigured firewall rules to gain unauthorized access. This can allow them to:
        *   Access the Nextcloud server directly.
        *   Access internal services running on the same network.
        *   Potentially pivot to other systems within the network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Outdated Nextcloud Version [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/outdated_nextcloud_version__critical_.md)

This is a critical node and a high-risk path. Running an outdated version of Nextcloud exposes the system to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in later versions. Attackers can leverage readily available exploits for these vulnerabilities.
