## 7. Deployment Model

Nextcloud Server's flexibility allows for deployment in various environments, each with its own security implications:

*   **On-Premises:**  Offers maximum control over data and infrastructure security but requires the organization to manage all aspects of security.
*   **Cloud-Based (IaaS):**  Deployed on cloud infrastructure, sharing security responsibilities with the cloud provider (e.g., physical security, network infrastructure). Requires careful configuration of virtual machines and network settings.
*   **Cloud-Based (PaaS/Managed Hosting):** Utilizing managed Nextcloud hosting providers simplifies deployment and management, with the provider handling many security aspects. It's crucial to understand the provider's security practices.

The chosen deployment model significantly influences the division of security responsibilities and the specific security measures that need to be implemented.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   The underlying operating system and hardware infrastructure are assumed to be securely configured and maintained.
*   The Web Server is assumed to be configured with best security practices, including appropriate security headers and modules.
*   The Database Server is assumed to be configured with strong passwords, proper access controls, and regular security updates.
*   The Storage Backend is assumed to provide reliable and secure storage, potentially with encryption at rest.
*   Optional external services are assumed to be securely configured and maintained according to their respective best practices.

## 9. Out of Scope

This document remains focused on the core Nextcloud Server architecture and its primary components. The following areas are explicitly considered out of scope:

*   Detailed design specifications of individual Nextcloud applications (e.g., specific features of Calendar, Contacts, Talk).
*   In-depth implementation details of the client applications (web, desktop, mobile).
*   Detailed design of the underlying network infrastructure on which Nextcloud is deployed.
*   Specific deployment configurations and procedures for various environments.
