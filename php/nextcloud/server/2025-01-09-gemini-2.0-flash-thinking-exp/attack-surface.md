# Attack Surface Analysis for nextcloud/server

## Attack Surface: [Brute-force Attacks on Login Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_login_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different usernames and passwords against the Nextcloud login page.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server provides a publicly accessible login endpoint and processes authentication requests. Without sufficient protection, it will respond to each login attempt, allowing attackers to systematically try combinations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a bot to send thousands of login requests with common username/password pairs to the `/login` endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Successful brute-force attacks can lead to account takeover, allowing attackers to access user data, modify files, and potentially pivot to other parts of the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts based on IP address or user account. Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed attempts. Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2). Consider implementing CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to deter automated attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) to the Nextcloud server through its file upload functionality.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server provides file upload endpoints and stores uploaded files. If the server doesn't properly validate and sanitize uploaded files, it can become a platform for executing malicious code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the server doesn't prevent execution of PHP in the uploads directory, the attacker can access this script via a web browser and execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful malicious file uploads can lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain full control of the server, compromise data, or use the server for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just file extensions. Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software (e.g., ClamAV integration). Store uploaded files outside of the web root and serve them through a separate, restricted mechanism. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected or Vulnerable API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_or_vulnerable_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Nextcloud exposes various APIs for different functionalities. If these APIs lack proper authentication, authorization, or input validation, they can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server implements and exposes these API endpoints. Vulnerabilities in the API code or its configuration directly create attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint for managing user accounts lacks proper authentication, allowing an attacker to send requests to create, modify, or delete user accounts without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting API vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to functionality, denial of service, or the ability to manipulate the system's state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Thoroughly validate all input data received by API endpoints to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection). Follow secure coding practices when developing API logic. Regularly audit API endpoints for security vulnerabilities. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
