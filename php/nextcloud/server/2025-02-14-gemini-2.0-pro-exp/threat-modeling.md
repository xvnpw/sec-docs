# Threat Model Analysis for nextcloud/server

## Threat: [Malicious App Installation (Server-Side Impact)](./threats/malicious_app_installation__server-side_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Nextcloud app and either publishes it on the official app store (exploiting vulnerabilities in the review process) or uses social engineering to get an administrator to install it.  The app contains server-side code designed to compromise the Nextcloud server, steal data, escalate privileges, or establish a persistent backdoor. This differs from client-side attacks as the malicious code executes on the *server*, not just within a user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach (all user data), data loss, data modification, denial of service, potential lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Nextcloud App Framework, App-accessible API endpoints, Database, File Storage, potentially the entire operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict, multi-stage code review and security testing (static and dynamic analysis) for all submitted apps.  Enforce strong sandboxing and resource limitations for apps.  Use a robust permission system with granular control over app capabilities.  Regularly audit the app store for malicious apps.
    *   **Users/Admins:**  Implement a strict app approval process, requiring administrator review before any app can be installed.  Only install apps from the official Nextcloud app store *and* from highly trusted developers with a proven track record.  Regularly audit installed apps and their permissions.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Flawed Authentication App (Server-Side)](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_flawed_authentication_app__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a *server-side* component of a third-party authentication app (e.g., a flawed SSO integration or a vulnerable 2FA app that has server-side logic). This bypasses Nextcloud's authentication, granting the attacker unauthorized access to the server's resources and potentially other users' accounts. The vulnerability lies within the server-side handling of authentication, not just the client-side presentation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the server and user accounts, data breach, data loss, data modification.
*   **Affected Component:**  Authentication App (specifically the server-side components), Nextcloud Authentication Framework.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Thoroughly vet and security-test any authentication apps, paying particular attention to the server-side components and their interaction with the Nextcloud core.  Use established, well-vetted authentication libraries and protocols.  Implement robust input validation and error handling.
    *   **Users/Admins:** Use only well-known and reputable authentication apps that have undergone independent security audits.  Keep authentication apps updated to the latest versions.  Monitor server and authentication logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Server Configuration Tampering](./threats/server_configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Nextcloud server's file system (e.g., through a separate server vulnerability, compromised SSH keys, or a misconfigured web server) and directly modifies the `config.php` file or other critical configuration files.  This allows the attacker to disable security features, change database credentials, inject malicious code that executes on the server, or redirect traffic to a malicious server.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, data loss, data modification, denial of service, potential for further exploitation.
*   **Affected Component:** `config.php`, other configuration files, Nextcloud core, potentially the entire operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) for configuration files, alerting administrators to any unauthorized changes.  Store sensitive configuration data securely (e.g., using environment variables, a dedicated secrets management system, or encrypted configuration files).  Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored directly in `config.php`.
    *   **Users/Admins:**  Secure the server's operating system and file system permissions, strictly limiting access to configuration files.  Regularly back up configuration files to a secure, offline location.  Use strong, unique passwords and SSH keys for server access.  Implement multi-factor authentication for server access.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Core Server Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_core_server_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the core Nextcloud server code (e.g., a flaw in a PHP module, a misconfigured API endpoint, or a buffer overflow) to gain elevated privileges on the server.  This could allow the attacker to escalate from a limited user account (or even an unauthenticated state) to a system-level account, granting full control over the Nextcloud server and potentially the underlying operating system.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach (all user data), data loss, data modification, denial of service, potential lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Core Nextcloud Server Code (PHP modules, API endpoints), potentially the entire operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Adhere to secure coding practices (input validation, output encoding, proper error handling, least privilege).  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, including both static and dynamic analysis.  Implement a robust vulnerability management program with rapid patching of discovered vulnerabilities.  Use memory-safe languages or libraries where possible.
    *   **Users/Admins:** Keep Nextcloud server updated to the *latest* stable version, applying security patches immediately upon release.  Subscribe to Nextcloud security advisories.  Run Nextcloud with the least privilege necessary (avoid running as root).  Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to help mitigate some exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Direct Database Access (Server-Side)](./threats/data_tampering_via_direct_database_access__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the database server used by Nextcloud, bypassing the Nextcloud application layer.  This could be through a compromised database user account, a misconfigured database server (allowing remote access), or a Nextcloud-specific SQL injection vulnerability within a server-side component of an app. The attacker can then directly modify, delete, or steal data stored in the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, data modification, integrity violation, potential for denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Database Server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), Database Connector in Nextcloud, potentially vulnerable Nextcloud apps.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Sanitize *all* database inputs within Nextcloud and its apps, even if general SQLi is handled separately (app-specific vulnerabilities are relevant here).  Use prepared statements and parameterized queries exclusively.  Implement robust input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Users/Admins:** Use strong, unique passwords for the database user account.  Restrict database access to *only* the Nextcloud application server and necessary administrative hosts (using firewall rules and database configuration).  Implement network-level firewalling to prevent direct access to the database port from untrusted sources.  Regularly back up the database to a secure, offline location.  Enable database audit logging to track all database queries and modifications.
