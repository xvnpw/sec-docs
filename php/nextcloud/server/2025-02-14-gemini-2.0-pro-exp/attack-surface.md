# Attack Surface Analysis for nextcloud/server

## Attack Surface: [1. File Storage and Synchronization (Core)](./attack_surfaces/1__file_storage_and_synchronization__core_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how Nextcloud *stores, retrieves, and synchronizes files*, including interactions with underlying storage backends. This is the core server-side functionality.
*   **Server Contribution:** Nextcloud's core server code handles all file operations, including access control, versioning, encryption (if enabled), and communication with storage backends (local filesystem, object storage, etc.).
*   **Example:** A path traversal vulnerability in Nextcloud's server-side code allows an attacker to access files outside a user's authorized directory, potentially reaching system files or other users' data.  This is a *server-side* vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* file paths and user-supplied data related to file operations on the server-side.
        *   Use secure coding practices to prevent path traversal, injection vulnerabilities, and other file-related vulnerabilities in the server code.
        *   Regularly audit and test file handling code (server-side), including interactions with external storage providers.
        *   Implement secure handling of symbolic links on the server.
        *   Ensure proper error handling to prevent information leakage from server responses.
        *   Implement and maintain robust server-side encryption mechanisms, including key management.

## Attack Surface: [2. App Ecosystem (Server-Side Aspects)](./attack_surfaces/2__app_ecosystem__server-side_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced by third-party apps installed within Nextcloud, specifically focusing on the *server-side* components of these apps.
    *   **Server Contribution:** Nextcloud's server provides the runtime environment for apps.  Apps can execute server-side code, interact with the database, and access core server functions.  The *server* is responsible for enforcing app permissions (though this can be bypassed by vulnerabilities).
    *   **Example:** A malicious or poorly coded app could contain a server-side SQL injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the Nextcloud database server.  Or, a server-side remote code execution vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, system compromise, denial of service, complete control of the Nextcloud instance (all server-side consequences).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the app and its permissions)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Follow secure coding guidelines when developing apps, paying *critical* attention to server-side code.
            *   Use Nextcloud's provided APIs securely and avoid direct database access where possible.  Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
            *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding on the server-side.
            *   Submit apps for review in the Nextcloud app store.
            *   Provide timely security updates for apps, especially addressing server-side vulnerabilities.
        *   **Server Administrators:**
            *   Implement strict server-side controls to limit the capabilities of apps (e.g., using containerization or other isolation techniques).  This is a *server-level* mitigation.
            *   Monitor server logs for suspicious activity originating from apps.

## Attack Surface: [3. User and Group Management (Server-Side)](./attack_surfaces/3__user_and_group_management__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Nextcloud's *server-side* authentication, authorization, and user/group management features.
    *   **Server Contribution:** Nextcloud's server manages user accounts, groups, permissions, and authentication (including handling interactions with external authentication providers like LDAP on the server-side).  All authentication and authorization logic is executed on the server.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the server-side group management logic could allow a user to gain unauthorized access to files shared with a group they shouldn't belong to.  Or, a bypass of Nextcloud's server-side 2FA implementation.  These are flaws in the *server's* logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, privilege escalation, account takeover (all impacting the server and its data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks *throughout the server-side codebase*.
            *   Use secure session management techniques on the server.
            *   Regularly audit and test user and group management features (server-side), including integrations with external authentication providers.
            *   Ensure proper handling of password resets and account recovery on the server.
            *   Implement secure handling of authentication tokens and secrets on the server.

## Attack Surface: [4. Sharing and Collaboration (Server-Side)](./attack_surfaces/4__sharing_and_collaboration__server-side_.md)

*    **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Nextcloud's *server-side* file sharing and collaborative editing features.
    *    **Server Contribution:** The Nextcloud server manages all aspects of sharing: generating links, enforcing permissions, and handling requests for shared resources.  For collaborative editing, the server interacts with the collaborative editing backend (e.g., Collabora Online or OnlyOffice).
    *    **Example:** A flaw in the server-side link generation or permission checking logic could allow unauthorized access to a shared file. Or, a server-side vulnerability in the integration with a collaborative editing suite could allow an attacker to compromise the Nextcloud server.
    *    **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to shared resources, potential for server compromise (depending on the vulnerability).
    *    **Risk Severity:** High
    *    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *    **Developers:**
            *    Implement robust access control checks on the *server-side* for all sharing mechanisms.
            *    Ensure proper validation and sanitization of user input related to sharing and collaboration on the server.
            *    Regularly audit and test sharing and collaboration features, including the server-side integration with external services.
            *    Securely handle communication between the Nextcloud server and collaborative editing backends.

## Attack Surface: [5. Preview and Thumbnail Generation](./attack_surfaces/5__preview_and_thumbnail_generation.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the *server-side* libraries used by Nextcloud to generate previews and thumbnails of files.
    *   **Server Contribution:** Nextcloud's *server* uses external libraries (e.g., ImageMagick, FFmpeg) to process images, videos, and other file types for preview generation.  This processing happens entirely on the server.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted image file uploaded to the server could exploit a vulnerability in ImageMagick, leading to remote code execution *on the Nextcloud server*.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, denial of service, information leakage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Keep image and video processing libraries (used on the server) updated to the latest versions.
            *   Use secure configurations for these libraries on the server.
            *   Implement sandboxing or other isolation techniques on the server to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in these libraries.
            *   Regularly audit and test preview generation functionality (server-side).
            *   Consider disabling preview generation for certain file types if it's not essential, reducing the server's attack surface.
        * **Server Administrators:**
            *   Ensure that the server environment is configured to limit the privileges of the Nextcloud process, reducing the impact of a successful exploit.
