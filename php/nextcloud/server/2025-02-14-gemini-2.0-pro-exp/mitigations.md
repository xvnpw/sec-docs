# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nextcloud/server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates (Critical)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates__critical_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly update Nextcloud server, apps, and underlying system components.

**Description:**
1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Subscribe to Nextcloud security advisories ([https://nextcloud.com/security/advisories/](https://nextcloud.com/security/advisories/)) and the Nextcloud News section. Check for updates within the Nextcloud admin interface.
2.  **Staging Environment:** Set up a staging environment that mirrors your production environment.
3.  **Backup:** Before *any* update, create a full backup of your Nextcloud data directory, database, and configuration files. Verify the backup's integrity.
4.  **Test in Staging:** Apply the update to the staging environment first. Thoroughly test all functionality, including core features, apps, and integrations.
5.  **Deploy to Production:** If the staging environment tests are successful, apply the update to the production environment. Schedule this during a maintenance window to minimize disruption.
6.  **Post-Update Monitoring:** After the update, monitor the system for any unexpected behavior or errors.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):** Vulnerabilities in Nextcloud or its apps can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** Server-side vulnerabilities can lead to XSS.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi) (High):** Vulnerabilities in the server's database interaction.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Server vulnerabilities can leak sensitive information.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):** Server vulnerabilities can be exploited for DoS.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
*   **SQLi:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).

**Currently Implemented:** [Describe where and how updates are currently managed on the *server*. E.g., "Automated updates enabled for Nextcloud core via cron job, manual updates for apps."]

**Missing Implementation:** [Describe any gaps in the *server-side* update process. E.g., "No staging server," "Backups are not stored off-server."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [App Vetting and Minimization (Server-Side Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/app_vetting_and_minimization__server-side_aspects_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Limit installed apps to those that are essential and thoroughly vet them before installation *from the server's perspective*.

**Description:**
1.  **App Installation Control:**  Use Nextcloud's administrative settings to restrict who can install apps.  Ideally, only designated administrators should have this permission.
2.  **Official App Store Only:** Configure the server to *only* allow app installations from the official Nextcloud app store.  This prevents installation of apps from untrusted sources.
3. **Regular App Audit (Server-Side):** Regularly review the list of installed apps *via the server's admin interface* and remove any that are no longer needed or have questionable security practices.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious Apps (High):** Server-side controls prevent unauthorized installation of malicious apps.
*   **Vulnerable Apps (High):** Minimizing apps reduces the server's attack surface.
*   **Data Exfiltration (High):** Fewer apps mean fewer potential avenues for data exfiltration.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium):** Server-side restrictions limit the potential for app-based privilege escalation.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious Apps:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%) by restricting app installation.
*   **Vulnerable Apps:** Risk reduced significantly (60-70%) by minimizing the number of apps.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced (50-60%).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced (40-50%).

**Currently Implemented:** [Describe server-side app management. E.g., "Only admins can install apps," "App installation is restricted to the official store."]

**Missing Implementation:** [Describe server-side gaps. E.g., "No regular server-side audit of installed apps."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Brute-Force Protection](./mitigation_strategies/brute-force_protection.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and configure Nextcloud's built-in brute-force protection *on the server*.

**Description:**
1.  **Locate Settings:** Find the brute-force protection settings in the Nextcloud admin interface (usually under Security or similar).
2.  **Enable Protection:** Ensure that brute-force protection is enabled *on the server*.
3.  **Configure Thresholds:** Set appropriate thresholds for failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts within 15 minutes).  This is a server-side setting.
4.  **Configure Blocking:** Set the duration for which an IP address should be blocked after exceeding the threshold (e.g., 1 hour). This is also server-side.
5.  **Monitor Logs (Server-Side):** Regularly review Nextcloud's *server logs* for brute-force attempts and blocked IP addresses.
6. **Consider IP Whitelisting (Server-Side, Optional):** If you have a limited set of known IP addresses, configure the *server* to whitelist them.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (High):** Server-side protection limits login attempts.
*   **Credential Stuffing (Medium):** Server-side blocking slows down attackers.

**Impact:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
*   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk reduced moderately (30-40%).

**Currently Implemented:** [Describe the current server-side brute-force protection configuration. E.g., "Enabled with default settings on the server."]

**Missing Implementation:** [Describe server-side gaps. E.g., "Server logs are not monitored for brute-force attempts," "No IP whitelisting configured on the server."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [File Sharing Restrictions (Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/file_sharing_restrictions__server-side_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure file sharing settings *on the server* to minimize the risk of unauthorized data access.

**Description:**
1.  **Disable Public Sharing (Server-Side):** If public sharing is not strictly necessary, disable it entirely *via the server's administrative settings*.
2.  **Limit Public Sharing (Server-Side):** If required, restrict public sharing as much as possible *using server-side controls*.
3.  **Require Passwords (Server-Side):** Enforce password requirements for all publicly shared links *via server settings*.
4.  **Set Expiration Dates (Server-Side):** Enforce expiration dates on shared links *using server-side configuration*.
5.  **Disable Public Uploads (Server-Side):** Prevent anonymous users from uploading files *via server settings*.
6.  **Monitor Sharing Activity (Server-Side):** Regularly review server sharing logs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Leakage (High):** Server-side restrictions prevent unauthorized sharing.
*   **Unauthorized Access (Medium):** Server controls limit access to shared files.
*   **Malware Distribution (Medium):** Server-side restrictions on uploads prevent malware distribution.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced significantly (60-70%).
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced (50-60%).
*   **Malware Distribution:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).

**Missing Implementation:** [Describe server-side gaps. E.g., "No server-side enforcement of expiration dates on shared links."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Headers (Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/security_headers__server-side_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure the *web server* (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to send appropriate security-related HTTP headers.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Web Server:** Determine which web server you are using.
2.  **Configure Headers (Server-Side):** Add the security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, CSP, Referrer-Policy) to your *web server's* configuration files (as described in the previous, more detailed response).  This is entirely a server-side task.
3.  **Test Configuration (Server-Side):** Use online tools to test your *web server's* security headers.
4. **Update `config.php`:** Ensure server related settings are correct.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium):** Server-sent headers (CSP, X-XSS-Protection) mitigate XSS.
*   **Clickjacking (Medium):** Server-sent X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking.
*   **MIME-Sniffing Attacks (Low):** Server-sent X-Content-Type-Options prevents MIME-sniffing.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Low):** Server-sent HSTS enforces HTTPS.

**Impact:**

**Missing Implementation:** [Describe server-side gaps. E.g., "CSP is not configured on the web server," "X-Frame-Options is missing from the web server configuration."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging (Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging__server-side_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and regularly review Nextcloud's audit logs *on the server*.

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Logging (Server-Side):** Ensure that audit logging is enabled in Nextcloud's *server* settings.
2.  **Configure Log Level (Server-Side):** Set an appropriate log level on the *server*.
3.  **Log Rotation (Server-Side):** Configure log rotation on the *server* to prevent logs from growing too large.
4.  **Regular Review (Server-Side):** Regularly review the audit logs *stored on the server*.
5.  **SIEM Integration (Optional, Server-Side):** Consider integrating Nextcloud's *server* logs with a SIEM system.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Insider Threats (Medium):** Server logs help detect malicious user actions.
*   **Compromised Accounts (Medium):** Server logs can reveal unusual activity.
*   **Data Breaches (Low):** Server logs provide information for incident response.

**Impact:**
*   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduced moderately (30-40%).
*   **Compromised Accounts:** Risk reduced moderately (30-40%).
*   **Data Breaches:** Provides information, but doesn't directly prevent.

**Currently Implemented:** [Describe the current server-side audit logging configuration. E.g., "Audit logging is enabled on the server."]

**Missing Implementation:** [Describe server-side gaps. E.g., "Server logs are not reviewed regularly," "No SIEM integration for server logs."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [`config.php` Secure Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/_config_php__secure_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Ensure the `config.php` file, which resides on the server, is securely configured.

**Description:**
1. **Access `config.php`:** Locate the `config.php` file within your Nextcloud installation directory on the server.
2. **Review and Modify:** Carefully review the following settings and adjust as needed:
    *   `trusted_domains`:  Ensure this array *only* contains the valid domain names used to access your Nextcloud instance.  This prevents host header injection attacks.
    *   `overwriteprotocol`:  If you are using HTTPS (which you should be), set this to `'https'`.
    *   `datadirectory`: Ensure this points to a secure location *outside* of the web root.
    *   `dbtype`, `dbhost`, `dbname`, `dbuser`, `dbpassword`:  Use strong, unique credentials for your database connection.
    *   `loglevel`: Set an appropriate log level (e.g., `2` for warnings and errors).
    *   `maintenance`:  Use this setting (`true`/`false`) to put the server into maintenance mode during updates or other administrative tasks.
    *   `session_lifetime`: Configure an appropriate session timeout.
    *   `session_keepalive`:  Consider disabling this if not needed.
3. **File Permissions:** Ensure that the `config.php` file has restrictive file permissions (e.g., `640` or `600` on Linux/Unix systems) to prevent unauthorized access.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Host Header Injection (High):** Incorrect `trusted_domains` can allow attackers to spoof the server's hostname.
* **Unauthorized Access (High):** Weak database credentials or insecure file permissions can lead to unauthorized access.
* **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Incorrect `loglevel` can reveal sensitive information in logs.
* **Session Hijacking (Medium):** Long session lifetimes increase the risk of session hijacking.

**Impact:**
* **Host Header Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (90-95%) with correct `trusted_domains`.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%) with strong credentials and file permissions.
* **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (50-60%) with appropriate `loglevel`.
* **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced (30-40%) with appropriate session settings.

**Currently Implemented:** [Describe the current state of `config.php` security. E.g., "`trusted_domains` is correctly configured," "Database credentials are strong."]

**Missing Implementation:** [Describe any gaps. E.g., "`config.php` file permissions are too permissive," "`loglevel` is set to debug."]
