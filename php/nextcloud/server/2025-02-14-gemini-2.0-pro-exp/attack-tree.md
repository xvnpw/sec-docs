## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core Server Code](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_core_server_code.md)

*   **RCE (Remote Code Execution) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **-> HIGH RISK -> Unpatched known vulnerability:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting a publicly known and documented vulnerability in the Nextcloud server code for which a patch is available but has not been applied.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if patching is not diligent).
        *   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise).
        *   **Effort:** Medium (exploit code may be publicly available).
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise 3rd-Party Apps/Integrations](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_3rd-party_appsintegrations.md)

*   **RCE (Remote Code Execution) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **-> HIGH RISK -> App-specific RCE:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting a vulnerability within a third-party Nextcloud app to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on app security and popularity).
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (potential for full system compromise).
        *   **Effort:** Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Abuse Server Configuration/Features](./attack_tree_paths/3__abuse_server_configurationfeatures.md)

*   **Misconfigured Sharing**
    *   **-> HIGH RISK -> Overly permissive sharing settings:**
        *   **Description:**  Users or administrators configuring file shares with overly broad permissions (e.g., public shares with write access), allowing unauthorized access or modification of data.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (due to user error or lack of awareness).
        *   **Impact:** Low to High (depends on the sensitivity of the shared data).
        *   **Effort:** Very Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium.

*   **Weak/Default Credentials**
    *   **-> HIGH RISK -> Easily guessable passwords:**
        *   **Description:**  Using weak, easily guessable, or default passwords for user or administrator accounts.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (common security lapse).
        *   **Impact:** Very High (complete account compromise, potential for full system compromise).
        *   **Effort:** Very Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (through failed login attempt monitoring).
    * **Default admin/user password [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Using default administrative or user passwords that come with the software.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.
        *   **Impact:** Very High.
        *   **Effort:** Very Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy.
    * **-> HIGH RISK-> No 2FA enabled:**
        * **Description:** Not enabling Two-Factor Authentication, which significantly increases the risk of account compromise if credentials are stolen or guessed.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on administrative policy).
        * **Impact:** High (amplifies the impact of credential compromise).
        * **Effort:** N/A (vulnerability, not an attack step).
        * **Skill Level:** N/A.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** N/A.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Physical Access to Server](./attack_tree_paths/4__physical_access_to_server.md)

*   **Direct Access to Server Hardware [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Gaining physical access to the server hardware, allowing bypassing of software-level security controls.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low to Low (depends on physical security).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard.
