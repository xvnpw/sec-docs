## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Nextcloud Application via Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_nextcloud_application_via_server_vulnerabilities.md)

This is the overarching goal. It represents the attacker's intention to exploit weaknesses within the Nextcloud server to compromise the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_software_vulnerabilities.md)

This is a primary attack vector focusing on flaws in the Nextcloud codebase, its apps, or dependencies.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Nextcloud core, apps, or third-party libraries.
    *   Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities (undisclosed vulnerabilities) discovered by the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

This path involves leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) that affect Nextcloud.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Nextcloud server. This is the most critical type of vulnerability.
        *   Examples: Deserialization vulnerabilities, insecure file handling, command injection flaws.
        *   Exploitation Methods: Crafted HTTP requests, malicious file uploads, exploiting vulnerabilities in specific apps or APIs.
    *   **Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting flaws in the authentication mechanisms to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access without valid credentials.
        *   Examples: Logic flaws in login routines, session token manipulation vulnerabilities, API authentication bypasses.
        *   Exploitation Methods: Manipulating session tokens, exploiting flawed authentication logic in API endpoints or login forms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerabilities.md)

RCE vulnerabilities are the most severe as they allow attackers to gain complete control over the server.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Identifying RCE vulnerabilities in Nextcloud core, installed apps, or underlying dependencies.
    *   Exploiting identified RCE vulnerabilities through various methods.
*   Exploitation Methods:
    *   Crafting malicious HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   Uploading malicious files that exploit file processing vulnerabilities.
    *   Leveraging vulnerabilities in specific apps or APIs to execute code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

Authentication bypass allows direct unauthorized access to the Nextcloud instance.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Identifying vulnerabilities in Nextcloud's login logic or API authentication mechanisms.
    *   Exploiting these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication.
*   Exploitation Methods:
    *   Manipulating session tokens or cookies to gain authenticated access.
    *   Exploiting flaws in the authentication logic of login forms or API endpoints.
    *   Leveraging vulnerabilities in third-party authentication integrations (if used).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations.md)

Misconfigurations in the Nextcloud server setup can create significant security weaknesses.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Exploiting weak or default credentials for administrator or user accounts.
    *   Exploiting other misconfigurations (less high-risk, thus not included in this sub-tree, but still important in full threat model).

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

Using easily guessable or default passwords is a fundamental security flaw.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Identifying default administrator or user credentials that were not changed after installation.
    *   Identifying weak passwords used by administrators or users.
    *   Exploiting these weak credentials to gain unauthorized access.
*   Exploitation Methods:
    *   Brute-force attacks against login pages.
    *   Dictionary attacks using lists of common passwords.
    *   Credential stuffing using leaked credentials from other breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering (Targeting Admins/Users - Indirect Server Vulnerability, but Relevant)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering__targeting_adminsusers_-_indirect_server_vulnerability__but_relevant_.md)

While not directly exploiting server software vulnerabilities, social engineering attacks targeting users or administrators can lead to account compromise and application access.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Phishing attacks to steal credentials.
    *   Credential stuffing/brute-force attacks against user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_attacks.md)

Phishing is a common and effective social engineering technique to steal credentials.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Conducting phishing campaigns targeting Nextcloud administrators or users.
    *   Tricking users into revealing their login credentials or session tokens.
*   Exploitation Methods:
    *   Creating fake login pages that mimic the Nextcloud login interface.
    *   Sending emails or messages with malicious links that lead to fake login pages.
    *   Impersonating legitimate entities to trick users into providing credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Stuffing/Brute Force Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/credential_stuffingbrute_force_attacks.md)

These attacks attempt to guess user passwords through automated methods.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Conducting credential stuffing attacks using lists of leaked credentials.
    *   Conducting brute-force attacks to guess passwords through repeated login attempts.
*   Exploitation Methods:
    *   Using automated tools to try large lists of usernames and passwords against the Nextcloud login page or API endpoints.
    *   Leveraging leaked credential databases to attempt login with previously compromised credentials.
