*   **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific input string that, when processed by the `Inflector`'s regular expressions (used for pluralization, singularization, etc.), causes excessive backtracking and consumes significant CPU resources. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, denial of service for legitimate users, potential server instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** The regular expression engine used internally by various `Inflector` methods like `pluralize`, `singularize`, `camelize`, etc.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and test the regular expressions used within the `Inflector` library (though direct modification is generally discouraged; focus on understanding their potential weaknesses).
        *   Consider setting timeouts for string processing operations if feasible to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   Monitor application performance for unusual CPU spikes when using `Inflector`.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack / Compromised Dependency
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `doctrine/inflector` library itself, either by injecting malicious code into the repository or through a compromised distribution channel. If the application uses a compromised version of the library, the attacker's code will be executed within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data breaches, malware distribution, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `doctrine/inflector` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency management tools (e.g., Composer) to manage and track dependencies.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `doctrine/inflector`.
        *   Consider using tools that perform static analysis or security scanning of dependencies.
        *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded library (e.g., using checksums or signatures).
