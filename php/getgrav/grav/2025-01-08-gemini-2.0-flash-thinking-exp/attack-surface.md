# Attack Surface Analysis for getgrav/grav

## Attack Surface: [Twig Templating Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/twig_templating_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Improperly sanitized data passed to Twig templates can lead to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**How Grav Contributes:** Grav uses Twig as its primary templating engine, making any vulnerabilities in Twig or its improper usage a direct attack vector. Developers might unknowingly pass unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources directly into Twig templates.

**Example:** A plugin displays a user-provided message using `{{ message }}` in a Twig template without escaping. An attacker could input `{{ _self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback("system") }}{{ _self.env.getFilter("id") }}` to execute the `id` command on the server.

**Impact:** Critical. Full server compromise, data breaches, and complete control over the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Always sanitize user input and encode output within Twig templates using appropriate filters (e.g., `escape` or `e`).
*   **Avoid Dynamic Template Generation with User Input:**  Minimize the use of user input to dynamically construct template paths or include files.
*   **Regularly Update Twig:** Keep the Twig library updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Consider a Security Review of Custom Templates:**  For complex applications, a security review of custom Twig templates is recommended.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Plugins extend Grav's functionality, and poorly coded plugins can introduce various security flaws like XSS, SQL Injection (if the plugin uses a database), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or authentication bypasses.

**How Grav Contributes:** Grav's plugin architecture allows third-party code with varying security levels to be integrated. The core Grav system relies on the security of its ecosystem of plugins.

**Example:** A contact form plugin doesn't properly sanitize user input in the "subject" field before storing it in a file or database. This could be exploited for XSS. Another example is a backup plugin with a vulnerability allowing unauthorized file downloads, leading to information disclosure. A vulnerable plugin handling file uploads could allow for Remote Code Execution.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability. Can range from medium (XSS) to critical (RCE, data breaches).

**Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for critical vulnerabilities in plugins)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Install Plugins from Trusted Sources:** Only install plugins from the official Grav repository or reputable developers.
*   **Regularly Update Plugins:** Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Review Plugin Code (if possible):** For sensitive applications, consider reviewing the source code of plugins before installation.
*   **Disable Unused Plugins:** Remove any plugins that are not actively being used to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Implement a Plugin Security Policy:** Establish guidelines for plugin usage and security within the development team.

## Attack Surface: [Media Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/media_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Improper validation or sanitization of uploaded media files (images, documents, etc.) can allow attackers to upload malicious files that could be executed on the server or used for phishing attacks.

**How Grav Contributes:** Grav allows users to upload media files, and the security of this process depends on how Grav and its plugins handle these uploads.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP file disguised as an image. If the web server is misconfigured or Grav doesn't properly restrict access, this file could be executed, leading to RCE.

**Impact:** Can range from medium (serving malicious content) to critical (RCE).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict File Type Validation:** Implement robust file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension.
*   **Sanitize Uploaded Files:**  Process uploaded files (e.g., image resizing, stripping metadata) to remove potential malicious content.
*   **Restrict Access to Uploaded Files:** Configure the web server to prevent direct execution of uploaded files. Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible.
*   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Can help mitigate the impact of uploaded malicious HTML files.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Grav's admin panel authentication (login process) or authorization (access control) can allow unauthorized users to gain administrative access.

**How Grav Contributes:** Grav provides a built-in admin panel, and the security of this panel is crucial for the overall security of the site. Weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms directly expose the system.

**Example:** A brute-force attack against weak admin panel passwords. A vulnerability in a custom admin plugin that bypasses authentication checks.

**Impact:** Critical. Full control over the website, including content manipulation, user management, and potentially server access.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Implement password complexity requirements and encourage the use of strong, unique passwords.
*   **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Add an extra layer of security to the admin login process.
*   **Limit Login Attempts:** Implement measures to prevent brute-force attacks by locking accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
*   **Keep Grav Core Updated:** Ensure the core Grav system is updated to patch any known authentication vulnerabilities.
*   **Restrict Admin Panel Access:** Limit access to the admin panel based on IP address or other network restrictions if feasible.
