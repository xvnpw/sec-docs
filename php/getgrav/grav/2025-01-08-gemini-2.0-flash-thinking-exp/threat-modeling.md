# Threat Model Analysis for getgrav/grav

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Routing](./threats/path_traversal_via_routing.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate URL parameters or crafted requests to bypass Grav's routing mechanism and access files outside the intended content directory. This might involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how Grav handles file paths or includes.

**Impact:** Sensitive configuration files (e.g., `user/config/system.yaml`), system files, or other user data could be exposed. In some cases, it might lead to remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Grav's Router component, potentially in conjunction with file handling functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all URL parameters and file paths handled by Grav.
*   Regularly update Grav core to patch any identified routing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with administrative access (or by compromising an admin account) could install a malicious plugin designed to execute arbitrary code, steal data, or compromise the server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Grav website and potentially the underlying server. This could lead to data breaches, defacement, denial of service, or further attacks on other systems.

**Affected Component:** Grav's Plugin Manager, the plugin installation process.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Strictly control access to the Grav admin panel and enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
*   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
*   Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or have known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement security scanning tools to detect potentially malicious code in plugins.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit known security vulnerabilities in installed third-party plugins. This could involve sending specifically crafted requests or data to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the plugin, but it could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Specific third-party plugins with vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update all installed plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for the plugins you use.
*   Consider using plugins with a good security track record and active maintenance.
*   If a plugin is no longer maintained or has known unpatched vulnerabilities, consider replacing it with a secure alternative or removing it.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig Templates](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_twig_templates.md)

**Description:** If user-supplied data is directly embedded into Twig templates without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious Twig code that is executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This could lead to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Grav's Twig templating engine, specifically when rendering templates with unsanitized user input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid directly embedding user input into Twig templates.
*   Use Twig's built-in escaping mechanisms to sanitize user input before rendering it in templates.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/unrestricted_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** If Grav or a plugin allows users to upload files without proper validation of file types and content, an attacker could upload malicious executable files (e.g., PHP scripts).

**Impact:** Remote code execution. Once the malicious file is uploaded, the attacker can access it through the web server and execute the code, potentially gaining full control of the server.

**Affected Component:** Grav's media handling features, plugin upload functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict file type validation on all file uploads, allowing only necessary and safe file types.
*   Sanitize filenames to prevent directory traversal attempts.
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a directory with restricted execution permissions.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attack on Admin Panel](./threats/brute-force_attack_on_admin_panel.md)

**Description:** Attackers could attempt to guess the administrator's username and password by repeatedly trying different combinations.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Grav admin panel, allowing the attacker to perform any administrative action, including installing malicious plugins, modifying content, and potentially gaining control of the server.

**Affected Component:** Grav's Admin Panel login functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts.
*   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
*   Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Publicly Accessible Configuration Files](./threats/information_disclosure_through_publicly_accessible_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** If Grav's routing or plugin mechanisms fail to properly restrict access, sensitive Grav configuration files (e.g., `user/config/system.yaml`) might be accessible directly through the web browser.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or other configuration details, which could be used for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Grav's Router, plugin file serving mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure Grav's core and plugins properly restrict access to sensitive files.
*   Regularly update Grav to patch any identified vulnerabilities related to file access.
