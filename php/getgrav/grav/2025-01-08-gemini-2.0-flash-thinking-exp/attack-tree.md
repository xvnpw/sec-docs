## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Grav Core Vulnerabilities -> Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Core [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_grav_core_vulnerabilities_-_achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__in_core__crit_cc9e8e85.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Unsafe Deserialization:**
        * An attacker crafts malicious serialized data.
        * This data is injected into a process within the Grav core that deserializes data without proper validation.
        * Upon deserialization, the malicious code within the data is executed, granting the attacker remote code execution on the server.
    * **Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Inject malicious code via Markdown parsing:**
            * An attacker crafts malicious Markdown content.
            * This content exploits vulnerabilities in Grav's Markdown parsing library.
            * When the malicious Markdown is processed, it leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.
        * **Inject malicious code via Twig templating engine:**
            * An attacker injects malicious code into data that is processed by Grav's Twig templating engine.
            * This could occur through user input or by manipulating data sources.
            * When the Twig template is rendered, the injected code is executed on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities -> Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Plugin/Theme [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_plugintheme_vulnerabilities_-_achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__in_pluginth_b91f7f73.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Unsafe Deserialization in Plugin/Theme:**
        * Similar to the core vulnerability, but the unsafe deserialization occurs within a specific plugin or theme.
        * An attacker crafts malicious serialized data targeting the plugin or theme's deserialization process.
        * Successful exploitation grants the attacker code execution within the context of the plugin/theme, which can often lead to broader server compromise.
    * **Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Plugin/Theme:**
        * **Inject malicious code via plugin-specific input fields:**
            * Many plugins accept user input through forms or other mechanisms.
            * An attacker injects malicious code into these input fields, exploiting a lack of proper sanitization or validation within the plugin's code.
            * When the plugin processes this input, the malicious code is executed.
        * **Inject malicious code via theme-specific template rendering:**
            * Themes often handle dynamic content and may use templating engines similar to Twig.
            * An attacker can inject malicious code into data processed by the theme's templating engine, leading to code execution during page rendering.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise Admin Panel [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_admin_panel__critical_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Brute-Force Admin Credentials:**
        * An attacker attempts to guess the administrator's username and password by trying numerous combinations.
        * This is often automated using specialized tools.
        * Success depends on the complexity of the password and whether the application has implemented effective rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
    * **Credential Stuffing:**
        * An attacker uses lists of compromised usernames and passwords obtained from other data breaches.
        * They attempt to log in to the Grav admin panel using these credentials, hoping that the administrator has reused the same credentials across multiple services.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Admin Panel Authentication:**
        * **Bypass authentication mechanisms:**
            * An attacker exploits flaws in the admin panel's authentication logic.
            * This could involve manipulating requests, exploiting logical errors in the code, or bypassing security checks to gain access without valid credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit File System Access Vulnerabilities -> Directly Access Configuration Files [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_file_system_access_vulnerabilities_-_directly_access_configuration_files__cri_9c98e260.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Directly Access Configuration Files:**
        * This attack relies on misconfigurations or vulnerabilities at the server level, rather than within the Grav application itself.
        * Examples include:
            * **Directory Traversal:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the web server configuration or application code to access files outside of the intended webroot.
            * **Insecure File Permissions:**  Configuration files have overly permissive access rights, allowing unauthorized users to read them.
            * **Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in server-side include directives to read file contents.
        * Successful access to configuration files can reveal sensitive information such as administrator credentials, API keys, and database connection details (though Grav is flat-file, it might store other sensitive keys).
