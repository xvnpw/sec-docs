# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for getgrav/grav

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Plugin/Theme Selection and Management](./mitigation_strategies/careful_plugintheme_selection_and_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous selection, updating, and removal of unused plugins and themes.  This is *the* most important Grav-specific mitigation.

**Description:**
1.  **Selection:** Before installing *any* plugin or theme:
    *   Check its source. Prefer the official Grav repository or well-known, reputable developers.
    *   Examine the "Last Updated" date.  Avoid plugins/themes that haven't been updated in a long time (e.g., over a year).
    *   Read reviews and community feedback. Look for reports of security issues or instability.
    *   If possible, briefly review the plugin/theme's code. Look for red flags like direct database queries, `eval()`, or insecure file handling.
2.  **Updating:**
    *   Enable automatic update checks in Grav's admin panel.
    *   *Immediately* update Grav core, plugins, and themes after any new release.  Do not delay updates.  Use Grav's built-in update mechanism.
    *   Subscribe to the Grav newsletter and any relevant plugin/theme developer newsletters or forums to receive security alerts.
3.  **Removal:**
    *   Identify any plugins or themes that are not actively used.
    *   Completely *remove* them from the `user/plugins` and `user/themes` directories.  Disabling is not sufficient.  Use Grav's admin panel or manually delete the directories.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin/Theme Vulnerability (Severity: Critical):**  A vulnerable plugin or theme could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Plugin/Theme Vulnerability (Severity: High):**  A vulnerable plugin or theme could inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Privilege Escalation via Plugin/Theme Vulnerability (Severity: High):**  A vulnerable plugin could allow unauthorized access to the Grav admin panel.
*   **Information Disclosure via Plugin/Theme Vulnerability (Severity: Medium):**  A vulnerable plugin or theme could leak sensitive information.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:**  Risk significantly reduced.
*   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example: Partially - We update regularly, but haven't thoroughly reviewed all plugin code.)*  **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example: We need to implement a more formal process for reviewing plugin code before installation.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Grav Configuration and Feature Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_grav_configuration_and_feature_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Properly configure Grav settings within the admin panel and YAML files, and disable unnecessary features.

**Description:**
1.  **Configuration Review (Admin Panel & YAML):**
    *   Use the Grav admin panel to review and configure settings.
    *   Carefully review all YAML files in `user/config`, especially `system.yaml` and `security.yaml`.
    *   Ensure `security.yaml` has a strong, randomly generated `salt`.  This is set during installation but should be verified.
    *   Set `system.yaml` -> `debugger: enabled: false` in production.  This is a *critical* Grav-specific setting.
    *   Review and configure `uploads_dangerous_extensions` in `security.yaml`. This is Grav's built-in (but basic) file upload restriction.
2.  **Feature Disablement (Admin Panel):**
    *   Use the Grav admin panel to disable any Grav features (e.g., specific caching methods, unused plugins) that are not essential.
3. **Admin Path Change:**
     * Change the default admin path from `/admin` to a less predictable path in `system.yaml` (e.g., `/my-secret-admin`). This is a Grav-specific configuration change.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure via Configuration Files (Severity: High):**  Incorrect settings could expose sensitive information.
*   **Privilege Escalation via Debugger (Severity: High):**  The debugger, if enabled in production, can expose sensitive information and allow attackers to gain control.
*   **Various Attacks via Misconfiguration (Severity: Variable):**  Incorrect configuration settings can create various vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced by ensuring correct settings.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk eliminated by disabling the debugger in production.
*   **Various Attacks:** Risk reduced by ensuring correct configuration and disabling unnecessary features.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example: We have disabled the debugger, but haven't changed the default admin path.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example: We need to change the default admin path and document our configuration review process.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict File Upload Handling (Using Grav's Features)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_file_upload_handling__using_grav's_features_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Utilize Grav's built-in file upload restrictions and, if developing custom plugins, implement robust validation.

**Description:**
1.  **`uploads_dangerous_extensions`:**
    *   Use Grav's `uploads_dangerous_extensions` setting in `security.yaml` to define a list of disallowed file extensions.  This is a *baseline* and should be as restrictive as possible.
2.  **Custom Plugin Validation (If Applicable):**
    *   If you are developing a custom plugin that handles file uploads, you *must* implement robust server-side validation *within the plugin's PHP code*.  This is *not* handled automatically by Grav.
    *   Check:
        *   **Content Type (MIME Type):**  Use PHP's `finfo_file()` or a similar reliable method.
        *   **File Extension:**  Compare against a *whitelist* of allowed extensions.
        *   **Magic Numbers (File Signatures):**  Check the file's header bytes.
    *   Reject any file that doesn't match *all* criteria.
    *   Rename uploaded files to randomly generated names *within your plugin's code*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious File Upload (Severity: Critical):**  Attackers could upload a PHP shell.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious File Upload (Severity: High):**  Attackers could upload an HTML file with malicious JavaScript.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Risk reduced by using `uploads_dangerous_extensions` and significantly reduced by implementing robust validation in custom plugins.
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced similarly to RCE.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example: We use `uploads_dangerous_extensions`, but have a custom plugin that needs review.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example: We need to thoroughly review and update the file upload handling in our custom plugin.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Preventing File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (Within Grav and Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/preventing_file_inclusion_vulnerabilities__within_grav_and_plugins_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Avoid dynamic file inclusion based on user input within Twig templates and plugin code.  Whitelist allowed files if necessary.

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid Dynamic Inclusion (Twig & PHP):**
    *   Do *not* use user-supplied data directly in Twig's `include` statements or PHP's `include`/`require`. This applies to both core Grav templates and any custom plugins you develop.
    *   Example of *bad* code (Twig):  `{% include page_name ~ '.html.twig' %}` (where `page_name` comes from user input)
    *   Example of *bad* code (PHP - within a plugin):  `include($_GET['page'] . '.php');`
2.  **Whitelisting (If Necessary):**
    *   If dynamic inclusion is *absolutely necessary* (rarely the case), create a whitelist of allowed file paths *within your PHP code (plugin or page logic)*.
        ```php
        $allowed_pages = [
            'home' => 'templates/home.html.twig',
            'about' => 'templates/about.html.twig',
        ];
        $page = $_GET['page'];
        if (isset($allowed_pages[$page])) {
            include($allowed_pages[$page]); // Safe
        }
        ```
3.  **Sanitization (Within Plugin Code):**
    *   If user input *must* be used to construct a file path (again, avoid this if possible), sanitize it thoroughly *within your PHP code*:
        *   Use `basename()` and `realpath()`.
        *   Remove malicious characters.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) (Severity: High):**  Attackers could include local files.
*   **Direct File Inclusion (DFI) (Severity: High):** Similar to LFI.

**Impact:**
*   **LFI/DFI:** Risk significantly reduced by avoiding dynamic inclusion and using whitelisting/sanitization where absolutely necessary.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example: We avoid dynamic inclusion in Twig, but need to audit all plugin code.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example: We need to conduct a thorough code review of all plugins to identify and fix any instances of dynamic inclusion.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection (Using Grav's Form Plugin)](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection__using_grav's_form_plugin_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Grav's built-in `form.nonce` system for all forms, both in standard templates and custom plugins.

**Description:**
1.  **Twig Template:**
    *   Include `{{ form.nonce }}` within *every* form in your Twig templates. This is a Grav-provided function.
        ```twig
        <form method="post" action="...">
            {{ form.nonce }}
            <input type="text" name="my_field">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        ```
2.  **Form Processing (Plugin or Page):**
    *   In your PHP code (within a plugin or a page's event handlers), validate the nonce using Grav's `form` object:
        ```php
        if ($form->validateNonce()) {
            // Process the form data
        } else {
            // Handle invalid nonce
        }
        ```
    *   This is typically done within a plugin's `onFormProcessed` event or a page's `onPageContentProcessed` event.
3. **Plugin Development:**
    * If you are creating custom plugins with forms, *always* follow steps 1 and 2. Use Grav's built-in nonce system.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Severity: High):**  Attackers could trick users into submitting unintended actions.

**Impact:**
*   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced by using Grav's built-in nonce system correctly.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example: We use `form.nonce` in most forms, but need to verify all forms, especially in older parts of the site.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example: We need to audit all forms to ensure `form.nonce` is present and validated.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Caching (Using Grav's Built-in System)](./mitigation_strategies/caching__using_grav's_built-in_system_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Utilize and properly configure Grav's built-in caching mechanisms.

**Description:**
1.  **Configuration (Admin Panel):**
    *   Use the Grav admin panel to configure caching settings.  This is entirely within Grav's control.
    *   Choose appropriate caching levels (e.g., page caching, Twig caching) based on your content and traffic.
    *   Set appropriate cache lifetimes.
2. **Cache Clearing:**
    * Regularly clear the cache (using the admin panel) when content is updated.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Caching can reduce the load on the server, mitigating some DoS attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced by caching, improving performance and resilience.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example: We have basic caching enabled.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example: We need to review and optimize our caching configuration for better performance.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [YAML Parsing Vulnerabilities (Reliance on Grav Updates)](./mitigation_strategies/yaml_parsing_vulnerabilities__reliance_on_grav_updates_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Grav updated. This relies entirely on the Grav team addressing any vulnerabilities in the underlying Symfony YAML component.

**Description:**
1. **Keep Grav Updated:**
    * This is the *primary* mitigation. Follow the update procedures outlined in Mitigation Strategy #1, using Grav's built-in update mechanism.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via YAML Parser Vulnerability (Severity: Critical, but *very* unlikely):** A vulnerability in the YAML parser.

**Impact:**
* **RCE:** Risk is extremely low if Grav is kept updated.

**Currently Implemented:** *(Example: We keep Grav updated.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

**Missing Implementation:** *(Example: None, as long as we maintain our update schedule.)* **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**
