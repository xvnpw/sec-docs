Okay, let's create a design document for the Grav CMS project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Grav is a flat-file content management system (CMS).  It's designed to be fast, simple, and flexible, appealing to users who want a lightweight alternative to database-driven CMSs like WordPress or Drupal.  The business priorities likely revolve around:

*   Ease of Use:  Attracting users with a simple installation and management process.
*   Performance:  Providing a fast website experience, leveraging its flat-file architecture.
*   Extensibility:  Allowing users to customize and extend functionality through plugins and themes.
*   Community:  Fostering a strong community for support, development, and contribution.
*   Reputation: Maintaining a reputation for being secure, reliable, and well-maintained.

Based on these priorities, the most important business risks are:

*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Exploitable vulnerabilities in the core CMS, plugins, or themes could lead to website defacement, data breaches, or complete site takeover. This is a critical risk given the public-facing nature of websites.
*   Performance Degradation:  Poorly written plugins, themes, or excessive content could negatively impact website performance, driving users away.
*   Lack of Adoption:  If Grav fails to attract and retain users, its long-term viability is threatened.
*   Reputational Damage:  Security incidents or negative user experiences could damage Grav's reputation, hindering adoption and community growth.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of third-party libraries or build processes could introduce vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Grav, being a self-hosted CMS, has a security posture that heavily relies on the user's implementation and the inherent security of the platform itself.

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of flat-file CMSs):

*   security control: Input Validation: Grav likely employs input validation to sanitize user-provided data before processing or storing it, mitigating risks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and code injection. Implemented in core code and recommended for plugin/theme developers.
*   security control: Configuration Hardening: Grav provides configuration options to enhance security, such as disabling unnecessary features or restricting access to sensitive files. Described in documentation and configuration files.
*   security control: Regular Updates: The Grav team releases updates to address security vulnerabilities and improve functionality.  This relies on users actively updating their installations. Described in release notes and update mechanisms.
*   security control: Plugin/Theme Vetting (Limited): While there's a plugin/theme ecosystem, the level of vetting before inclusion may vary.  Users should exercise caution when installing third-party extensions. Described in plugin/theme repository guidelines.
*   security control: File Permissions: Proper file permissions on the server are crucial for preventing unauthorized access. This is primarily the responsibility of the user during installation and maintenance. Described in installation documentation.
*   security control: .htaccess (Apache): Grav utilizes .htaccess files (on Apache servers) to configure security settings like directory listing prevention and access control. Described in default .htaccess files.
*   security control: YAML Configuration: Uses YAML files for configuration, which are less prone to injection vulnerabilities compared to executable configuration files. Implemented in core code.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: User Responsibility: A significant portion of the security responsibility rests with the user, including server configuration, plugin/theme selection, and regular updates.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Plugin/Theme Risk: While the core Grav system might be secure, vulnerabilities in third-party plugins or themes can compromise the entire site.
*   accepted risk: Limited Built-in Protections: Compared to some enterprise-grade CMSs, Grav may have fewer built-in security features like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs).

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Security Audits: Regular security audits (both manual code review and automated scanning) of the core Grav code and popular plugins/themes.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing CSP headers to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks.
*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Offering 2FA for administrative accounts to enhance login security.
*   security control: Security Headers: Enforcing the use of security-related HTTP headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).
*   security control: Automated Security Scanning: Integrating automated security scanning tools into the development and release process.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Secure password storage using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks (e.g., rate limiting, account lockout).
    *   Optional support for multi-factor authentication.
*   Authorization:
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
    *   Clear separation of privileges between different user roles (e.g., administrator, editor, contributor).
    *   Secure handling of user sessions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user-provided input, including form data, URL parameters, and file uploads.
    *   Whitelist-based validation where possible, rather than blacklist-based.
    *   Output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys).
    *   Secure generation and management of cryptographic keys.
    *   Avoidance of deprecated or weak cryptographic algorithms.

## BUILD

Grav's build process is relatively simple, as it's primarily a collection of PHP files and doesn't require compilation in the traditional sense. However, there are still build-related aspects to consider, particularly for releases and development.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Developer Workstation]
    B[GitHub Repository]
    C[GitHub Actions]
    D[Release Artifacts]
    E[Composer]
    A -- "Commits code" --> B
    B -- "Triggers build" --> C
    C -- "Runs tests" --> C
    C -- "Runs linters" --> C
    C -- "Manages dependencies" --> E
    C -- "Creates release" --> D
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Development: Developers work on the Grav core, plugins, and themes locally.
2.  Version Control: Code is managed using Git and hosted on GitHub.
3.  Dependency Management: Composer is used to manage PHP dependencies.
4.  Automated Builds (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions is used to automate tasks like:
    *   Running unit tests.
    *   Running code linters (e.g., PHP_CodeSniffer).
    *   Managing dependencies with Composer.
    *   Creating release artifacts (zip files).
5.  Release: When a new version is tagged, GitHub Actions creates a release artifact (a zip file containing the Grav files) and publishes it on GitHub.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code Review: Pull requests are used to review code changes before merging them into the main branch.
*   security control: Automated Testing: Unit tests help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Code Linting: Linters enforce coding standards and help identify potential security issues.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Composer helps manage dependencies and ensures that known vulnerable versions are not used (with proper configuration and updates).
*   security control: GitHub Actions Security: Using a secure CI/CD environment like GitHub Actions, with appropriate permissions and secrets management.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Website Availability: Ensuring the website is accessible to users.
*   Content Management: Allowing authorized users to create, edit, and publish content.
*   User Authentication: Securely authenticating users and managing their access.
*   Plugin/Theme Management: Allowing users to extend functionality through plugins and themes.

Data to Protect:

*   Website Content (Low to Medium Sensitivity): The actual content of the website, which may include text, images, and other media. The sensitivity depends on the nature of the website.
*   User Data (Medium to High Sensitivity): Usernames, hashed passwords, email addresses, and potentially other personal information.
*   Configuration Data (Medium Sensitivity): Configuration files containing settings, API keys, and potentially other sensitive information.
*   System Files (High Sensitivity): Core Grav files, plugin files, and theme files.  Compromise of these files could lead to complete site takeover.
