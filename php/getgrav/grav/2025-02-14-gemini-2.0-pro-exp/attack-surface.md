# Attack Surface Analysis for getgrav/grav

## Attack Surface: [Direct File System Access](./attack_surfaces/direct_file_system_access.md)

*   **1. Direct File System Access**

    *   **Description:** Unauthorized access to, or modification of, files within the Grav installation directory.
    *   **How Grav Contributes:** Grav's core design is *entirely* file-based.  All content, configuration, plugins, and core code reside in the file system, making it the *primary* and most critical attack vector.  There is no database abstraction layer to mitigate this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access (via compromised credentials, a plugin vulnerability, or server misconfiguration) and modifies core PHP files to inject a backdoor, achieving persistent control.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, defacement, malware distribution, potential for lateral movement to other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Permissions:**  The web server user should have *read-only* access to the *vast majority* of the Grav directory.  Write access must be *extremely* limited to *only* the absolutely necessary directories (e.g., `user/pages`, `user/config`, `cache`, `logs`, and *specific* plugin directories *only* if strictly required, and never to core files).  Use the most restrictive permissions possible, following the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Use strong, unique passwords for *all* file access methods (FTP, SFTP, SSH, etc.).  Disable any unnecessary access methods entirely.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement a system (e.g., Tripwire, AIDE, Samhain) to actively monitor changes to critical files and directories.  This can detect unauthorized modifications and provide alerts.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Maintain regular, secure backups stored *completely outside* the webroot and ideally offsite.  Test the restoration process regularly.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help block common web attacks that might lead to file system access, providing an additional layer of defense.
        *   **Security Hardening:** Follow general server security best practices rigorously (e.g., disabling unnecessary services, keeping the operating system and web server software fully updated, using strong SSH keys).
        *   **Chroot Jail (Advanced):** Consider running the web server process in a chroot jail to limit the scope of potential damage if the server is compromised. This is a more advanced mitigation technique.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **2. Vulnerable Plugins**

    *   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in installed third-party or custom Grav plugins.
    *   **How Grav Contributes:** Grav's plugin architecture allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP code within the Grav context.  This provides a *direct* pathway for attackers if a plugin is vulnerable.  The plugin system is a core feature of Grav, and its extensibility is directly linked to this risk.
    *   **Example:** A plugin with an insecure file upload function allows an attacker to upload a PHP shell, leading directly to Remote Code Execution (RCE).  Or, a plugin improperly handles user input, leading to a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, privilege escalation, complete site compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (severity depends on the specific plugin and the nature of the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Sources:** *Only* install plugins from the official Grav plugin repository or from highly reputable developers with a proven track record of security.
        *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep *all* installed plugins updated to their *latest* versions.  Enable automatic update notifications and act on them promptly.
        *   **Code Review (Mandatory for Custom/Untrusted Plugins):** If using custom-developed plugins or plugins from less-known sources, *mandatorily* perform a thorough security code review *before* installation.  Focus on input validation, output encoding, file handling, and any interaction with the file system or external resources.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure plugins only have the *absolute minimum* necessary file system permissions.  Never grant write access unless it is demonstrably required, and scope it as narrowly as possible.
        *   **Disable Unused Plugins:** Remove or disable any plugins that are not actively in use.  This reduces the attack surface.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner that can identify known vulnerabilities in installed plugins.
        *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Explore techniques to sandbox plugin execution (e.g., using separate PHP-FPM pools with highly restricted permissions). This is a complex but potentially very effective mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Brute-Force Attacks](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_brute-force_attacks.md)

*   **3. Admin Panel Brute-Force Attacks**

    *   **Description:** Repeated attempts to guess the administrator's login credentials, targeting the Grav admin panel.
    *   **How Grav Contributes:** Grav provides a web-based administration panel, which is a standard and easily discoverable target for brute-force attacks. The existence of this panel is inherent to Grav's design.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a dictionary attack or a brute-force tool to try common passwords against the admin login page, eventually succeeding.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the admin panel, granting complete control over the site, including content modification, plugin installation, and user management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords for *all* administrator accounts.  Use a password manager.
        *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA (via a plugin) to add a crucial extra layer of security, making brute-force attacks significantly more difficult.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a defined time period.  This can be implemented using a Grav plugin or through server-level configuration (e.g., `fail2ban`).
        *   **Account Lockout:** Automatically lock accounts after a specified number of failed login attempts.
        *   **Change Default Admin URL (If Possible):** If Grav's configuration allows it, change the default URL of the admin panel to make it less easily discoverable by automated scanners.
        *   **Monitor Login Logs:** Regularly review login logs for any suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address.
        *   **IP Whitelisting (If Feasible):** If the administrators access the panel from a limited set of known IP addresses, restrict access to only those IPs.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Exposure](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_exposure.md)

*   **4. Configuration File Exposure**

    *   **Description:** Unauthorized access to Grav's YAML configuration files, potentially revealing sensitive information that could be used in further attacks.
    *   **How Grav Contributes:** Grav stores its configuration in human-readable YAML files. The file-based nature of Grav and the use of YAML for configuration are direct contributors to this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a misconfigured web server that allows directory listing and downloads the `user/config/system.yaml` or `user/config/plugins/*.yaml` files, revealing database credentials used by a plugin or other sensitive API keys.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (exposure of sensitive configuration data), potential for escalation of attacks (e.g., if database credentials are leaked, leading to database compromise).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Permissions:** Ensure *strict* file permissions on *all* configuration files.  The web server user should ideally have *read-only* access, and only if absolutely necessary.  Other users should have no access.
        *   **Web Server Configuration:** Configure the web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to *explicitly deny* access to `.yaml` files and any other sensitive file types or directories.  This is a *critical* configuration step.
        *   **Secrets Management:** *Avoid* storing highly sensitive information (like API keys, database passwords, or encryption keys) directly in the YAML configuration files.  Instead, use environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review the contents of all configuration files to identify and remove any unnecessarily exposed sensitive data.
