# Deep Analysis: Twig Template Injection in Grav CMS

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of Twig Template Injection (TTI) vulnerabilities within the Grav CMS environment.
*   Identify specific code patterns and scenarios in custom themes and plugins that are susceptible to TTI.
*   Assess the potential impact of a successful TTI attack on a Grav site.
*   Develop concrete recommendations and best practices for developers to prevent and mitigate TTI vulnerabilities.
*   Provide actionable guidance for security auditing of Grav themes and plugins.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on TTI vulnerabilities arising from *custom* Grav themes and plugins.  It assumes:

*   The Grav core itself is reasonably secure (we're not analyzing core Twig usage).
*   The attacker has some means of providing input that is used in a Twig template (e.g., through a form, URL parameter, or other data source).
*   The vulnerability exists within the `user/themes/` or `user/plugins/` directories.
*   We are *not* covering general PHP vulnerabilities, only those directly related to Twig template rendering.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine hypothetical and real-world examples of vulnerable Twig code snippets within Grav themes and plugins.  This will involve identifying patterns where user input is directly incorporated into templates without proper sanitization or escaping.
2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will construct proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to demonstrate the impact of TTI vulnerabilities in a controlled Grav environment. This will involve crafting malicious input and observing the resulting behavior.
3.  **Documentation Review:** We will consult the official Twig documentation and Grav documentation to understand the intended security mechanisms and best practices.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will refine the existing threat model entry by adding specific attack vectors and exploitation scenarios.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Analysis:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies and identify any potential gaps or limitations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Understanding Twig Template Injection

Twig is a template engine for PHP, used by Grav to separate presentation logic (HTML) from application logic (PHP).  TTI occurs when an attacker can inject their own Twig code into a template, which is then executed by the server. This is analogous to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), but instead of injecting JavaScript, the attacker injects Twig syntax.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Twig Syntax:** Twig uses delimiters like `{{ ... }}`, `{% ... %}`, and `{# ... #}` to embed expressions, control structures, and comments.
*   **Auto-Escaping:** Twig has a built-in auto-escaping feature that automatically escapes output to prevent XSS.  However, this only protects against HTML injection, *not* against injection of Twig syntax itself.
*   **Filters:** Twig provides filters (e.g., `|escape`, `|raw`, `|e`) to modify output.  The `raw` filter disables auto-escaping, making it a potential source of vulnerabilities if misused.
*   **Functions and Macros:** Twig allows defining custom functions and macros, which can be abused if they execute user-supplied code.
*   **Grav Context:**  Within Grav, Twig templates have access to various objects and variables, such as `page`, `config`, `grav`, etc.  An attacker might try to leverage these to access sensitive information or manipulate the site.

### 2.2. Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios

Here are some specific ways TTI can be exploited in Grav:

**2.2.1. Unescaped User Input in `{{ ... }}`:**

*   **Vulnerable Code (Theme):**
    ```twig
    {# user/themes/mytheme/templates/blog_item.html.twig #}
    <h1>{{ page.header.title }}</h1>
    <p>Welcome, {{ user_input }}!</p> 
    ```
    If `user_input` comes directly from a form or URL parameter without escaping, an attacker could inject Twig code.

*   **Exploit:**
    An attacker submits `{{ 7 * 7 }}` as `user_input`.  The output would be "Welcome, 49!", demonstrating code execution.  More dangerously, they could use `{{ dump(config) }}` to potentially reveal sensitive configuration data.  Even worse, if PHP functions are accessible, they could try `{{ function('system', 'whoami') }}` (if `system` is allowed) to execute shell commands.

**2.2.2. Misuse of the `raw` Filter:**

*   **Vulnerable Code (Plugin):**
    ```php
    <?php
    // user/plugins/myplugin/myplugin.php
    namespace Grav\Plugin;
    use Grav\Common\Plugin;

    class MyPlugin extends Plugin
    {
        public static function getSubscribedEvents()
        {
            return [
                'onTwigTemplatePaths' => ['onTwigTemplatePaths', 0],
                'onPageContentRaw' => ['onPageContentRaw', 0]
            ];
        }

        public function onTwigTemplatePaths()
        {
            $this->grav['twig']->twig_paths[] = __DIR__ . '/templates';
        }

        public function onPageContentRaw()
        {
            $user_comment = $this->grav['uri']->param('comment'); // UNSAFE!
            $this->grav['twig']->twig_vars['comment'] = $user_comment;
        }
    }
    ?>
    ```

    ```twig
    {# user/plugins/myplugin/templates/comment.html.twig #}
    <p>Comment: {{ comment|raw }}</p>
    ```

*   **Exploit:**  The plugin takes a `comment` parameter from the URL and passes it *directly* to the template, using the `raw` filter.  An attacker could provide `comment={{ dump(config) }}` to dump the configuration.

**2.2.3. Unescaped Input in Attributes:**

*   **Vulnerable Code (Theme):**
    ```twig
    <a href="{{ user_provided_url }}">Link</a>
    ```

*   **Exploit:**  While auto-escaping might handle basic HTML injection, it won't prevent an attacker from injecting Twig code within the attribute itself.  For example, `user_provided_url` could be set to `"{{ config.system.author.email }}"`, potentially revealing the administrator's email address.  The correct approach is: `<a href="{{ user_provided_url|e('html_attr') }}">Link</a>`

**2.2.4. Dynamic Template Includes:**

*   **Vulnerable Code (Theme/Plugin):**
    ```twig
    {% include 'partials/' ~ user_selected_template ~ '.html.twig' %}
    ```
    If `user_selected_template` is controlled by the user, they could potentially include arbitrary files from the filesystem (if the path isn't properly validated).  This is a form of Local File Inclusion (LFI) combined with TTI.

* **Exploit:** The attacker could set `user_selected_template` to `../../../../../../etc/passwd` (or a similar path) to try to read system files.

**2.2.5.  Exploiting Grav-Specific Objects:**

*   An attacker might try to access or manipulate Grav-specific objects like `config`, `grav`, `page`, `user`, etc., through injected Twig code.  For example:
    *   `{{ config.system.author.email }}` (reveal email)
    *   `{{ grav.users }}` (potentially list users, if accessible)
    *   `{{ page.content|raw }}` (if `page.content` contains unescaped user input, this could lead to further injection)

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful TTI attack in Grav can range from minor information disclosure to complete site compromise:

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Leaking configuration data, user details, or other sensitive information.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Modifying the rendered output of the site, potentially defacing it or injecting malicious content.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Causing the site to crash or become unresponsive by injecting code that consumes excessive resources or causes errors.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code (e.g., through Twig functions that call PHP functions), they could gain full control of the server. This is the most severe impact.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the attacker can manipulate user sessions or authentication data, they might be able to gain administrative privileges.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Let's revisit the mitigation strategies with more specific guidance:

1.  **Auto-Escaping (Reinforced):**
    *   **Verify:** Ensure that auto-escaping is enabled in your Grav configuration (`system.yaml`).  It should be `true` by default.
    *   **Understand Limitations:** Auto-escaping primarily protects against HTML injection.  It does *not* prevent injection of Twig syntax itself.
    *   **Context Matters:** Auto-escaping uses the HTML context by default.  For other contexts (JavaScript, CSS, URLs, HTML attributes), use explicit escaping filters.

2.  **Manual Escaping (Precise Usage):**
    *   **Avoid `raw` if Possible:**  The `raw` filter should be used *extremely* sparingly.  Only use it when you *absolutely* need to output raw HTML, and *only* after thorough sanitization.
    *   **Sanitize Before `raw`:** If you must use `raw`, sanitize the input using a dedicated sanitization library (e.g., HTML Purifier) to remove any potentially dangerous tags or attributes.  *Never* trust user input, even after basic filtering.
    *   **Example (Corrected):**
        ```php
        // Assuming $user_html contains potentially unsafe HTML
        $purifier = new \HTMLPurifier(); // Use a library like HTML Purifier
        $safe_html = $purifier->purify($user_html);
        $this->grav['twig']->twig_vars['safe_html'] = $safe_html;
        ```
        ```twig
        {{ safe_html|raw }}  {# ONLY after purification! #}
        ```

3.  **Context-Specific Escaping (Essential):**
    *   **`escape('html')` or `e` (Default):** For general HTML output.
    *   **`escape('html_attr')` or `e('html_attr')`:** For HTML attributes.
    *   **`escape('js')` or `e('js')`:** For embedding data in JavaScript code.
    *   **`escape('css')` or `e('css')`:** For embedding data in CSS.
    *   **`escape('url')` or `e('url')`:** For encoding URLs.
    *   **Example:**
        ```twig
        <a href="{{ user_url|e('url') }}">Link</a>
        <script>
            var data = {{ user_data|e('js') }};
        </script>
        <div style="background-color: {{ user_color|e('css') }};"></div>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="{{ user_alt_text|e('html_attr') }}">
        ```

4.  **Code Review (Systematic Approach):**
    *   **Regular Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews of all custom themes and plugins, focusing on Twig template usage.
    *   **Automated Tools:** Consider using static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) with security-focused rulesets to automatically detect potential TTI vulnerabilities.
    *   **Checklist:** Create a checklist of common TTI patterns to look for during code reviews (e.g., direct use of user input, misuse of `raw`, dynamic template includes).

5.  **Developer Best Practices (Crucial):**
    *   **Education:** Train developers on secure coding practices for Twig and Grav.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* user input before using it in any context, including Twig templates.  Use strict whitelisting whenever possible.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the web server and PHP processes run with the least necessary privileges.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Grav and all plugins up to date to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Security Headers:** Implement appropriate security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy) to mitigate the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Avoid Dynamic Includes:** Refrain from using user input to determine which template to include.

6. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Before any data from user is used, validate it. Check type, length, format.
    *   **Sanitization:** If you need to allow some HTML, use a well-vetted sanitization library like HTML Purifier.

7. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Ensure that the web server and any associated processes (like PHP-FPM) are running with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.

### 2.5.  Testing and Verification

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for your plugins and themes that specifically test for TTI vulnerabilities.  These tests should include malicious input to verify that it is properly escaped or sanitized.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Perform integration tests to ensure that different components of your Grav site interact securely.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Consider engaging a security professional to perform penetration testing on your Grav site to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

Twig Template Injection is a serious vulnerability that can have severe consequences for Grav websites. By understanding the attack vectors, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and adopting secure coding practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of TTI.  Regular security audits, code reviews, and developer training are essential for maintaining a secure Grav environment. The key takeaway is to *never* trust user input and to always escape or sanitize it appropriately before using it in Twig templates.
