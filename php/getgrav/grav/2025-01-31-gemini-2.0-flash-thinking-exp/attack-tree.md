## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Grav Core Vulnerabilities (High Risk Path, Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_grav_core_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Known Grav Core Vulnerabilities (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability (e.g., CVE) (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
            *   **Develop/Utilize Exploit (Critical Node):** Attackers research publicly available CVEs for the Grav core. If the application is running a vulnerable version, they will:
                *   Find and utilize existing exploits (publicly available or purchased).
                *   Develop their own exploit based on the vulnerability details.
                *   Exploits can range from simple URL manipulations to complex code injections, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), privilege escalation, or data breaches.
    *   **Exploit Grav Update Mechanism Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
        *   **Intercept/Manipulate Update Process (Critical Node):**
            *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack (if HTTP updates) (Critical Node):** If Grav update process uses unencrypted HTTP, attackers on the network can intercept the update request and response.
                *   They can replace the legitimate update package with a malicious one containing backdoors or malware.
            *   **Compromise Update Server (Less likely, but possible supply chain attack) (Critical Node):**  Attackers could compromise Grav's update servers or related infrastructure.
                *   This allows them to inject malicious code into official update packages, affecting a wide range of users.
        *   **Inject Malicious Code via Update (Critical Node):**
            *   **Replace legitimate update package with malicious one (Critical Node):**  Regardless of the method (MITM or server compromise), the goal is to deliver a compromised update.
                *   When the application updates, the malicious code is installed, granting the attacker control.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities (High Risk Path, Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_plugintheme_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Known Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Exploit Publicly Disclosed Plugin/Theme Vulnerability (e.g., CVE) (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
            *   **Develop/Utilize Exploit (Critical Node):** Similar to core vulnerabilities, attackers target known CVEs in installed Grav plugins or themes.
                *   They research CVEs, find or develop exploits, and target applications using vulnerable plugins/themes.
                *   Exploits can lead to RCE, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, or other vulnerabilities depending on the plugin/theme flaw.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack on Plugins/Themes (Critical Node):**
        *   **Compromise Plugin/Theme Repository/Developer (Critical Node):** Attackers target the source of plugins/themes, such as developer accounts or repositories.
            *   By compromising these, they can inject malicious code directly into the plugin/theme codebase.
        *   **Inject Malicious Code into Plugin/Theme Update (Critical Node):**
            *   Similar to core updates, compromised plugins/themes can be distributed as updates.
            *   Users unknowingly install the malicious update, compromising their applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Grav Configuration Vulnerabilities (High Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_grav_configuration_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Misconfigured File Permissions (High Risk Path):**
        *   **Access Sensitive Files (e.g., configuration files, user data) (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
            *   **Read sensitive files (Critical Node):** Weak file permissions allow attackers to read sensitive files like configuration files (`.yaml`), user data, or database credentials.
                *   This leads to information disclosure, potentially revealing passwords, API keys, or internal system details.
            *   **Modify sensitive files (if write access) (Critical Node):** If permissions are overly permissive, attackers can modify sensitive files.
                *   This can lead to application misconfiguration, account hijacking, or even code injection by modifying configuration files that are later processed by the application.
    *   **Exposed Configuration Files (High Risk Path):**
        *   **Extract Sensitive Information from Configuration (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
            *   **Credentials, API keys, internal paths, etc. (Critical Node):** If configuration files are accidentally made publicly accessible via the web server (e.g., due to misconfiguration or developer error), attackers can directly download and read them.
                *   This exposes sensitive information like database credentials, API keys for external services, or internal paths that can be used for further attacks.
    *   **Debug Mode Enabled in Production (High Risk Path):**
        *   **Leverage Debug Information for Exploitation (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
            *   **Information Disclosure, path traversal, etc. (Critical Node):** When debug mode is enabled in a production environment, it often reveals verbose error messages, internal paths, and potentially sensitive data in HTML comments or headers.
                *   Attackers can use this information to understand the application's structure, identify vulnerabilities (like path traversal by seeing file paths in errors), or gain insights for more targeted attacks.
    *   **Insecure Default Settings:**
        *   **Exploit Weaknesses of Default Settings:**
            *   **Default credentials (less likely in Grav core, but possible in plugins/themes), predictable paths, etc. (Critical Node):** While less common in Grav core itself, plugins or themes might use insecure default settings, including default usernames and passwords or predictable file paths.
                *   Attackers can try default credentials for admin panels or access predictable paths to bypass security measures or access sensitive functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Grav File System Interactions (High Risk Path, Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_grav_file_system_interactions__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload Vulnerabilities (in Grav core or plugins) (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Bypass File Upload Restrictions (High Risk Path):** Attackers attempt to bypass file type, size, or content restrictions implemented by the application during file uploads. Common bypass techniques include:
            *   **File extension bypass:** Changing file extensions (e.g., from `.php.txt` to `.php`).
            *   **MIME type manipulation:** Sending incorrect MIME types in the HTTP request header.
            *   **Filename injection:** Using special characters or crafted filenames to circumvent sanitization.
        *   **Upload Malicious File (e.g., PHP shell) (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
            *   **Execute uploaded file (High Risk Path, Critical Node):** Once bypass is successful, attackers upload malicious files, often web shells (like PHP shells).
                *   If the application allows execution of uploaded files (e.g., if they are stored within the web root and server is configured to execute them), attackers can gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (in Grav core or plugins) (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Exploit Path Traversal to Access Sensitive Files (High Risk Path, Critical Node):** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities where user-controlled input is used to construct file paths without proper sanitization.
            *   **Read arbitrary files (Critical Node):** By manipulating path parameters (e.g., using `../` sequences), attackers can read files outside the intended directory, accessing sensitive configuration files, source code, or user data.
            *   **Write arbitrary files (in some cases) (Critical Node):** In more severe cases, path traversal can be used to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.
                *   This can lead to overwriting critical system files, injecting malicious code, or gaining full control of the server.
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerabilities (in Grav core or plugins) (High Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Exploit LFI to Execute Malicious Code or Access Sensitive Data (High Risk Path, Critical Node):** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities where the application includes local files based on user-controlled input without proper validation.
            *   **Include malicious local file (if attacker can upload one) (High Risk Path, Critical Node):** If combined with a file upload vulnerability, attackers can upload a malicious file and then use LFI to include and execute it, achieving RCE.
            *   **Include sensitive configuration files (High Risk Path, Critical Node):** Even without RCE, LFI can be used to include and display sensitive configuration files, revealing credentials and other sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Grav Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (High Risk Path, Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_grav_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing Admin Panel (High Risk Path):**
        *   **Attempt Brute-Force or Credential Stuffing Attacks (High Risk Path, Critical Node):** Attackers target the Grav admin panel login page (often `/admin` or similar).
            *   **Password guessing (Critical Node):** They use automated tools to try numerous password combinations against admin accounts.
            *   **Using lists of compromised credentials (Critical Node):** They use lists of usernames and passwords leaked from previous data breaches (credential stuffing) hoping users reuse passwords across services.
                *   Successful brute-force or credential stuffing grants attackers administrative access to the Grav application.
    *   **Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (in Grav core or plugins) (Critical Node):**
        *   **Exploit Authentication Bypass to Gain Admin Access (Critical Node):** Attackers exploit flaws in the authentication logic of Grav or its plugins/themes.
            *   These vulnerabilities can allow them to bypass the login process entirely, gaining direct administrative access without needing valid credentials.
    *   **Insufficient Authorization Controls (Critical Node):**
        *   **Gain Access to Admin Functions with Lower Privileges (Critical Node):** Attackers exploit flaws in authorization checks, where the application fails to properly verify user roles or permissions before granting access to sensitive functions.
            *   This can allow users with lower privileges (e.g., regular users) to access administrative functions or sensitive data they should not be authorized to access, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
