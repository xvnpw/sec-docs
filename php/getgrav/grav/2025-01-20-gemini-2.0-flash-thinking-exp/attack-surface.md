# Attack Surface Analysis for getgrav/grav

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins and Themes](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins_and_themes.md)

**Description:** Security flaws present in plugins or themes developed by third-party contributors.

**How Grav Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Grav's architecture heavily relies on plugins and themes for extending functionality, making it a significant attack vector if these components are vulnerable. The ease of installing and using third-party extensions increases the potential exposure.

**Example:** A popular gallery plugin has an unpatched vulnerability allowing remote code execution through a crafted image upload.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS), data breaches, denial of service (DoS), website defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet plugins and themes before installation, checking developer reputation and reviews.
*   Keep all plugins and themes updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Remove unused or outdated plugins and themes.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS from compromised themes or plugins.
*   Consider using security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in installed plugins and themes.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Admin Panel Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_admin_panel_access.md)

**Description:**  Weak authentication or authorization mechanisms allowing unauthorized access to the Grav admin panel.

**How Grav Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The admin panel provides privileged access to manage the entire Grav installation, making it a prime target. Default configurations or weak security practices can expose this interface.

**Example:**  Using default administrator credentials, brute-forcing weak passwords, or exploiting a vulnerability in the admin panel's login mechanism.

**Impact:** Full control over the website, including content manipulation, user management, plugin installation, and potentially server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies for admin accounts.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin logins.
*   Restrict access to the admin panel by IP address or network.
*   Regularly review and audit admin user accounts and permissions.
*   Keep the Grav core updated to patch any security vulnerabilities in the admin panel.
*   Consider renaming the default admin panel URL to obscure it from basic scans.

## Attack Surface: [Direct File System Access Vulnerabilities (Due to Flat-File Nature)](./attack_surfaces/direct_file_system_access_vulnerabilities__due_to_flat-file_nature_.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities allowing attackers to directly access or manipulate files on the server due to Grav's flat-file architecture.

**How Grav Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Grav stores content and configuration in files rather than a database. This direct file access, if not properly secured, can be exploited.

**Example:** A path traversal vulnerability in a plugin allows an attacker to read sensitive configuration files or write malicious code to a content file.

**Impact:**  Information disclosure, arbitrary file read/write, website defacement, remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure proper file permissions are set on the Grav installation directory and its subdirectories.
*   Carefully review and sanitize any user input that could influence file paths.
*   Disable directory listing on the web server.
*   Implement web application firewall (WAF) rules to detect and block path traversal attempts.
*   Keep the Grav core and plugins updated to patch any file system related vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:**  Flaws in how Grav updates itself or its plugins/themes, potentially allowing for malicious updates.

**How Grav Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The update process is crucial for security. If compromised, it can lead to widespread vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A man-in-the-middle attack intercepts an update request and injects malicious code into the update package.

**Impact:**  Installation of malicious code, leading to remote code execution, website compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that updates are performed over HTTPS.
*   Verify the integrity of update packages using checksums or signatures.
*   Monitor the update process for any anomalies.
*   Keep the Grav core updated to benefit from security improvements in the update mechanism itself.
