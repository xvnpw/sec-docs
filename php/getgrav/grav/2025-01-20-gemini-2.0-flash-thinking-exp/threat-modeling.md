# Threat Model Analysis for getgrav/grav

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
    * **Description:** An attacker with administrative access (or through exploiting an authentication bypass vulnerability *within Grav*) installs a malicious plugin designed to execute arbitrary code on the server, steal sensitive data, or compromise the entire system. This threat directly involves Grav's plugin installation functionality.
    * **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, defacement.
    * **Affected Component:** Plugin system, specifically the plugin installation functionality within the admin panel.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict plugin installation to trusted administrators only.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for admin accounts, including multi-factor authentication.
        * Regularly audit installed plugins and remove any unused or suspicious ones.
        * Implement a process for security review of any custom-developed plugins before deployment.
        * Monitor plugin repositories for reports of malicious plugins.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig Templates](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_twig_templates.md)

**Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig Templates
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability where user-controlled data is directly embedded into Twig templates without proper sanitization. This allows them to inject malicious Twig code that gets executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution. This threat directly involves Grav's core templating engine, Twig.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise, data exfiltration.
    * **Affected Component:** Twig template engine, specifically the rendering process of templates that handle user input.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid directly embedding user input into Twig templates.
        * Use Twig's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `escape` filter) to sanitize user input before rendering.
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the server-side before passing data to templates.
        * Regularly audit Twig templates for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Handling](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability_in_file_handling.md)

**Threat:** Path Traversal Vulnerability in File Handling
    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided as input (e.g., in plugin parameters *handled by Grav's core*, or through direct URL manipulation *processed by Grav*) to access or modify files outside of the intended webroot. This could allow them to read sensitive configuration files, overwrite system files, or execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, potential for remote code execution.
    * **Affected Component:** File system handling functions within Grav core that process user-provided file paths.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths.
        * Use absolute paths or canonicalize paths to prevent traversal.
        * Avoid directly exposing file system paths to user input.
        * Enforce proper access controls and permissions on the server's file system.

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/arbitrary_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Threat:** Arbitrary File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in *Grav's core* file upload functionality to upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) that can then be executed on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** File upload handling mechanisms within Grav core.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers), not just file extensions.
        * Sanitize filenames to prevent malicious characters.
        * Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible.
        * If files must be within the webroot, prevent direct execution (e.g., using `.htaccess` rules for Apache).
        * Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.
        * Restrict file upload functionality to authenticated and authorized users only.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attacks Against Admin Login](./threats/brute-force_attacks_against_admin_login.md)

**Threat:** Brute-Force Attacks Against Admin Login
    * **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess admin credentials by repeatedly trying different username and password combinations against *Grav's admin login form*.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the admin panel, leading to full system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** Admin authentication system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong password policies and enforce their use.
        * Enable account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        * Consider using two-factor authentication (2FA) for admin accounts.
        * Implement CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to prevent automated brute-force attacks.
        * Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.
