## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Grav CMS (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_grav_cms__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful compromise means the attacker has gained significant control over the application and potentially the underlying server. This can be achieved through various means, as outlined in the subsequent high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Grav Core Functionality (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_grav_core_functionality__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the core Grav CMS codebase itself. These vulnerabilities, if present, can have a widespread impact across the application.
    * **2.1. Authentication Bypass (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to circumvent the normal login process to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative panels. This can involve exploiting flaws in the authentication logic, such as SQL injection (less likely in Grav's flat-file system but still possible in custom implementations or plugin interactions), insecure password storage, or logic errors in the authentication flow. Successful bypass grants the attacker an initial foothold within the application.
    * **2.2. Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * **Attack Vector:** RCE vulnerabilities are critical as they allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Grav application. This grants them complete control over the system. Common attack vectors within Grav's core include:
            * **Exploit Vulnerability in Markdown Parsing:** Attackers inject malicious code within Markdown content that, when processed by Grav, leads to code execution on the server. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying Markdown parsing library.
            * **Exploit Vulnerability in Twig Templating Engine:** Attackers inject malicious code within Twig templates or data passed to the templates. If not properly sanitized, this code can be executed on the server during template rendering.
            * **Exploit Vulnerability in File Handling:** Attackers exploit flaws in how Grav handles file uploads or processing. This can involve uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) that can then be executed by the web server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Grav Plugin Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_grav_plugin_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Grav's plugin ecosystem, while extending functionality, can also introduce vulnerabilities. Attackers often target known vulnerabilities in popular or outdated plugins.
    * **3.1. Identify Vulnerable Installed Plugin (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers first identify which plugins are installed on the target Grav application. They then check for known vulnerabilities associated with those specific plugin versions. This information is often publicly available in vulnerability databases. Once a vulnerable plugin is identified, attackers can leverage existing exploits to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Grav File System Interaction (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_grav_file_system_interaction__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Grav relies heavily on the file system for storing content, configurations, and plugins. Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Grav interacts with the file system can lead to significant compromise.
    * **4.1. Arbitrary File Write (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * **Attack Vector:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to the server's file system. This is a critical issue because it enables attackers to:
            * **Overwrite Configuration Files:** Modify critical configuration files to disable security features, change administrative passwords, or inject malicious settings.
            * **Inject Malicious Code:** Upload and place malicious scripts (e.g., PHP backdoors) within the webroot or other accessible locations, allowing for remote code execution and persistent access. This often involves exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities where the attacker manipulates file paths to write outside the intended directories.
