### High and Critical Grav-Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** Direct File Access Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities *within Grav or its plugins* to directly access sensitive files on the server. This could involve crafting specific URLs or exploiting file handling functions *within Grav's code or plugins* to read or even modify files like configuration files or page content.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive data, credentials), website defacement, potential for remote code execution if configuration files are writable.
    *   **Affected Component:** File system access mechanisms within Grav core and plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths used in requests *handled by Grav or its plugins* (e.g., through media uploads, plugin parameters, or theme functionalities) to access files or directories outside the intended webroot. This allows them to read sensitive system files or potentially write to arbitrary locations.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (accessing system files), potential remote code execution if writable files can be accessed.
    *   **Affected Component:** File handling functions within Grav core and plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in poorly coded plugins *designed for Grav* or install intentionally malicious plugins *intended to run within the Grav environment*. This could allow them to inject malicious scripts (XSS), execute arbitrary code on the server (RCE), or access sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection (if the plugin interacts with a database), remote code execution, data breaches, website defacement, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Grav plugin system, individual plugin code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** If user-supplied data is directly embedded into Twig templates *within Grav themes or plugins* without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code that is then executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, website defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:** Twig templating engine as used within Grav themes and plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Brute-Force Attacks on Admin Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to guess the login credentials for the *Grav* admin panel through repeated login attempts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Grav admin panel, leading to full control over the website, including content manipulation, plugin installation, and user management.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grav admin panel login functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Admin Panel
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into fields or areas within the *Grav* admin panel. These scripts would then be executed in the browsers of administrators, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the administrator, or deface the admin interface.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, privilege escalation, data theft.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grav admin panel interface, input fields, output rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks During Updates
    *   **Description:** An attacker could intercept the communication between the Grav instance and the update server during the update process. If the connection is not properly secured *by Grav's update mechanism*, they could potentially inject malicious code into the update packages.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of compromised Grav core or plugins, leading to full website compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grav's update mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:**  Improperly configured web servers or vulnerabilities *within Grav or its plugins* could allow attackers to access Grav's configuration files (e.g., `user/config/system.yaml`, `user/config/site.yaml`). These files may contain sensitive information like database credentials (if used by plugins), API keys, or other secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive credentials and API keys, potentially leading to further attacks on connected systems or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Grav's file system structure and how it's accessed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
