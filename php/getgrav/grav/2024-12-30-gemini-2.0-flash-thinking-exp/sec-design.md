## 4. High-Level Architecture

Grav is designed as a flat-file CMS, eliminating the need for a traditional database. Content, configuration, and user data are stored in files and folders. The system operates on a request-response cycle, primarily initiated by user interactions through a web browser. Security is a key consideration in the design, with various mechanisms in place to protect the system and its data.

Key components and their interactions:

*   **User:** Interacts with the system through a web browser, either on the public-facing front-end or the administrative back-end (Admin Panel).
*   **Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx):**  Acts as the entry point, receiving HTTP requests and directing them to the PHP interpreter. Security configurations at this level are crucial.
*   **PHP Interpreter:** Executes the Grav application code. The security of the PHP environment itself is a dependency.
*   **Grav Core:** The central application logic, responsible for request routing, content processing, security checks, and rendering the final output.
*   **Configuration Files:** Store system-wide, site-specific, plugin, and theme settings in YAML format. Access control to these files is critical.
*   **Content Files (Markdown, etc.):** Store the website's content in various formats, primarily Markdown. Protection against unauthorized modification is important.
*   **Plugins:** Extend Grav's functionality. Their integration points represent potential attack surfaces.
*   **Themes:** Control the presentation layer. Vulnerabilities here can lead to client-side attacks.
*   **Cache:** Stores processed data to improve performance. Cache poisoning is a potential threat.
*   **Media Files:** Images, videos, and other assets. Security considerations include preventing malicious uploads and unauthorized access.
*   **Admin Panel:** A privileged interface for managing the Grav site. Its security is paramount.
*   **Twig Engine:** The templating engine responsible for rendering dynamic content. Security vulnerabilities in templates can lead to XSS.

        *   Exif data containing sensitive information.

## 6. Data Flow

The following describes the typical data flow for a front-end page request, highlighting security considerations at each stage:

1. **User Request:** A user requests a page through their web browser. Malicious requests are a constant threat.
2. **Web Server Receives Request:** The web server receives the HTTP request. Web server security configurations (e.g., firewalls, access controls) are the first line of defense.
3. **Request Routing:** The web server (or a front controller) directs the request to the PHP interpreter. Misconfigurations can expose internal files.
4. **Grav Core Initialization:** The Grav application is initialized. Security checks and initialization routines are executed.
5. **Routing:** The Grav Router analyzes the request URI and determines the corresponding content page or action. Vulnerabilities in the router can lead to unauthorized access.
6. **Content Retrieval:** The Page Manager retrieves the relevant content file(s) from the file system. Access control to content files is crucial.
7. **Content Processing:** The content file (e.g., Markdown) is parsed and processed. Plugins may hook into this process. Careful sanitization of user-provided content is necessary to prevent XSS.
8. **Template Selection:** The appropriate theme template is selected based on configuration and page settings. Compromised themes can introduce vulnerabilities.
9. **Rendering:** The Twig engine renders the template, combining it with the processed content and any relevant data. Proper escaping of variables is essential to prevent XSS.
10. **Output Generation:** The rendered HTML output is generated. Ensure all dynamic content is properly encoded.
11. **Response:** The Grav application sends the HTML response back to the PHP interpreter. Response headers should be configured securely (e.g., Content Security Policy).
12. **Web Server Response:** The web server sends the HTTP response to the user's browser.
13. **User Receives Page:** The user's browser renders the web page. Client-side security measures can help mitigate some risks.

The data flow for an Admin Panel request includes additional steps for authentication and authorization before proceeding with content or configuration manipulation. These steps are critical for preventing unauthorized access.
