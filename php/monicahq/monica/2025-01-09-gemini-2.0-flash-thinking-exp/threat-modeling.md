# Threat Model Analysis for monicahq/monica

## Threat: [Exposure of Highly Sensitive Personal Information](./threats/exposure_of_highly_sensitive_personal_information.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Monica's code or infrastructure to gain unauthorized access to the database or specific user data stores. This could involve exploiting insecure API endpoints, flaws in access control mechanisms, or vulnerabilities in data rendering. The attacker might then exfiltrate sensitive data like contact details, notes, activities, journal entries, or financial information.
*   **Impact:**  Severe breach of privacy, potential for identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage for users, and legal repercussions if data protection regulations are violated.
*   **Affected Component:**  Data Storage Layer (database), API endpoints related to data retrieval, Contact Management Module, Activities Module, Journal Module, Financial Records Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers should implement robust access controls and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
    *   Regularly audit the codebase for security vulnerabilities, especially in data access and rendering logic.
    *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Users should ensure their Monica instance is hosted securely and access is restricted.

## Threat: [Exposure of Journal Entries](./threats/exposure_of_journal_entries.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to a user's private journal entries within Monica. This could be due to weak access controls on the journal module or vulnerabilities in data retrieval mechanisms.
*   **Impact:**  Severe breach of privacy, potential for emotional distress or blackmail if sensitive personal thoughts are exposed.
*   **Affected Component:** Journal Module, Data Storage Layer for journal entries, API endpoints related to journal access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers should implement strong encryption for journal entries at rest.
    *   Enforce strict access controls to the journal module, ensuring only the authorized user can access their entries.
    *   Regularly audit the code for vulnerabilities related to journal data access.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Attachments](./threats/insecure_handling_of_attachments.md)

**Description:** If Monica allows users to attach files to contacts or activities, vulnerabilities in how these attachments are stored, served, or scanned could introduce risks. Malicious attachments could be uploaded and served, potentially infecting other users or the server.
*   **Impact:**  Malware distribution, potential compromise of user devices or the server hosting Monica.
*   **Affected Component:** Attachment Handling Module, File Storage System.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers should implement secure file storage mechanisms, preventing direct access to uploaded files.
    *   Implement content security policies to restrict how attachments are served.
    *   Consider integrating with antivirus or malware scanning services for uploaded files.
    *   Restrict the types and sizes of allowed attachments.
