# Attack Surface Analysis for monicahq/monica

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Custom Fields](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_custom_fields.md)

**Attack Surface:** Insecure Handling of Custom Fields

*   **Description:**  Monica allows users to create custom fields for contacts and other data. If these fields are not properly sanitized and validated, they can be exploited for injection attacks.
*   **How Monica Contributes:** The flexibility of creating custom fields *within Monica's data model and user interface* increases the input points and the complexity of ensuring proper sanitization across all potential data types handled by *Monica's codebase*.
*   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a custom text field *within Monica*. When another user views the contact *in Monica*, the script executes, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to a malicious site (XSS).
*   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding (escaping) for all custom field data *within Monica's application logic*. Use a security-focused templating engine that automatically escapes output *in Monica's views*.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

**Attack Surface:** Unrestricted File Uploads

*   **Description:** Monica's file upload functionality (e.g., for contact avatars or attachments) without proper restrictions can allow attackers to upload malicious files.
*   **How Monica Contributes:** The ability to upload files is a core feature *of Monica* for managing contacts and information, making it a necessary but potentially risky component *directly implemented within Monica*.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image *through Monica's file upload form*. If the server *hosting Monica* doesn't properly prevent execution, the attacker can gain remote command execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to full server compromise, data breach, and service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation on the server-side (using allowlists, not blocklists) *within Monica's backend*. Sanitize filenames *within Monica's file handling logic*. Store uploaded files outside the web root *of the Monica installation* and serve them through a separate, secure handler that prevents script execution.

## Attack Surface: [Weaknesses in Password Reset Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/weaknesses_in_password_reset_mechanism.md)

**Attack Surface:** Weaknesses in Password Reset Mechanism

*   **Description:** A poorly implemented password reset process can allow attackers to take over user accounts.
*   **How Monica Contributes:**  The password reset functionality is essential for user account management *within Monica*, but its implementation *in Monica's authentication system* needs to be robust.
*   **Example:** The password reset link *generated by Monica* contains a predictable token or lacks sufficient expiration time. An attacker could guess or intercept the token and reset the user's password *in Monica*.
*   **Impact:** Account Takeover, leading to unauthorized access to personal information, modification of data, and potential misuse of the account *within Monica*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use strong, unpredictable, and time-limited tokens for password reset links *generated by Monica*. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the reset mechanism *within Monica's authentication flow*.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization Controls (RBAC Flaws)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_controls__rbac_flaws_.md)

**Attack Surface:** Insufficient Authorization Controls (RBAC Flaws)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Monica's role-based access control (RBAC) system can allow users to access features or data they are not authorized to view or modify.
*   **How Monica Contributes:**  Managing different levels of access for various user roles is crucial for data privacy and security *within Monica's multi-user environment*. This access control is *implemented directly within Monica's codebase*.
*   **Example:** A user with a "viewer" role *in Monica* can bypass authorization checks *within the application* to access administrative functionalities or modify sensitive contact information.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data, Data Modification or Deletion, Privilege Escalation *within Monica*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust and granular authorization checks at every level (UI, API, data access) *within Monica's application logic*. Regularly review and audit the RBAC configuration *of Monica* to ensure it aligns with intended access levels.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Specific Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_specific_third-party_dependencies.md)

**Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Specific Third-Party Dependencies

*   **Description:** Monica relies on various third-party PHP libraries. Known vulnerabilities in these specific dependencies can be exploited if not properly managed.
*   **How Monica Contributes:**  *Monica's `composer.json` file defines the specific third-party libraries it uses*. Vulnerabilities in these *specific dependencies used by Monica* can introduce risks.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable version of a library *used by Monica* has a known Remote Code Execution exploit. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to compromise the *Monica instance*.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, potential impacts range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update all third-party dependencies *listed in Monica's `composer.json`* to the latest stable versions. Implement a dependency management system (like Composer) and use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities *in Monica's dependencies*. Monitor security advisories for libraries *used by Monica*.
