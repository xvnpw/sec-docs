## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Monica](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_monica.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful execution means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application, including access to data, functionality, and potentially the underlying server.

**Why Critical:** Represents the highest level of failure for the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in the login mechanism to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This can involve exploiting known vulnerabilities, brute-forcing credentials, or manipulating session management.

**Impact:** Full access to user accounts and their associated data and functionalities. This is a gateway to many other attacks.

**Why Critical:**  Authentication is a fundamental security control. Bypassing it undermines the entire security posture.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection in search parameters, custom fields, or other input forms](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_in_search_parameters__custom_fields__or_other_input_forms.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL code into input fields that are not properly sanitized. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.

**Impact:** Data breaches (reading sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), and potentially remote code execution on the database server.

**Why Critical:**  SQL injection is a well-known and highly impactful vulnerability that can lead to severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection through file upload functionalities or other input mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_through_file_upload_functionalities_or_other_input_mechanisms.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands into input fields that are then executed by the server. This can occur through vulnerabilities in file upload processing or other input handling.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the system.

**Why Critical:**  Remote code execution is one of the most severe vulnerabilities, granting the attacker full control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Files (e.g., web shells) to gain remote code execution](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_files__e_g___web_shells__to_gain_remote_code_execution.md)

**Attack Vector:** Uploading files containing malicious code (like web shells) to the server due to inadequate file type validation or insecure storage practices. Once uploaded, these files can be accessed and executed, granting the attacker remote control.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the system.

**Why Critical:**  Direct path to gaining full control of the server, bypassing many other security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting SQL Injection to dump sensitive data](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_sql_injection_to_dump_sensitive_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Specifically using SQL injection techniques to extract sensitive information stored in the database.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposing confidential user data, personal information, or other sensitive details.

**Why Critical:** Directly leads to a data breach, a significant security and privacy violation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Monica's Core Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_monica's_core_functionality.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This encompasses a range of attacks targeting the fundamental features and functionalities of Monica, including authentication and authorization bypass, input validation flaws, file upload vulnerabilities, API exploits, and exploitation of third-party dependencies.

**Impact:** Can lead to account takeover, data breaches, remote code execution, and other severe consequences.

**Why High Risk:** Targets the core security mechanisms of the application, and successful exploitation often leads to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Exploiting known authentication vulnerabilities, brute-forcing weak credentials, or exploiting session management flaws.

**Impact:**  Gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Why High Risk:**  Successful bypass of authentication is a critical step that enables numerous other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authorization.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Exploiting Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the API or UI.

**Impact:** Gaining unauthorized access to data or functionalities that the attacker should not have access to.

**Why High Risk:** Leads to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and can facilitate further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) to access other users' data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_direct_object_references__idor__to_access_other_users'_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Manipulating object identifiers to access resources belonging to other users without proper authorization checks.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data belonging to other users.

**Why High Risk:**  Directly leads to a breach of data confidentiality and can affect multiple users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting flaws in how the application handles user input, leading to SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or command injection.

**Impact:** Can result in data breaches, remote code execution, account compromise, and other significant security issues.

**Why High Risk:** Input validation flaws are common and can have a wide range of severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through notes, contact fields, or other user-generated content](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_notes__contact_fields__or_other_user-generated_content.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into user-generated content that is then displayed to other users, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in their browsers.

**Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), phishing attacks, and defacement.

**Why High Risk:** While the direct server impact might be lower than RCE, XSS is highly prevalent and can lead to widespread user compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Uploading malicious files (like web shells) or exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities during file upload or retrieval.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, access to sensitive files on the server.

**Why High Risk:**  Direct path to gaining control of the server or accessing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if API is enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities__if_api_is_enabled_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Bypassing authentication on API endpoints, manipulating API parameters to cause harm, or exploiting rate limiting issues.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to API functionalities and data, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Why High Risk:** APIs often expose sensitive data and functionalities, and vulnerabilities there can have significant consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_third-party_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries and frameworks used by Monica.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Why High Risk:**  Applications often rely on numerous third-party components, and vulnerabilities in these components are a common attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Monica's Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_monica's_data_handling.md)

**Attack Vectors:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to exfiltrate or manipulate the data stored within Monica. This can involve SQL injection, authorization flaws, or API vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, and loss of data integrity.

**Why High Risk:** Directly targets the confidentiality and integrity of the application's data.
