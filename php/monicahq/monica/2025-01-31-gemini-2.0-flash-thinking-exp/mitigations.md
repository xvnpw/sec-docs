## Mitigation Strategy: [API Security for Monica API (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/api_security_for_monica_api__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Monica API Endpoints:**  If Monica exposes an API, identify all available API endpoints and their functionalities.
    2.  **Implement API Authentication for Monica API:**  Enforce authentication for all Monica API endpoints. Use secure authentication mechanisms like API keys, OAuth 2.0, or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    3.  **Implement API Authorization for Monica API:**  Implement authorization controls to ensure that authenticated API clients only have access to the API endpoints and data they are authorized to access, based on their roles or permissions within Monica.
    4.  **Implement API Rate Limiting for Monica API:**  Implement rate limiting for Monica API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service attacks and abuse of the API.
    5.  **Validate API Input and Output:**  Apply strict input validation to all API requests and implement context-aware output encoding for API responses to prevent injection vulnerabilities and XSS in API interactions.
    6.  **Secure API Documentation:**  If API documentation is provided, ensure it is securely hosted and only accessible to authorized developers. Document API security measures and best practices for API users.

        *   Injection attacks via Monica API endpoints: High risk reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Unknown. Depends on whether Monica has a publicly exposed API and what security measures are implemented by default. API security is often not enabled or fully configured by default.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   API security measures for Monica API are likely missing or require configuration. Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, input validation, and secure documentation need to be implemented for Monica's API if it is used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Integration Security for Monica Integrations (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/integration_security_for_monica_integrations__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Monica Integrations:**  Identify all integrations that Monica has with other services or applications (e.g., email services, calendar integrations, contact import/export, etc.).
    2.  **Review Security of Monica Integrations:**  Review the security mechanisms used for each integration. Ensure that secure authentication and authorization methods are used for communication with external services.
    3.  **Minimize Permissions for Integrations:**  When configuring integrations, grant only the minimum necessary permissions to external services. Follow the principle of least privilege for integration access.
    4.  **Secure Storage of Integration Credentials:**  Securely store any credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens) required for integrations. Use secure configuration management practices (environment variables, secrets management) and avoid hardcoding credentials in Monica's code.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Integration Configurations:**  Periodically audit Monica's integration configurations to ensure they remain secure and that access permissions are still appropriate. Review logs for any suspicious activity related to integrations.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Compromise of Monica through insecure integrations (Severity: High)
        *   Data breaches via vulnerabilities in Monica integrations (Severity: High)

        *   Data leakage through insecure integration channels (Severity: Medium)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of Monica through insecure integrations: High risk reduction
        *   Data breaches via vulnerabilities in Monica integrations: High risk reduction
        *   Unauthorized access to integrated services through compromised Monica: High risk reduction
        *   Data leakage through insecure integration channels: Medium risk reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Unknown. Depends on the specific integrations used with Monica and how they are configured. Integration security often requires manual configuration and review.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Security review and hardening of Monica integrations are likely missing. Secure configuration of integrations, minimization of permissions, secure credential storage, and regular audits need to be implemented for all Monica integrations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Background Job Security in Monica (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/background_job_security_in_monica__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Monica Background Jobs:** Determine if Monica uses background jobs or scheduled tasks for any functionalities (e.g., email sending, data processing, scheduled reports).
    2.  **Secure Background Job Execution Environment:**  Ensure that the environment where Monica's background jobs are executed is secure. Restrict access to the background job execution environment and processes.
    3.  **Prevent Unauthorized Job Scheduling/Modification:**  Implement measures to prevent unauthorized users from scheduling, modifying, or triggering Monica's background jobs. Restrict access to job scheduling mechanisms.
    4.  **Secure Job Data and Credentials:**  If background jobs handle sensitive data or require credentials, ensure that this data and credentials are securely managed and protected during job execution and storage.
    5.  **Monitor Background Job Execution:**  Monitor the execution of Monica's background jobs for errors, failures, or suspicious activity. Log job execution details and set up alerts for anomalies.
