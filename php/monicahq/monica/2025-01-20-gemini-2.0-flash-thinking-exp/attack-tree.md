## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Code via Contact Fields (XSS) HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_code_via_contact_fields__xss__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious input, typically JavaScript code, and injects it into contact fields such as name, notes, or other text-based fields. When other users view this contact information, the injected script executes in their browsers.
*   **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking (stealing user session cookies), account takeover, redirecting users to malicious websites, defacement of the application interface, and potentially further attacks by leveraging the compromised user's privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Files via Attachments HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_files_via_attachments_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uploads a file containing malicious code (e.g., a web shell, an executable) disguised as a legitimate file type or exploiting vulnerabilities in the file processing mechanism.
*   **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server, access sensitive data, install malware, or use the server as a launchpad for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exfiltrate Sensitive Data via Export HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exfiltrate_sensitive_data_via_export_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker, either with legitimate but limited access or through exploiting authorization flaws, uses the export functionality (e.g., exporting contacts to CSV or vCard) to extract sensitive data beyond their intended access level.
*   **Potential Impact:** Data breach, exposure of personal information of contacts, violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage, and potential misuse of the exfiltrated data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Notes/Journal Entries HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_notesjournal_entries_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to the contact fields, an attacker injects malicious code (typically JavaScript) into notes or journal entries. This code executes when other users view these entries.
*   **Potential Impact:** Same as XSS in contact fields: session hijacking, account takeover, redirection, defacement, and further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content in Relationship Descriptions/Updates HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_in_relationship_descriptionsupdates_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious content, often JavaScript, into fields used for describing or updating relationships between contacts. This content executes when other users view these relationship details.
*   **Potential Impact:** Similar to other XSS vulnerabilities: session hijacking, account takeover, redirection, and defacement.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in PHP Version HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_php_version_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities in the specific version of PHP that Monica is running on. These vulnerabilities can often allow for remote code execution.
*   **Potential Impact:** Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access any data on the server, install malware, and potentially pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PHP Extensions HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_php_extensions_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within specific PHP extensions that Monica utilizes. These vulnerabilities can also lead to remote code execution or other security breaches.
*   **Potential Impact:** Similar to PHP version vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution and server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Database System (MySQL/MariaDB) HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_database_system__mysqlmariadb__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database system (e.g., SQL injection if not properly mitigated, or vulnerabilities in the database software itself).
*   **Potential Impact:** Direct access to the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or even gaining control of the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and dependencies that Monica uses. These vulnerabilities can range from XSS to remote code execution, depending on the specific library and vulnerability.
*   **Potential Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can include remote code execution, cross-site scripting, denial of service, and other security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Session Management Configuration HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insecure_session_management_configuration_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Weaknesses in how user sessions are managed (e.g., predictable session IDs, lack of HTTPOnly or Secure flags on cookies, insecure storage of session data) allow attackers to hijack user sessions.
*   **Potential Impact:** Account takeover, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users and perform actions on their behalf, accessing sensitive data or modifying application settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Specific Authorization Checks within Monica's Features HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_bypass_specific_authorization_checks_within_monica's_features_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify flaws in Monica's code that allow them to bypass authorization checks, granting them access to functionalities or data they should not have access to.
*   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform privileged actions, data manipulation, and potential escalation of privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Monica's Password Reset Mechanism HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_monica's_password_reset_mechanism_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the password reset process (e.g., lack of proper verification, predictable reset tokens, ability to reset other users' passwords without authorization).
*   **Potential Impact:** Account takeover, allowing the attacker to gain control of user accounts by resetting their passwords.
