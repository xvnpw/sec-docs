# Attack Surface Analysis for monicahq/monica

## Attack Surface: [Insecure User Invitation System](./attack_surfaces/insecure_user_invitation_system.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in how new users are invited to a Monica instance can allow unauthorized access.
*   **How Monica Contributes:** Monica's implementation of user invitations, including token generation, validation, and usage, directly determines the security of this process.
*   **Example:** An invitation token might be easily guessable, not expire after use, or be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, allowing an attacker to create an account without a legitimate invitation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Monica instance, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers should ensure invitation tokens are cryptographically random, sufficiently long, and expire after a short period or upon first use.
    *   Implement rate limiting on invitation acceptance attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Consider requiring additional verification steps for new users beyond just the invitation token.

## Attack Surface: [Weaknesses in Password Reset Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/weaknesses_in_password_reset_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the password reset functionality can allow attackers to take over user accounts.
*   **How Monica Contributes:** Monica's code handles the generation, delivery, and validation of password reset tokens. Flaws in this logic are direct contributors.
*   **Example:** Password reset tokens might be predictable, not expire, be sent over insecure channels, or the reset process might not properly verify the user's identity.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, leading to unauthorized access to personal data, modification of information, or impersonation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers should use cryptographically secure random token generation for password resets.
    *   Ensure tokens have a limited lifespan and expire after a reasonable time.
    *   Implement rate limiting on password reset requests to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Consider using secure email delivery mechanisms and informing users about potential phishing attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Contact Notes/Custom Fields](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_contact_notescustom_fields.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into contact notes or custom fields and executed in the browsers of other users viewing that data.
*   **How Monica Contributes:** Monica's handling of user-provided input in contact notes and custom fields, specifically the lack of proper sanitization and output encoding, introduces this risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker could insert `<script>alert("XSS");</script>` into a contact's notes. When another user views this contact, the script will execute in their browser.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers must implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided data, especially in contact notes and custom fields.
    *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Monica handles file uploads can allow attackers to upload malicious files.
*   **How Monica Contributes:** Monica's code responsible for handling file uploads, including validation, storage, and serving, directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker could upload a PHP script disguised as an image, which, if executed by the server, could lead to remote code execution. Insufficient validation might allow uploading files to arbitrary locations.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, serving malicious content to other users, or denial of service by filling up storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers should implement strict file type validation based on content, not just the file extension.
    *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism.
    *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** If Monica uses serialization for data storage or transmission, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can lead to remote code execution.
*   **How Monica Contributes:** Monica's choice of serialization libraries and how it handles deserialization of untrusted data directly introduces this risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by Monica, executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers should avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
    *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure serialization formats and libraries, and implement integrity checks (e.g., using HMAC).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Field Handling](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_field_handling.md)

*   **Description:** If Monica allows users to create custom fields, vulnerabilities in how these fields are handled can lead to security issues.
*   **How Monica Contributes:** Monica's code responsible for creating, storing, and rendering custom fields directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** Lack of proper sanitization of custom field names or values could lead to stored XSS or SQL injection if these values are used in database queries without proper escaping.
*   **Impact:** Stored XSS, SQL injection, or other injection attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Developers should implement strict input validation and sanitization for custom field names and values.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when using custom field data in database interactions.
    *   Apply output encoding when rendering custom field data in the user interface.
