## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise User Account](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_user_account.md)

*   **1.1 Weak Password:** This is a primary entry point for attackers.
    *   **1.1.1 Brute-Force (HR):**
        *   *Description:*  An attacker attempts to guess a user's password by systematically trying all possible combinations of characters.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium (Depends on password policy and rate limiting)
        *   *Impact:* High (Full account access)
        *   *Effort:* Low (Automated tools readily available)
        *   *Skill Level:* Very Low (Script kiddie level)
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Should be detectable by rate limiting and failed login attempts)
        *   *Mitigation:* 
            *   Implement strong password policies (minimum length, complexity).
            *   Enforce strict rate limiting on login attempts.
            *   Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts.
            *   Monitor for suspicious login activity.
    *   **1.1.2 Dictionary Attack (HR):**
        *   *Description:* An attacker uses a list of common passwords (a "dictionary") to try and guess a user's password.
        *   *Likelihood:* High (If weak passwords are allowed)
        *   *Impact:* High (Full account access)
        *   *Effort:* Very Low (Automated tools and readily available password lists)
        *   *Skill Level:* Very Low (Script kiddie level)
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Similar to brute-force, but potentially faster)
        *   *Mitigation:*
            *   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, and disallow common passwords).
            *   Use a password strength checker (e.g., zxcvbn).
            *   Implement rate limiting and account lockout.
            *   Educate users about password security.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.1 Data Exposure via API/Routes**
    *   **2.1.1 Insufficient Access Control (HR) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   *Description:*  The application fails to properly restrict access to API endpoints or routes, allowing unauthorized users to access or modify data.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium (Common vulnerability in custom APIs)
        *   *Impact:* High (Unauthorized data access)
        *   *Effort:* Medium (Requires understanding of the API and testing)
        *   *Skill Level:* Medium (Requires understanding of API security)
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Can be detected by security testing)
        *   *Mitigation:*
            *   Thoroughly audit all API endpoints and routes.
            *   Implement robust authorization checks (e.g., using Laravel's gates and policies).
            *   Test with different user roles and permissions.
            *   Use principle of least privilege.

*   **2.2 Logic Flaws in Features**
    *   **2.2.1 Bypassing Privacy Controls (HR) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   *Description:*  A flaw in the application's logic allows an attacker to circumvent privacy settings and access data that should be hidden.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low-Medium (Depends on complexity of privacy controls)
        *   *Impact:* Medium-High (Unauthorized access to sensitive data)
        *   *Effort:* Medium (Requires understanding of privacy controls)
        *   *Skill Level:* Medium (Requires understanding of application logic)
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Can be detected by security testing)
        *   *Mitigation:*
            *   Thoroughly test all privacy controls.
            *   Perform code review focused on privacy logic.
            *   Implement explicit consent mechanisms.
            *   Use a "deny by default" approach to privacy settings.
    *   **2.2.3 Account Takeover via Feature Abuse (HR):**
        *   *Description:* An attacker exploits a combination of features or a specific feature's logic flaw to gain full control of another user's account.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (Requires a complex chain of vulnerabilities or a significant logic flaw)
        *   *Impact:* Very High (Full account access)
        *   *Effort:* High (Requires significant understanding of the application)
        *   *Skill Level:* High (Requires advanced penetration testing skills)
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* High (Difficult without in-depth security testing)
        *   *Mitigation:*
            *   Perform thorough code review and penetration testing.
            *   Look for potential privilege escalation paths.
            *   Test features in combination to identify unexpected interactions.
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
