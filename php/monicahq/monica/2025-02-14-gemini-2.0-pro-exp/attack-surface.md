# Attack Surface Analysis for monicahq/monica

## Attack Surface: [Contact Data Input and Processing (Broad)](./attack_surfaces/contact_data_input_and_processing__broad_.md)

*   **Description:**  The core functionality of Monica involves storing and managing extensive personal information about contacts.  This creates a large attack surface due to the variety of input fields and data types.
    *   **Monica's Contribution:**  Monica's design *centers* around user-provided data, including custom fields, notes, relationships, and potentially file uploads, significantly expanding the input space.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious `.php` file disguised as a `.jpg` profile picture, or injects a specially crafted string into a custom field designed to trigger a buffer overflow in a data processing library.  Another example is injecting malicious code into the "Notes" field that exploits a vulnerability in the Markdown parser.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches (exposure of sensitive personal information), code execution on the server, denial-of-service, data corruption, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (due to the sensitivity of the data and the potential for complete system compromise).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Comprehensive):**  Implement *strict* input validation for *all* fields, including custom fields.  Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good characters and formats) rather than blacklisting.  Validate data types, lengths, and formats rigorously.
        *   **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all user-provided data when displaying it in the web interface to prevent XSS.  Use context-aware encoding.
        *   **Secure File Handling:**  If file uploads are allowed:
            *   **Strict File Type Validation:**  Validate file types based on *content*, not just file extensions.  Use a library like `fileinfo` in PHP.
            *   **File Content Scanning:**  Scan uploaded files for malware.
            *   **Secure Storage:**  Store uploaded files outside the web root and with restricted permissions.
            *   **Filename Sanitization:**  Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks.  Consider generating unique, random filenames.
            *   **Size Limits:**  Enforce strict file size limits.
        *   **Markdown Sanitization:**  Use a well-vetted and actively maintained Markdown parsing library with robust security features.  Configure it to disable potentially dangerous features (e.g., inline HTML).
        *   **Import Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate data imported from external sources (CSV, vCard, etc.).
        *   **Regular Expression Security:** If using regular expressions for validation, ensure they are carefully crafted to avoid ReDoS.
        * **Limit Custom Fields:** Consider limiting the number and types of custom fields.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoints (If Exposed)](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoints__if_exposed_.md)

*   **Description:**  API endpoints provide a direct interface for interacting with Monica's data and functionality.
    *   **Monica's Contribution:**  Monica's API allows programmatic access to its core features.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a leaked API key to access and exfiltrate all contact data, or injects malicious data through API calls.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, denial-of-service, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if the API is publicly accessible and not properly secured).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:**  Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys with strong generation and storage).  Do *not* use basic authentication.
        *   **Authorization (Fine-Grained):**  Implement fine-grained authorization (RBAC).
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints.
        *   **Input Validation (API-Specific):**  Apply rigorous input validation to *all* data received through API calls.
        *   **Output Encoding (API):** Encode data returned by the API appropriately.
        *   **API Documentation Security:** Restrict access to the documentation or ensure it doesn't reveal sensitive information.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Attack Surface: [Reminders and Notifications](./attack_surfaces/reminders_and_notifications.md)

*   **Description:**  The reminder and notification system involves scheduling tasks and potentially sending external communications.
    *   **Monica's Contribution:**  Monica's reminder feature introduces the complexity of scheduling and potentially interacting with external notification services.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious reminder with a complex recurrence rule that causes denial-of-service. An attacker injects malicious content into a reminder notification.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial-of-service, spamming, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in notification services or client applications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Recurrence Rule Validation:**  Strictly validate recurrence rules. Limit the number of reminders.
        *   **Notification Content Sanitization:**  Sanitize all content included in notifications.
        *   **Secure Notification Channels:**  Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for sending notifications.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Notifications):**  Implement rate limiting.
        * **Sender Verification:** If sending emails, implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

## Attack Surface: [`.env` File and Configuration](./attack_surfaces/__env__file_and_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The `.env` file contains sensitive configuration settings.
    *   **Monica's Contribution:** Monica relies on a `.env` file for configuration.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the web server and reads the `.env` file.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Web Server Configuration:** Configure the web server to *deny* access to the `.env` file.
        *   **File Permissions:** Set restrictive file permissions on the `.env` file (e.g., `600`).
        *   **Never Commit to Version Control:** Add `.env` to `.gitignore`.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Consider using system environment variables.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution.
