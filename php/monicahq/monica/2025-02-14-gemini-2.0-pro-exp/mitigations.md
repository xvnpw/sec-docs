# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for monicahq/monica

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Research:** Investigate available MFA libraries or services compatible with Laravel (Monica's framework). Options include TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) libraries, SMS-based solutions, or integration with external providers.
2.  **Integration:** Implement the chosen MFA method into Monica's authentication flow. This involves:
    *   Adding a new database table to store MFA-related data (secret keys, recovery codes).
    *   Modifying the user registration and login processes to include MFA setup and verification steps.
    *   Providing UI elements for users to manage their MFA settings.
3.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the MFA implementation.
4.  **Documentation:** Update user documentation.
5.  **Enforcement (Optional):** Consider making MFA mandatory.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High Severity):** Reduces risk of using stolen credentials.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Makes password guessing harder.
    *   **Phishing (High Severity):** Requires the second factor even with a password.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Protects against unauthorized access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with enforcement).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination).
    *   **Phishing:** Risk significantly reduced (attacker needs both factors).
    *   **Account Takeover:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **No.** Monica does *not* natively support MFA.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Entire authentication flow needs modification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation (Context-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation__context-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All Input Fields:** List all input fields in Monica (forms, API, imports).
2.  **Define Validation Rules:** For *each* field, define specific rules based on data type and format. Use whitelisting. Examples:
    *   **Name Fields:** `^[a-zA-Z\s'\-.]+$`
    *   **Date Fields:** `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` and validate using a date library.
    *   **Email Fields:** Use a robust email validation library.
    *   **Number Fields:** Ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
3.  **Implement Validation:** Use Laravel's validation features (Form Request Validation, validation rules). Validate *both* client-side (UX) and *always* server-side (security).
4.  **Error Handling:** Provide clear error messages, but *avoid* revealing sensitive information.
5.  **Testing:** Test with valid and invalid inputs, including boundary cases and malicious inputs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents injecting malicious JavaScript.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injecting malicious SQL (with prepared statements).
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Ensures only valid data is stored.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (with output encoding).
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (with prepared statements).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Business Logic Errors:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** Monica likely has *some* validation, but it may not be comprehensive or strict enough.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review *all* input fields and rules. Focus on:
        *   **Notes Fields:** Often overlooked, prime targets for XSS.
        *   **Custom Fields (if any):** Ensure appropriate validation.
        *   **API Endpoints:** API inputs often receive less scrutiny.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Encoding (Contextual)](./mitigation_strategies/output_encoding__contextual_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Output Points:** Find all places where user data is displayed in HTML:
    *   Contact details.
    *   Activity logs.
    *   Journal entries.
    *   Custom fields.
2.  **Choose Encoding Method:** Select based on context:
    *   **HTML Entity Encoding:** For text in HTML tags (e.g., `&lt;` for `<`). Laravel's `{{ }}` does this by default, *but verify*.
    *   **HTML Attribute Encoding:** For data in HTML attributes (e.g., `&quot;` for `"`).
    *   **JavaScript Encoding:** For data in JavaScript (escape special characters).
3.  **Implement Encoding:** Use Laravel's encoding functions (e.g., `e()`, `{{ }}`, `old()`). Avoid raw output (`{!! !!}`).
4.  **Testing:** Test with various inputs, including special characters and malicious code. Inspect rendered HTML.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents injected JavaScript from executing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (with input validation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Partially.** Blade encourages encoding, but verify *consistent* and correct use.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Code review to ensure *all* user data is encoded. Check areas outside Blade templates or with custom JavaScript.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)](./mitigation_strategies/prepared_statements__parameterized_queries_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Database Queries:** Find all database interactions.
2.  **Use ORM (Eloquent):** Use Laravel's Eloquent ORM whenever possible. Eloquent uses prepared statements automatically.
3.  **Review Raw SQL (if any):** If raw SQL is *required*, ensure prepared statements are used:
    *   Define the query with placeholders.
    *   Bind user data to placeholders separately.
    *   *Never* concatenate user input directly into the SQL.
4.  **Testing:** Test all database interactions with various inputs, including malicious SQL.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents injecting malicious SQL.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with consistent use).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Mostly.** Eloquent encourages prepared statements. But developers could write vulnerable raw SQL.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Code review to find and fix raw SQL without prepared statements. Focus on custom database interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits and Dependency Management (Focus on Monica's Codebase)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_and_dependency_management__focus_on_monica's_codebase_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Integrate tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `composer audit`, Dependabot, Snyk) into the development workflow. Run on every commit and pull request.  This focuses on Monica's *direct* dependencies.
2.  **Regular Manual Audits:** Conduct periodic manual audits of *Monica's codebase*, focusing on high-risk areas (authentication, authorization, data handling).
3.  **Static Code Analysis:** Integrate tools (e.g., SonarQube, PHPStan) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities and code quality issues *within Monica's code*.
4. **Vulnerability Response Plan:** Establish a process for responding to vulnerabilities found *in Monica or its direct dependencies*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (High to Low Severity):** Addresses known vulnerabilities in Monica's libraries.
    *   **Code-Level Vulnerabilities (High to Low Severity):** Identifies flaws in Monica's code.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Increases the chance of discovering them.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Risk reduced by keeping Monica's dependencies updated.
    *   **Code-Level Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced through early detection.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Risk somewhat reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Partially.** Some dependency management is likely, but automated scanning and audits may not be fully implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Integrate tools into CI/CD.
    *   **Static Code Analysis:** Integrate tools into CI/CD.
    *   **Formal Vulnerability Response Plan:** Document the process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Email Configuration (for Reminders)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_email_configuration__for_reminders_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Review Email Sending Code:** Examine the code responsible for sending email reminders within Monica.
2. **Use a Transactional Email Service:** Integrate with a reputable transactional email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES) via their API.  These services handle SPF, DKIM, and DMARC configuration.  This involves modifying Monica's email sending logic to use the service's API.
3. **Secure Credentials:** Store API keys and other credentials securely, *not* directly in the codebase. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.  This is a configuration change within Monica.
4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting within Monica's email sending functionality to prevent abuse. This involves adding logic to track and limit the number of emails sent per user or per time period.
5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the email sending functionality, including error handling and rate limiting.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Email Spoofing (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers sending emails that appear to be from Monica.
    * **Email Relay Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents Monica's email configuration from being used to send spam.
    * **Denial of Service (via Email) (Low Severity):** Rate limiting prevents attackers from flooding the system with email requests.

* **Impact:**
    * **Email Spoofing:** Risk significantly reduced (with proper SPF, DKIM, DMARC setup via the email service).
    * **Email Relay Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (by using a dedicated email service).
    * **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced (with rate limiting).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * **Partially.** Monica likely has some email sending functionality, but it may not use a dedicated service or have robust security measures.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * **Integration with a Transactional Email Service:** Modify Monica's code to use an API.
    * **Secure Credential Storage:** Implement secure storage for API keys.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Add rate limiting logic to Monica's email sending code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Import/Export Functionality](./mitigation_strategies/secure_importexport_functionality.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Import Code:** Examine the code responsible for importing data into Monica.
2.  **Strict Input Validation (Import):** Implement *very* strict input validation and sanitization on all imported data, treating it as completely untrusted.  This is *crucial* and involves modifying Monica's import logic.  Apply the same validation rules as for regular input fields, and potentially even stricter rules.
3.  **Review Export Code:** Examine the code responsible for exporting data.
4.  **Secure Export Options:** Provide options for encrypting exported data (e.g., password-protected archives) and secure delivery methods. This involves adding features to Monica's export functionality.
5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the import and export functionality with various valid and invalid inputs, including potentially malicious data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (from Malicious Import) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious data through the import functionality.
    *   **XSS/SQL Injection (via Import) (High Severity):** Input validation prevents these attacks.
    *   **Data Leakage (from Insecure Export) (High Severity):** Encryption and secure delivery options protect exported data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach (Import):** Risk significantly reduced (with strict input validation).
    *   **XSS/SQL Injection (Import):** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Leakage (Export):** Risk reduced (with encryption and secure delivery).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Partially.** Monica likely has import/export features, but the security measures may not be comprehensive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Stricter Input Validation (Import):** Thoroughly review and enhance the import validation logic.
    *   **Secure Export Options:** Add encryption and secure delivery options to the export functionality.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Security (if enabled)](./mitigation_strategies/api_security__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Review API Code:** Examine all API endpoints within Monica.
2. **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication for the API (API keys, OAuth 2.0). This involves modifying Monica's API authentication logic.
