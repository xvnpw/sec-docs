**2.6 Logging Libraries (Implementations of PSR-3):**

*   **Component:** PHP Logging Libraries implementing the PSR-3 interface.
*   **Security Implications (Related to Specification Guidance):**
    *   **Log Injection Vulnerabilities:**  If the specification does not clearly emphasize the importance of input validation and secure handling of log messages, implementers may create libraries vulnerable to log injection attacks.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs:**  Lack of guidance on handling sensitive data in logs within the specification could lead to libraries that inadvertently log sensitive information in plain text, creating security risks.
    *   **Insecure Default Configurations:**  If the specification does not encourage secure default configurations for logging libraries, implementers may create libraries with insecure defaults.

**2.7 PHP Applications and Frameworks (Users of PSR-3):**

*   **Component:** PHP Applications and Frameworks using PSR-3 compatible logging libraries.
*   **Security Implications (Related to Specification Influence):**
    *   **Incorrect Usage of Logging Libraries:**  Misinterpretation of the specification or lack of clear guidance could lead developers to use logging libraries incorrectly, potentially creating security vulnerabilities in their applications.
    *   **Over-Logging or Under-Logging:**  Lack of clear guidance on what and how to log could lead to applications either logging too much sensitive information or not logging enough critical security events.
    *   **Dependency on Insecure Logging Libraries:**  If the specification does not promote secure implementation practices, developers might unknowingly choose to use insecure PSR-3 compatible logging libraries in their applications.
