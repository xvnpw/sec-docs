# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for php-fig/log

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Masking](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_masking.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Developers must identify all sensitive data types that might be included in log messages (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.).
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Functions:** Create functions to sanitize or mask sensitive data *before* logging. Methods include masking (e.g., `XXXX` for parts of sensitive data), hashing (one-way hash for irreversible anonymization), or removal (if data is not essential in logs).
    3.  **Integrate into Logging Pipeline:** Apply sanitization functions *before* data reaches the `php-fig/log` logger. Use log processors or wrapper functions to automatically sanitize log messages.
    4.  **Regular Log Review and Updates:** Periodically review logs to identify and refine sanitization needs. Update sanitization rules as data handling evolves.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Leakage through Logs (High Severity) - Prevents sensitive data from being exposed in log files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Leakage through Logs (High Impact) - Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data breaches via logs.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in the user authentication module for password hashing during login attempts.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sanitization is missing in modules handling payments, user profiles, API requests, and general error handling where sensitive data might be logged.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Level Management](./mitigation_strategies/log_level_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Log Levels:** Use `php-fig/log` levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, etc.) consistently based on message severity and purpose.
    2.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Configure different log levels for development/staging (verbose levels like `DEBUG`, `INFO`) and production (higher levels like `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`). Minimize `INFO` and `DEBUG` in production.
    3.  **Centralized Configuration:** Manage log levels centrally (config files, environment variables) for consistency across environments.
    4.  **Regular Review and Adjustment:** Periodically review and adjust log levels based on needs, security, and performance.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Leakage through Logs (Medium Severity) - Reduces log volume in production, minimizing accidental sensitive data logging.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) through Log Flooding (Medium Severity) - Limits verbose logging in production, reducing risk of log-induced DoS.
    *   Exposure of Application Logic and Vulnerabilities through Logs (Low Severity) - Less verbose production logs reveal less application detail.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Leakage through Logs (Medium Impact) - Lowers chance of sensitive data in production logs.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) through Log Flooding (Medium Impact) - Mitigates log flooding risk in production.
    *   Exposure of Application Logic and Vulnerabilities through Logs (Low Impact) - Slightly reduces application detail in production logs.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented with environment variable-based switching between "development" (DEBUG) and "production" (WARNING) levels.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Lacks granular control over log levels for specific application parts. Global setting only.
    *   No automated checks for correct log level configuration during deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Escaping for Log Messages](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_escaping_for_log_messages.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User-Provided Data:** Locate all instances where user input or external data is included in log messages.
    2.  **Input Validation:** Validate user input *before* logging to ensure expected format and prevent malicious payloads.
    3.  **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Escape user input before logging to prevent interpretation as commands by log analysis tools. Use context-specific escaping (JSON, shell, etc.) or parameterized/structured logging.
    4.  **Code Reviews and Security Testing:** Review code for consistent input validation and escaping in logging. Security test for log injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Log Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Prevents injection of malicious data into logs, protecting log analysis tools.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Log Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact) - Significantly reduces log injection risks, securing logs and analysis systems.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not systematically implemented. Some input validation exists, but not specifically for logging.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Inconsistent input validation and escaping for logged data across the application.
    *   No dedicated escaping functions for log messages.
    *   Inconsistent use of structured logging, relying on string concatenation which increases injection risk.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Throttling of Logs](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_throttling_of_logs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify High-Volume Logging:** Find areas prone to high log volume, especially during errors or attacks (failed logins, API errors, exceptions).
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting:** Control log generation rate in high-volume scenarios. Implement at application level (limit logs for repeated events), logging framework level (if supported by `php-fig/log` handlers), or log aggregation system level.
    3.  **Configure Thresholds and Policies:** Define rate limits based on expected volume and resource capacity. Tune to prevent flooding without hindering necessary logging.
    4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor log rates and rate limiting effectiveness. Alert on excessive log volumes or frequent rate limiting triggers, indicating issues or attacks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) through Log Flooding (High Severity) - Prevents log flooding DoS attacks by limiting excessive log generation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) through Log Flooding (High Impact) - Significantly reduces DoS risk from log flooding, ensuring application stability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. No rate limiting for log generation currently exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting missing in error handlers, exception handlers, and high-volume areas like authentication and API processing.
    *   No dynamic adjustment of log levels or temporary logging disabling during high load.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Integrity Checks](./mitigation_strategies/log_integrity_checks.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Checksum/Signature Generation:** Generate checksums (MD5, SHA-256) or digital signatures for log files or entries.
    2.  **Regular Integrity Verification:** Automate regular verification of log integrity. Recalculate checksums and compare, or verify digital signatures.
    3.  **Alerting on Integrity Failures:** Alert security admins immediately if integrity checks fail, indicating potential tampering.
    4.  **Secure Storage of Integrity Data:** Store checksums/signatures securely and separately from logs to prevent attackers from tampering with both.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Log Tampering and Deletion (Medium Severity) - Detects unauthorized log modification, aiding in identifying security breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Log Tampering and Deletion (Medium Impact) - Provides detection of log tampering, improving log reliability for incident response.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. No log integrity checks are in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No checksum/signature generation for logs.
    *   No automated log integrity verification processes.
    *   No alerting for log integrity failures.
