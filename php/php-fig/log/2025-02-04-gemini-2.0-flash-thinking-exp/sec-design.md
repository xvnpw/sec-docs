# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: To standardize logging interfaces in PHP.
 - Priority: Increase interoperability between different PHP logging libraries and frameworks.
 - Goal: Simplify the process of switching logging implementations in PHP projects.
 - Priority: Promote best practices for logging in PHP applications.
 - Goal: Reduce vendor lock-in for logging solutions in PHP ecosystem.
 - Priority: Improve the maintainability and understandability of PHP codebases that utilize logging.

- Most Important Business Risks:
 - Risk: Lack of adoption by the PHP community, leading to continued fragmentation of logging interfaces.
 - Risk: Specification flaws or ambiguities that could lead to inconsistent implementations and interoperability issues.
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in implementations of the PSR-3 interface (although the interface itself is not executable code, implementations are).
 - Risk: Misinterpretation of the specification by developers, leading to incorrect usage and potential issues.
 - Risk: Changes in the PHP ecosystem that could render the specification obsolete or less relevant over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Version control using Git (GitHub). Implemented in: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Publicly accessible repository for transparency and community review. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Issue tracking system for reporting and managing issues. Implemented in: GitHub repository issue tracker.
 - security control: Pull Request process for contributions, allowing for code review. Implemented in: GitHub Pull Requests.

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered flaws in the specification itself.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community review for identifying security considerations in implementations.
 - accepted risk: Risk of misinterpretations of the specification leading to insecure implementations.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - recommended security control: Formal security review of the specification document by security experts.
 - recommended security control: Provide clear security guidance for implementers of the PSR-3 interface, focusing on common logging security pitfalls (e.g., injection vulnerabilities).
 - recommended security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security concerns related to the specification and its implementations.
 - recommended security control: Regularly review and update the specification to address emerging security threats and best practices.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the PSR-3 specification itself. Authentication is relevant for systems that *use* logging, but not for the interface definition.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the PSR-3 specification itself. Authorization is relevant for systems that *use* logging to control access to logs, but not for the interface definition.
 - Input Validation: Highly relevant for implementations of the PSR-3 interface. Implementations MUST ensure that data being logged is properly sanitized to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., log injection). The specification should emphasize the importance of input validation in implementations.
 - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the PSR-3 interface itself. Cryptography might be relevant in logging implementations if logs need to be encrypted for storage or transmission, but this is outside the scope of the interface definition. However, the specification could consider mentioning the importance of secure logging practices, including potential encryption of sensitive data in logs, as a best practice for implementers.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Ensuring interoperability of PHP logging libraries.
 - Promoting consistent logging practices in the PHP ecosystem.
 - Maintaining the credibility and authority of PHP-FIG as a standards body.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Specification Document: High sensitivity. Integrity and accuracy are crucial for its purpose. Public availability is also important.
 - Website Content: Medium sensitivity. Availability and integrity are important for disseminating the specification.
 - GitHub Repository: Medium sensitivity. Integrity and availability are important for collaboration and version control.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the intended audience for this design document (technical, business, security)?
 - Are there any specific security concerns that are particularly important for the PSR-3 specification?
 - What level of detail is required for the threat modeling exercise that will follow this document?
 - Are there any existing security policies or guidelines that should be considered?

- Assumptions:
 - The primary goal is to create a well-structured and informative design document suitable for threat modeling.
 - The focus is on the PSR-3 specification itself and the processes around its creation and publication, rather than implementations of the interface.
 - Security considerations are important for the specification to guide secure implementations and prevent potential issues arising from misinterpretations or flaws in the specification.
 - The php-fig website is the primary channel for publishing and distributing the PSR-3 specification.
 - The GitHub repository is the primary platform for collaboration and version control of the specification.
