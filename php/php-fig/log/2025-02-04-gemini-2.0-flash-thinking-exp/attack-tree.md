## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Exploit Log Injection Vulnerabilities Path](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__exploit_log_injection_vulnerabilities_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious data into log messages, aiming to manipulate log files, downstream log processing, or databases (if logs are stored there).
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Log File Injection:**
        *   **Attack:** Injecting control characters or code snippets into log messages that are written to log files.
        *   **Impact:** Log manipulation, potential code execution on systems processing logs.
        *   **Mitigation:** Output encoding/escaping of log messages, secure log processing tools, principle of least privilege for log access.
    *   **Database Injection (if logging to database - implementation specific) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Injecting SQL/NoSQL commands into log messages when logs are written to a database without proper sanitization.
        *   **Impact:** Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
        *   **Mitigation:** Parameterized queries/prepared statements for database logging, input sanitization specific to database context, principle of least privilege for database access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Abuse Logging Functionality for Denial of Service (DoS) Path](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__abuse_logging_functionality_for_denial_of_service__dos__path.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers intentionally generate excessive log messages to overwhelm system resources, leading to application unavailability.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Log Flooding [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Generating a large volume of requests or actions that trigger excessive logging.
        *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion (disk space, CPU, I/O).
        *   **Mitigation:** Rate limiting, log level control, log rotation and archiving, resource monitoring and alerting.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Exploit Information Disclosure via Logs [CRITICAL NODE] Path](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__exploit_information_disclosure_via_logs__critical_node__path.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers unintentionally log sensitive information in log messages, which can be accessed by attackers.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Sensitive Data Logging [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Application logs sensitive user data (passwords, API keys, PII) or internal system details.
        *   **Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations, reputational damage, aiding further attacks.
        *   **Mitigation:** Data minimization in logging, data masking/redaction, code reviews and security audits, developer training.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Error Message Leakage [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Application logs verbose error messages revealing sensitive internal details (paths, configurations, etc.).
        *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, aiding attackers in reconnaissance and further attacks.
        *   **Mitigation:** Generic error messages in production, error handling and sanitization, log level configuration (production vs. development).

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Log Storage [CRITICAL NODE] Path (within Exploit Configuration/Implementation Flaws)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_log_storage__critical_node__path__within_exploit_configurationimplementation_flaws_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Logs are stored in insecure locations or with weak permissions, allowing unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Logs stored in publicly accessible locations (web-accessible directory) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Logs are placed within the web root, making them directly accessible via the internet.
        *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, access to all logged information, including sensitive data.
        *   **Mitigation:** Secure log storage location outside web root, regular security audits.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK] Logs stored with weak file permissions allowing unauthorized access [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** File permissions on log files and directories are too permissive, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read them.
        *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, access to all logged information by unauthorized users on the server.
        *   **Mitigation:** Restrict file permissions, principle of least privilege, regular security audits and file permission checks.
