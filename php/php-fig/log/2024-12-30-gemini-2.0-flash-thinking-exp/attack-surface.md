Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing on elements directly involving the log and with high or critical severity:

**Key Attack Surfaces Introduced by `php-fig/log` (High & Critical Severity, Direct Log Involvement):**

* **Log Injection:**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or data into log messages.
    * **How Log Contributes:** The library's primary function is to record messages, making it a direct conduit for injected content if input is not sanitized before logging.
    * **Example:**
        * A user submits a comment containing `<script>steal_cookie()</script>`.
        * The application logs this comment directly using `$logger->info($comment);`.
        * An administrator viewing the raw log file in a web browser without proper escaping executes the script, potentially exposing their session cookie.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Log Forgery:** Injecting misleading information to cover tracks.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Log Viewers:** If logs are viewed through a web interface.
        * **Command Injection (Indirect):** If log files are processed by other systems without sanitization.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Sanitize User Input Before Logging:**  Use appropriate encoding functions (e.g., `htmlspecialchars` for HTML output) before logging any user-supplied data.
        * **Avoid Logging Raw User Input Directly:**  Structure log messages with static parts and user data as separate parameters if possible.
        * **Secure Log Viewing Interfaces:** Ensure any interface used to view logs properly escapes output to prevent XSS.

* **Information Disclosure via Logs:**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information is unintentionally exposed in log files.
    * **How Log Contributes:** The library faithfully records what the application tells it to, including potentially sensitive data if developers are not careful.
    * **Example:**
        * A developer logs a database query containing a user's password: `$logger->debug("Executing query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE password = '" . $_POST['password'] . "'");`
        * This password is now stored in the log file, potentially accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Exposure of Credentials:** Passwords, API keys, etc.
        * **Exposure of Personal Data:** Names, addresses, financial information.
        * **Exposure of Internal System Details:**  Revealing application architecture or vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive information before logging.
        * **Use Appropriate Logging Levels:**  Ensure debug or verbose logging levels that might contain sensitive data are not enabled in production environments.
        * **Secure Log File Storage:**  Implement strong access controls on log files and directories to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
