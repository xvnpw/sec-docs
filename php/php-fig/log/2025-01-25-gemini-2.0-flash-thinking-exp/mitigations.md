# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for php-fig/log

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Log Messages (using php-fig/log)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_log_messages__using_php-figlog_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Identify Sensitive Data Points:** Within your application code, pinpoint where sensitive data (PII, secrets, etc.) might be included in log messages *before* you use `php-fig/log` to log them.
    *   Step 2: **Create Sanitization Functions:** Develop functions to sanitize this sensitive data *before* it's passed to `php-fig/log` methods. These functions should redact, mask, or remove sensitive parts.
    *   Step 3: **Apply Sanitization Before Logging with php-fig/log:**  Modify your code to call these sanitization functions *immediately before* you use methods from the `LoggerInterface` (like `log()`, `info()`, `error()`) to log the data. Ensure the *sanitized* version is passed to `php-fig/log`.
    *   Step 4: **Code Review for php-fig/log Usage:** Review code specifically where `php-fig/log` is used to ensure sanitization is consistently applied to relevant log messages.
    *   Step 5: **Testing Log Output from php-fig/log:** Test your application and inspect the actual logs generated by your `php-fig/log` implementation to verify that sensitive data is effectively sanitized and not present in the output.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Leakage (Severity: **High**) - Sensitive data logged via `php-fig/log` could be exposed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Leakage: **High Reduction** - Prevents sensitive data from being logged through `php-fig/log`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Project Specific: Describe if and where sanitization is implemented before using `php-fig/log`. E.g., "Partially implemented for password logging before calling `$logger->info()` in `src/Security/AuthenticationService.php`."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Project Specific: Describe where sanitization is missing before using `php-fig/log`. E.g., "Sanitization is not yet implemented for user input data logged via `$logger->debug()` during form submissions in controllers, specifically in `src/Controller/FormController.php`."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Log Levels Granularity (using php-fig/log)](./mitigation_strategies/control_log_levels_granularity__using_php-figlog_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Define Log Level Usage Policy for php-fig/log:** Establish clear guidelines for using `php-fig/log`'s log levels (`debug`, `info`, etc.) within your application. Decide what types of events should be logged at each level when using `php-fig/log`.
    *   Step 2: **Configure php-fig/log Implementation Log Levels per Environment:** Configure your chosen `php-fig/log` implementation to respect different log levels based on the environment (development, production). Most implementations allow setting a minimum log level.
        *   **Development:** Configure your `php-fig/log` implementation to log at `debug` or `info` level to capture detailed information when using `php-fig/log`.
        *   **Production:** Configure your `php-fig/log` implementation to log at `warning`, `error`, or `critical` level to minimize verbosity when using `php-fig/log` in production.
    *   Step 3: **Environment-Based Configuration for php-fig/log:** Use environment variables or configuration files to dynamically set the log level of your `php-fig/log` implementation based on the environment. Ensure your application reads this configuration and passes it to your `php-fig/log` setup.
    *   Step 4: **Review and Adjust php-fig/log Level Configuration:** Periodically review your `php-fig/log` level policy and configuration to ensure they are still appropriate and effective for your application's needs and security posture.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Leakage (Severity: **Medium**) - Verbose logging via `php-fig/log` in production can increase the risk of accidental sensitive data logging.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding (Severity: **Medium**) - Excessive logging via `php-fig/log` can contribute to log flooding.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Leakage: **Medium Reduction** - Reduces accidental sensitive data logging via `php-fig/log` in production.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding: **Medium Reduction** - Helps control log volume generated by `php-fig/log`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Project Specific: Describe if and where log level control is implemented for your `php-fig/log` setup. E.g., "Log level for Monolog (our `php-fig/log` implementation) is configured via environment variable `APP_LOG_LEVEL` in `config/monolog.php`."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Project Specific: Describe where log level control is missing or could be improved in your `php-fig/log` setup. E.g., "Currently, log level is globally configured for the entire `php-fig/log` instance. Granular control per module or component using different `php-fig/log` instances is missing."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Structured Logging (with php-fig/log)](./mitigation_strategies/use_structured_logging__with_php-figlog_.md)

    *   Step 1: **Choose Structured Logging Format for php-fig/log:** Decide to use a structured format like JSON when logging with `php-fig/log`.
    *   Step 2: **Modify Logging Statements for php-fig/log Context:** Refactor your code to pass data as structured arrays or objects within the `context` parameter of `php-fig/log` methods (e.g., `$logger->info("User logged in", ['user_id' => $userId, 'ip_address' => $ip]);`). Avoid concatenating strings for structured data when using `php-fig/log`.
    *   Step 3: **Configure php-fig/log Handlers for Structured Output:** Configure the handlers in your `php-fig/log` implementation (e.g., Monolog formatters) to output logs in your chosen structured format (like JSON).
    *   Step 4: **Utilize Structured Log Analysis Tools for php-fig/log Output:** Ensure your log analysis tools are capable of parsing and processing the structured logs generated by your `php-fig/log` setup.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Log Injection Vulnerabilities (Severity: **Medium**) - Structured logging with `php-fig/log` makes log injection harder.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Log Injection Vulnerabilities: **Medium Reduction** - Reduces the risk of log injection attacks when using `php-fig/log`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Project Specific: Describe if and where structured logging is implemented with `php-fig/log`. E.g., "Structured logging using JSON format is implemented for application logs using Monolog as our `php-fig/log` implementation. See `config/monolog.php`."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Project Specific: Describe where structured logging is missing or could be improved with `php-fig/log`. E.g., "Legacy modules still use plain text logging even when using `$logger->info()`. Migration to structured context data for all `php-fig/log` usage is pending."]
