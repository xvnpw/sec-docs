## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal to Access Sensitive Files](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_to_access_sensitive_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious path sequences (like "..") into data that the application logs, and the logging implementation fails to sanitize these paths. This allows the attacker to potentially access files outside the intended log directory if the logging mechanism or a log analysis tool attempts to resolve or access these logged paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via Logged Data](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_logged_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious code into data that the application logs. If this logged data is later processed in a way that allows code execution (e.g., used in a template engine without proper escaping), the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Log Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_log_flooding.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends malicious requests or exploits application logic to generate an excessive number of log entries. This can fill up disk space, overload the logging system, and potentially crash the application, leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Log Files](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_log_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application logs sensitive information (like secrets, credentials, or PII), and the log files are accessible to unauthorized individuals due to weak file permissions or storage in a publicly accessible location.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Logging Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_logging_implementation.md)

**Description:** This represents the overarching goal of exploiting weaknesses within the logging mechanism itself. Success here means the attacker has found a way to leverage the logging functionality for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Logs User-Controlled Data in Path](./attack_tree_paths/application_logs_user-controlled_data_in_path.md)

**Description:** This node highlights the dangerous practice of including user-provided data directly into file paths that are subsequently logged. Without proper sanitization, this becomes a prime target for path traversal attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logging Implementation Doesn't Sanitize Paths](./attack_tree_paths/logging_implementation_doesn't_sanitize_paths.md)

**Description:** This node represents a vulnerability in the logging library or its configuration where it fails to properly sanitize file paths before attempting to access or log them, enabling path traversal attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Logs User-Controlled Data](./attack_tree_paths/application_logs_user-controlled_data.md)

**Description:** This node signifies the inclusion of user-provided data within log messages. While sometimes necessary, it's a critical point for injection vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logged Data is Processed Unsafely](./attack_tree_paths/logged_data_is_processed_unsafely.md)

**Description:** This node highlights the danger of using logged data in contexts where it can be interpreted and executed as code (e.g., `eval()` or template engines without proper escaping).

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Requests Designed to Trigger Logging](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_requests_designed_to_trigger_logging.md)

**Description:** This node represents a direct action an attacker can take to flood the logs, aiming to cause a denial of service by overwhelming the logging system or filling up storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sensitive Data Logged](./attack_tree_paths/sensitive_data_logged.md)

**Description:** This node signifies the presence of sensitive information (secrets, credentials, PII) within the log files. This makes the logs a high-value target for attackers seeking to steal confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Log Files are Accessible](./attack_tree_paths/log_files_are_accessible.md)

**Description:** This node represents a failure in securing the storage location of log files, making them accessible to unauthorized individuals who can then read the sensitive information they contain.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Directly Uses User Input in Log Message](./attack_tree_paths/application_directly_uses_user_input_in_log_message.md)

**Description:** This node highlights the most direct and often riskiest way user-controlled data ends up in logs, significantly increasing the likelihood of various injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Log Data Used in Template Engine Without Proper Escaping](./attack_tree_paths/log_data_used_in_template_engine_without_proper_escaping.md)

**Description:** This node specifies a common scenario where logged data, especially if it contains user input, can be interpreted as template code and executed if not properly escaped, leading to code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Logs Secrets or Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/application_logs_secrets_or_credentials.md)

**Description:** This node represents the logging of highly sensitive authentication information, which, if compromised, allows an attacker to impersonate legitimate users or gain privileged access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Logs Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](./attack_tree_paths/application_logs_personally_identifiable_information__pii_.md)

**Description:** This node represents the logging of data that can be used to identify an individual, which, if compromised, can lead to privacy violations, identity theft, and legal repercussions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak File Permissions on Log Files](./attack_tree_paths/weak_file_permissions_on_log_files.md)

**Description:** This node highlights a common misconfiguration where log files are stored with overly permissive access rights, allowing unauthorized users to read their contents.
