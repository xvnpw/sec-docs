## Deep Analysis: Application Logs User-Controlled Data in Path

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Application Logs User-Controlled Data in Path," focusing on the risks, potential exploits, and mitigation strategies within the context of an application utilizing the `php-fig/log` library.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the application's practice of directly incorporating user-provided data into the file paths used for logging. Without proper sanitization or validation, this creates a significant security vulnerability, primarily leading to **path traversal attacks**.

**How it Works:**

1. **User Input:** An attacker manipulates user-controllable data that is intended to be included in the log file path. This could be through various input vectors like:
    * **Form Fields:** Data submitted through web forms.
    * **Query Parameters:** Values passed in the URL.
    * **HTTP Headers:** Information within HTTP requests.
    * **API Requests:** Data sent to the application's API endpoints.
    * **Filename Uploads:**  The name of an uploaded file.

2. **Path Construction:** The application takes this user-provided data and directly incorporates it into the file path used for logging. For example:

   ```php
   use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;

   class MyService {
       private LoggerInterface $logger;
       private string $logDirectory;

       public function __construct(LoggerInterface $logger, string $logDirectory) {
           $this->logger = $logger;
           $this->logDirectory = $logDirectory;
       }

       public function processUserAction(string $username, string $actionDetails): void {
           $logFileName = $this->logDirectory . '/' . $username . '.log'; // Vulnerable!
           $this->logger->info("User action: {details}", ['details' => $actionDetails], ['log_file' => $logFileName]);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Path Traversal Exploitation:** An attacker can inject special characters and sequences into the user-controlled data to manipulate the intended log file path. Common techniques include:
    * **`../` (Dot-Dot-Slash):**  Moving up one directory level. Repeated use allows traversal to arbitrary directories.
    * **Absolute Paths:** Providing a full path to a sensitive file on the server.

4. **Malicious Logging:**  The application, unaware of the manipulation, writes log entries to the attacker-controlled path.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

Consider the vulnerable code snippet above. If a user provides the username `../../../../etc/passwd`, the resulting `logFileName` would be:

```
/var/log/my_app/../../../../etc/passwd.log
```

While the application intends to log to `/var/log/my_app/`, the `../` sequences will cause the logging to attempt to write to `/etc/passwd.log`. Depending on file permissions and the logging mechanism, this could lead to:

* **Information Disclosure:** If the application has write permissions to the target directory, it might overwrite or create a log file containing sensitive information from the targeted file (though unlikely in this specific `passwd` example due to permissions). More realistically, attackers might target configuration files or other application-specific data.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Repeated attempts to write to restricted locations could potentially consume resources or trigger errors, leading to a denial of service.
* **Log Injection:**  While not directly related to path traversal, if the attacker can control the content being logged, they could inject malicious log entries that could be used to mislead administrators or compromise log analysis tools.

**Impact Assessment:**

The severity of this vulnerability can range from medium to critical depending on the application's context and the attacker's goals.

* **Confidentiality:**  Attackers might be able to read or overwrite sensitive files by manipulating the log path.
* **Integrity:**  Attackers could potentially modify existing log files or create misleading log entries.
* **Availability:**  Repeated attempts to write to invalid locations could lead to resource exhaustion or application errors.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Improper handling of user data and potential exposure of sensitive information can lead to violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Several strategies can be employed to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Avoid User-Controlled Data in Paths:** The most secure approach is to avoid directly using user-provided data to construct file paths. Instead, use predefined, safe paths and potentially map user input to specific, controlled log files.

2. **Input Sanitization and Validation:** If user input must be part of the log file name, rigorously sanitize and validate it:
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Allow only specific, known-good characters (e.g., alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens). Reject any input containing other characters.
    * **Blacklist Approach (Less Recommended):**  Block known malicious sequences like `../`. However, this approach is less robust as attackers can find ways to bypass blacklists.
    * **Path Canonicalization:**  Use functions like `realpath()` in PHP to resolve symbolic links and remove relative path components. This can help detect and neutralize traversal attempts.

3. **Fixed Log Paths:**  Where possible, use fixed, predefined log file paths. This eliminates the risk of user manipulation.

4. **Least Privilege:** Ensure the application's user account has the minimum necessary permissions to write to the designated log directory. This limits the potential damage if an attacker manages to manipulate the log path.

5. **Centralized Logging:** Consider using a centralized logging system where log files are stored in a secure location inaccessible to direct user manipulation.

6. **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review the codebase for instances where user input is used in file path construction. Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Detection Methods:**

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Tools can analyze the source code to identify potential instances where user input is used in file path construction without proper sanitization.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Tools can simulate attacks by injecting malicious input into user-controllable fields and observing the application's behavior.
* **Penetration Testing:** Security experts can manually attempt to exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious input.
* **Log Monitoring:**  Monitor application logs for unusual file paths or attempts to write to unexpected locations.

**Impact on `php-fig/log` Library Usage:**

The `php-fig/log` library itself does not directly introduce this vulnerability. It provides interfaces for logging, and the vulnerability arises from *how the application utilizes* the logger. The developer is responsible for ensuring that the file paths provided to the underlying logging implementation are safe.

**Example of Secure Implementation (Mitigation):**

```php
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
use Symfony\Component\String\Slugger\AsciiSlugger;

class MySecureService {
    private LoggerInterface $logger;
    private string $logDirectory;
    private AsciiSlugger $slugger;

    public function __construct(LoggerInterface $logger, string $logDirectory, AsciiSlugger $slugger) {
        $this->logger = $logger;
        $this->logDirectory = $logDirectory;
        $this->slugger = $slugger;
    }

    public function processUserAction(string $username, string $actionDetails): void {
        // Sanitize the username using a slugger to create a safe filename
        $safeUsername = $this->slugger->slug($username);
        $logFileName = $this->logDirectory . '/' . $safeUsername . '.log';
        $this->logger->info("User action: {details}", ['details' => $actionDetails], ['log_file' => $logFileName]);
    }
}
```

In this improved example, the `Symfony\Component\String\Slugger\AsciiSlugger` is used to sanitize the username, ensuring that the resulting filename only contains safe characters. This prevents path traversal attacks.

**Conclusion:**

The "Application Logs User-Controlled Data in Path" attack tree path highlights a critical vulnerability that can lead to significant security risks. Developers must be acutely aware of the dangers of directly incorporating unsanitized user input into file paths. By implementing robust input validation, sanitization techniques, and adhering to secure coding practices, applications can effectively mitigate this vulnerability and protect sensitive data and system integrity. While the `php-fig/log` library provides a standard for logging, the responsibility for secure usage lies with the application developer.
