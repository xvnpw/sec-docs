# Attack Surface Analysis for php-fig/log

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection via User-Controlled Input](./attack_surfaces/log_injection_via_user-controlled_input.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into log messages by manipulating data that is subsequently logged by the application.

**How Log Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The logging mechanism, without proper sanitization, directly records the attacker-controlled input, making it part of the log data.

**Example:** A user submits a comment containing `"; DROP TABLE users; --"` which is then logged verbatim. This could potentially be misinterpreted by a log analysis tool or even directly executed in a poorly designed log processing system.

**Impact:** Log tampering, log forgery, information disclosure (if sensitive data is injected), potential exploitation of log analysis tools.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Sanitize User Input:**  Escape or remove potentially harmful characters before logging user-provided data.
*   **Parameterize Log Messages:** Use placeholders in log messages and pass data as separate parameters to the logging function, preventing direct injection.
*   **Validate Input:** Ensure input conforms to expected formats before logging.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_logs.md)

**Description:** Log files contain sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal information) that can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.

**How Log Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The logging mechanism, if not configured carefully, might inadvertently record sensitive data during normal operation or error conditions.

**Example:** An error message logs the full SQL query, including user credentials, to a file accessible by the web server.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of user accounts or systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  Refrain from logging sensitive information directly. If necessary, use obfuscation, hashing, or tokenization before logging.
*   **Restrict Log File Access:** Implement strict access controls on log files, ensuring only authorized personnel and systems can access them.
*   **Regularly Review Log Content:** Periodically audit log files to identify and address instances of unintentional sensitive data logging.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Log Storage Location](./attack_surfaces/insecure_log_storage_location.md)

**Description:** Log files are stored in publicly accessible directories or directories with overly permissive access controls.

**How Log Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The logging mechanism writes the log files to a location where they can be easily accessed by attackers.

**Example:** Log files are stored within the web root without proper `.htaccess` or similar restrictions, allowing anyone to download them via a web browser.

**Impact:** Information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Store Logs Outside the Web Root:**  Place log files in directories that are not directly accessible via the web server.
*   **Implement Strict File System Permissions:** Configure file system permissions to restrict access to log files to only necessary users and processes.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Log Formatters/Processors](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_log_formattersprocessors.md)

**Description:**  Custom code used to format or process log messages contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

**How Log Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  If the application uses custom logic beyond the basic logging provided by the library, these custom components, when their output is logged, can introduce new vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom log formatter attempts to parse and format untrusted data without proper validation, leading to a buffer overflow that gets logged or impacts the logging process itself.

**Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Coding Practices for Custom Components:**  Apply secure coding principles when developing custom log formatters and processors.
*   **Input Validation in Custom Components:**  Thoroughly validate any data processed by custom log components.
*   **Regular Security Audits of Custom Code:**  Conduct security reviews and testing of custom logging logic.
