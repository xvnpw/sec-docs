Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Log File Access / Disclosure" attack surface, focusing on applications using the PSR-3 logging interface (https://github.com/php-fig/log):

## Deep Analysis: Log File Access / Disclosure (PSR-3 Context)

### 1. Define Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Log File Access / Disclosure" attack surface in the context of a PHP application utilizing the PSR-3 logging interface.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific vulnerabilities related to how the application *uses* PSR-3, even though PSR-3 itself doesn't dictate storage.
*   Understand the root causes of these vulnerabilities.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the general recommendations, tailored to common PSR-3 implementations and PHP environments.
*   Assess the residual risk after implementing mitigations.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   **PHP Applications:**  The analysis is specific to applications written in PHP.
*   **PSR-3 Loggers:**  We assume the application uses a PSR-3 compliant logger (e.g., Monolog, KLogger, etc.).  The specific *implementation* of the logger is a key factor.
*   **Log File Storage:**  The primary focus is on vulnerabilities related to the *storage* and *access control* of log files generated by the PSR-3 logger.  This includes file system permissions, directory locations, and web server configurations.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  We're particularly concerned with the exposure of sensitive data that might be inadvertently logged.
* **Common Web Servers:** We will consider common web server setups like Apache and Nginx.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   **Network-level attacks:**  We're not focusing on attacks that intercept log data in transit (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks on a remote logging service).  This is a separate attack surface.
*   **Vulnerabilities within the PSR-3 implementation itself:** We assume the chosen PSR-3 implementation is free of known vulnerabilities.  We're focusing on how the *application* uses it.
*   **Log injection attacks:** While related, log injection (where an attacker can inject malicious content into log files) is a distinct attack surface and will not be the primary focus.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Implementation Review:** Analyze how common PSR-3 implementations (like Monolog) handle file storage by default.  Identify common configuration options and their security implications.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Construct hypothetical (but realistic) code snippets demonstrating how developers might (incorrectly) configure and use a PSR-3 logger, leading to vulnerabilities.
3.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Examine common web server configurations (Apache, Nginx) and how they might interact with log file locations to create vulnerabilities.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific threat actors and attack scenarios related to log file access.
5.  **Mitigation Deep Dive:**  Expand on the provided mitigation strategies, providing specific examples and configuration instructions.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the remaining risk after implementing the mitigations.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

#### 4.1 Implementation Review (Monolog Example)

Monolog, a popular PSR-3 implementation, uses `StreamHandler` by default to write logs to files.  Key configuration points:

*   **`$path`:**  The file path where logs are written.  This is *crucially* important.  If this path is within the web root, it's a major vulnerability.
*   **`$level`:**  The minimum logging level.  While not directly related to file access, logging too much information (e.g., `DEBUG` in production) increases the risk if the file is exposed.
*   **`$filePermission`:**  Allows setting the file permissions (e.g., `0644`).  The default might be too permissive.
*   **`$useLocking`:**  Uses file locking to prevent race conditions.  While important for data integrity, it doesn't directly prevent unauthorized access.

Other handlers (e.g., `RotatingFileHandler`) have similar configuration options related to file paths and permissions.

#### 4.2 Hypothetical Code Review (Vulnerable Examples)

**Vulnerable Example 1:  Default Path in Web Root**

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

// VULNERABLE:  Logs to a file within the web root!
$log = new Logger('my_app');
$log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('logs/app.log', Logger::DEBUG));

$log->info('User logged in', ['username' => $_POST['username']]); // Potentially logs sensitive data
$log->debug('SQL Query', ['query' => $sql]); // Logs potentially sensitive SQL
```

This is vulnerable because `logs/app.log` is likely accessible via `http://example.com/logs/app.log`.

**Vulnerable Example 2:  Overly Permissive Permissions**

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

// VULNERABLE:  Uses overly permissive file permissions.
$log = new Logger('my_app');
$log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('/var/log/myapp/app.log', Logger::DEBUG, true, 0666)); // 0666 is world-readable!

$log->info('User logged in', ['username' => $_POST['username']]);
```

This is vulnerable because *any* user on the system can read the log file.

**Vulnerable Example 3: Logging Sensitive Data**

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

$log = new Logger('my_app');
$log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('/var/log/myapp/app.log', Logger::DEBUG, true, 0600)); //Permissions are good

//VULNERABLE: Logs sensitive data
$log->info('User logged in', ['username' => $_POST['username'], 'password' => $_POST['password']]);
```
Even with correct permissions, logging sensitive data like passwords is a critical vulnerability.

#### 4.3 Configuration Analysis (Apache/Nginx)

*   **Apache:**  The `DocumentRoot` directive defines the web root.  If log files are placed within this directory (or a subdirectory), they are directly accessible.  `.htaccess` files can be used to restrict access, but this is often misconfigured or forgotten.
*   **Nginx:**  The `root` directive in a `location` block defines the web root.  Similar to Apache, placing log files within this root is dangerous.  `location` blocks can be used to deny access, but this requires careful configuration.

**Example Vulnerable Apache Configuration:**

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html  # Log files within this directory are vulnerable!

    # ... other configurations ...
</VirtualHost>
```

**Example Vulnerable Nginx Configuration:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    root /var/www/html;  # Log files within this directory are vulnerable!

    # ... other configurations ...
}
```

#### 4.4 Threat Modeling

*   **Threat Actors:**
    *   **Script Kiddies:**  May use automated tools to scan for exposed log files.
    *   **Opportunistic Attackers:**  May stumble upon exposed logs while probing for other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Targeted Attackers:**  May specifically target log files to gain information for a more sophisticated attack.
    *   **Insiders:**  Employees or contractors with limited system access might try to read log files they shouldn't.

*   **Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Direct URL Access:**  Attacker guesses or discovers the URL of the log file (e.g., `http://example.com/logs/app.log`).
    *   **Directory Listing:**  If directory listing is enabled on the web server, the attacker can browse to the log file directory and view the files.
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  If another vulnerability (LFI) exists, the attacker might be able to read the log file through that vulnerability.
    *   **System User Access:**  An attacker who gains access to a low-privileged user account on the system might be able to read log files due to overly permissive file permissions.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Deep Dive

Let's expand on the original mitigation strategies:

*   **Secure File Permissions:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Use `640` (owner: read/write, group: read, others: none) or `600` (owner: read/write, others: none) for log files.  The group should be the web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`, `nginx`).
    *   **Implementation (Monolog):**
        ```php
        $log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('/var/log/myapp/app.log', Logger::INFO, true, 0640));
        ```
    *   **Implementation (Shell):**
        ```bash
        chown root:www-data /var/log/myapp/app.log
        chmod 640 /var/log/myapp/app.log
        ```
        (Replace `www-data` with the appropriate group for your web server.)
    * **Verification:** Use `ls -l /var/log/myapp/app.log` to verify the permissions.

*   **Store Outside Web Root:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Choose a directory *outside* the web server's document root.  Common choices include `/var/log/myapp/`, `/opt/myapp/logs/`, or a dedicated partition.
    *   **Implementation (Monolog):**
        ```php
        $log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('/var/log/myapp/app.log', Logger::INFO));
        ```
    *   **Verification:** Ensure the chosen directory is *not* accessible via a web browser.

*   **Dedicated Log Server:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Use a centralized logging service (e.g., syslog, Graylog, ELK stack, Splunk) to collect and manage logs.  This separates log storage from the application server.
    *   **Implementation (Monolog):**  Use handlers like `SyslogHandler`, `SyslogUdpHandler`, or handlers specific to the chosen logging service.
    *   **Benefits:**  Improved security, scalability, and centralized log management.

*   **Log Rotation & Archiving:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Rotate logs regularly (e.g., daily, weekly) to prevent them from growing too large.  Archive old logs securely (e.g., encrypted storage, offsite backup).
    *   **Implementation (Monolog):**  Use the `RotatingFileHandler`:
        ```php
        $log->pushHandler(new Monolog\Handler\RotatingFileHandler('/var/log/myapp/app.log', 10, Logger::INFO)); // Keep 10 rotated files
        ```
    *   **Implementation (logrotate - Linux):** Use the `logrotate` utility (usually pre-installed on Linux systems) to automate log rotation and compression. Create a configuration file in `/etc/logrotate.d/`.
    * **Example logrotate configuration:**
        ```
        /var/log/myapp/app.log {
            daily
            rotate 7
            compress
            delaycompress
            notifempty
            missingok
            create 0640 root www-data
        }
        ```

*   **Avoid Sensitive Data (and Redaction):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  *Never* log sensitive data directly.  Use placeholders, redaction, or tokenization.
    *   **Implementation (Manual):**
        ```php
        $log->info('User logged in', ['username' => $_POST['username'], 'password' => '***REDACTED***']);
        ```
    *   **Implementation (Monolog - Processors):**  Use Monolog processors to automatically redact sensitive data:
        ```php
        use Monolog\Processor\PsrLogMessageProcessor;
        use Monolog\Processor\ReplaceExtraParametersProcessor;

        $log = new Logger('my_app');
        $log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('/var/log/myapp/app.log', Logger::INFO));

        // Redact password fields
        $log->pushProcessor(new ReplaceExtraParametersProcessor(['password' => '***REDACTED***']));

        $log->info('User logged in', ['username' => 'testuser', 'password' => 'secret']); // Logs: User logged in - {"username": "testuser", "password": "***REDACTED***"}
        ```
    * **Consider using a dedicated library for PII redaction.**

* **Web Server Configuration (Deny Access):**
    * **Apache (.htaccess):** If you *must* store logs within the web root (strongly discouraged), use an `.htaccess` file to deny access:
        ```apache
        <Files "*.log">
            Order allow,deny
            Deny from all
        </Files>
        ```
    * **Nginx (location block):**
        ```nginx
        location ~* \.log$ {
            deny all;
        }
        ```
        Place this `location` block within your `server` block. This denies access to any file ending in `.log`.

#### 4.6 Residual Risk Assessment

Even after implementing all the mitigations, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  A new vulnerability in the web server, operating system, or PSR-3 implementation could expose log files.
*   **Misconfiguration:**  A mistake in the configuration (e.g., incorrect file permissions, forgetting to update `.htaccess`) could re-introduce the vulnerability.
*   **Insider Threats:**  A determined insider with sufficient privileges could still access log files.
*   **Compromised System:** If the entire system is compromised (e.g., root access), the attacker can likely access the logs regardless of mitigations.

**Overall, the residual risk is significantly reduced, but not eliminated.**  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and monitoring are essential to maintain a strong security posture.  The most effective mitigation is *not logging sensitive data in the first place*.
