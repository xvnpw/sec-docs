## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Goal](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_goal.md)

*   **Attacker Goal: Exfiltrate data, disrupt application, or achieve code execution via logging. [CRITICAL]**
    *   This is the overarching goal and is considered critical because it represents the ultimate objective of an attacker targeting the logging system.  All other nodes contribute to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Log Injection](./attack_tree_paths/log_injection.md)

*   **1. Log Injection (Manipulate Log Content) [HR]**
    *   This is a high-risk area because it allows direct manipulation of the logging process.
    *   **1.1 Inject Malicious Payloads into Log Messages [CRITICAL]**: This is the core of log injection and is critical.  If an attacker can inject arbitrary content, they can potentially achieve any of the sub-goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Shell Commands](./attack_tree_paths/inject_shell_commands.md)

        *   **1.1.2.2 Inject Shell Commands (If logs are processed by shell scripts) [HR]**:
            *   **Description:**  The attacker injects shell commands into log messages. If these logs are later processed by a script that executes them (e.g., using `system()`, `exec()`, or backticks), the attacker gains code execution.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires specific, insecure log processing).
            *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise).
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depends on the complexity of the injection).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (requires understanding of shell scripting and injection techniques).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires analysis of log processing scripts and potentially network traffic).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject HTML/JavaScript](./attack_tree_paths/inject_htmljavascript.md)

        *   **1.1.2.3 Inject HTML/JavaScript (If logs are displayed in a web UI without sanitization - XSS) [HR]**:
            *   **Description:** The attacker injects HTML or JavaScript code into log messages. If these logs are displayed in a web-based log viewer without proper sanitization, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the viewer's browser.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common vulnerability in log viewers).
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High (session hijacking, defacement, data theft).
            *   **Effort:** Low (basic XSS payloads).
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (understanding of XSS).
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires analysis of the log viewing interface).

                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on error handling practices).
                *   **Impact:** High (data breach).
                *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depends on the application's error handling).
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (understanding of application logic and error handling).
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (requires monitoring log size and content for anomalies).

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Log Sanitization/Filtering](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_log_sanitizationfiltering.md)
