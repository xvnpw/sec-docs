# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for php-fig/log

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization *Before* Logging](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_before_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all logging points:**  Find every instance where `$logger->{level}()` is called in your code.
    2.  **Analyze input sources:** For each logging point, determine where the data being logged originates (user input, API responses, database results, etc.).
    3.  **Implement type-specific sanitization:**  Before passing *any* data to the logger, apply appropriate sanitization:
        *   **URLs:** `filter_var($url, FILTER_SANITIZE_URL)`
        *   **Emails:** `filter_var($email, FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL)`
        *   **Usernames/Text:** Control character removal/replacement, length limits, whitelists, and HTML-escaping *only if the log viewer renders HTML*.
        *   **Numbers:** `filter_var($number, FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT)` or `FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_FLOAT`.
    4.  **Centralize sanitization:** Create reusable functions or a class to handle sanitization, avoiding code duplication.
    5.  **Use the context array:** Pass sanitized data within the context array, *not* directly concatenated into the message string.
    6.  **Unit test:** Verify sanitization functions with various inputs, including malicious ones.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Forging (High Severity):** Prevents injection of newline characters or control characters to create fake log entries.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents injection of JavaScript if the log viewer renders HTML.
    *   **Code Injection (High Severity):** Mitigates potential code injection in vulnerable log processing tools.
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent logging of malformed data that might reveal internal information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Forging:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (if applicable).
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low (in specific cases).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial sanitization in `UserController` and `ApiRequestLogger`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent sanitization across all logging points.
    *   Dedicated sanitization functions/classes.
    *   Comprehensive unit tests for sanitization.
    *   Consistent use of the context array.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Contextual Data Handling and Masking](./mitigation_strategies/contextual_data_handling_and_masking.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify sensitive data:** List all data considered sensitive (PII, credentials, API keys, etc.).
    2.  **Choose masking methods:**
        *   **Redaction:** Replace with `[REDACTED]` or similar.
        *   **Hashing:** Use a strong cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) for correlation without revealing the original data.
        *   **Partial Masking:** Reveal only a portion (e.g., last four digits).
    3.  **Implement masking *before* logging:**
        *   **Create a masking function/class:**  This function should handle different data types.
        *   **Integrate into logging calls:** Call the masking function *before* passing data to the logger.
        *   **Prioritize the context array:**  Pass masked data within the context array.  This is crucial for structured logging.
    4.  **Unit test:** Verify masking functions correctly handle all sensitive data types.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (Critical Severity):** Prevents exposure of sensitive data in logs.
    *   **Privacy Violation (High Severity):** Protects user privacy.
    *   **Compliance Violations (High Severity):** Helps meet data protection regulations.
    *   **Reputational Damage (High Severity):** Reduces risk of negative publicity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Privacy Violation:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial masking of API keys in `ApiRequestLogger`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent masking strategy across the application.
    *   Masking of other sensitive data types (session tokens, passwords).
    *   Dedicated masking function/class.
    *   Consistent use of the context array for masked data.
    *   Unit tests for masking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Structured Logging (JSON) with Context](./mitigation_strategies/structured_logging__json__with_context.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use a JSON-supporting logger:** Choose a PSR-3 logger like Monolog with JSON formatting capabilities.
    2.  **Configure JSON formatter:** Set up the logger to use a `JsonFormatter`.
    3.  **Define a log schema:**  Establish consistent fields for all log entries (timestamp, level, message, context, etc.).
    4.  **Always use the context array:**  Pass *all* data (except the main message string) as key-value pairs in the context array.  This is the core of structured logging.
    5.  **Combine with sanitization and masking:** Ensure data passed in the context array is already sanitized and masked as needed.
    6. **Test JSON output:** Verify log entries are valid JSON and adhere to the defined schema.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Difficult Log Analysis (Medium Severity):** Enables easier parsing, searching, and analysis.
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Severity):** JSON encoding helps mitigate some injection attacks.
    *   **Inefficient Log Processing (Low Severity):** Structured logs are more efficient to process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Difficult Log Analysis:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Log Injection:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Inefficient Log Processing:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complete migration to structured logging with JSON and consistent context array usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Level Management](./mitigation_strategies/log_level_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use PSR-3 levels correctly:**  `debug` and `info` should *never* contain sensitive information.  Use `warning` or `error` as the default production level.
    2.  **Avoid verbose logging in production:**  Minimize the use of `debug` and `info` in production environments.
    3.  **Control log level dynamically:** Use environment variables, configuration files, or a runtime API to adjust the log level without redeployment.  This allows for temporary increases in verbosity for troubleshooting.
    4. **Never log sensitive information on debug or info levels.**

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Excessive Logging (Medium Severity):** Reduces log volume.
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of sensitive data in lower-level logs.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Low Severity):** Excessive logging can impact performance.
    *   **Disk Space Exhaustion (Low Severity):** Excessive logging can fill disk space.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Excessive Logging:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
    *   **Disk Space Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Uses different log levels, but `info` is the default in production.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dynamic log level configuration.
    *   Strict adherence to not logging sensitive data at lower levels.
