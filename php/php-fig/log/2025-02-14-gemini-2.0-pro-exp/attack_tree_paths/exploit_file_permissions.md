# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit File Permissions (PSR-3 Logging)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path "2.1.1.1 Exploit File Permissions" within the context of a PHP application utilizing the PSR-3 logging interface (https://github.com/php-fig/log).  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific mechanisms by which an attacker could exploit file permissions related to log files.
*   Identify the preconditions necessary for this attack to be successful.
*   Assess the real-world likelihood and impact of this attack.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent this vulnerability.
*   Determine how detection mechanisms can be implemented and improved.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where log files generated by a PSR-3 compliant logger are vulnerable due to incorrect file permissions.  It considers:

*   **Target Application:**  A PHP web application using a PSR-3 compliant logging library (e.g., Monolog, Log4php, etc.).  The specific logging implementation *does* matter, as different libraries have different default behaviors and configuration options.  We will assume a common scenario where logs are written to files.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  An attacker with *some* level of access to the web server, potentially through a compromised user account, a vulnerability in another application on the same server, or a misconfigured service.  The attacker does *not* have root/administrator privileges.
*   **Log File Location:**  The analysis assumes log files are stored in a location accessible (at least partially) by the web server user (e.g., `www/var/log`, `/var/log/myapp`, a directory within the application's document root).
*   **Exclusion:**  This analysis *does not* cover vulnerabilities within the PSR-3 interface itself, but rather the *implementation* and *configuration* of a logger using that interface.  It also excludes attacks that require root access.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Scenario Definition:**  Establish a concrete, realistic scenario of a vulnerable application.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Detail the specific steps an attacker would take to exploit the file permissions.
3.  **Precondition Analysis:**  Identify the necessary conditions for the attack to succeed.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Quantify the potential damage caused by the attack.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose specific, actionable steps to prevent the vulnerability.
6.  **Detection Strategies:**  Outline methods to detect attempts to exploit this vulnerability.
7.  **Code Examples (where applicable):** Illustrate vulnerable and secure configurations with code snippets.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1.1 Exploit File Permissions

### 2.1. Scenario Definition

Let's consider a PHP web application using Monolog (a popular PSR-3 implementation) to log application events.  The application is running on an Apache web server on a Linux system.  The Monolog configuration is set to write logs to `/var/www/myapp/logs/app.log`.  Due to a misconfiguration during deployment, the `logs` directory and the `app.log` file have permissions set to `777` (read, write, and execute for everyone).  The web server runs under the user `www-data`.

### 2.2. Vulnerability Analysis

An attacker, having gained limited access to the server (e.g., through a compromised FTP account with access to a different directory), can exploit the `777` permissions on the log file in several ways:

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Overwrite:** The attacker can overwrite the `app.log` file with a very large file (e.g., filled with random data). This can consume all available disk space, causing the application (and potentially other services on the server) to crash.
    *   **Delete:** The attacker can simply delete the `app.log` file.  While this might not immediately crash the application, it disrupts logging, making it harder to diagnose issues and detect future attacks.  If the application *requires* the log file to exist and doesn't handle its absence gracefully, this *could* lead to a crash.
    *   **Symlink Attack:** The attacker could delete the log file and replace it with a symbolic link to a critical system file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).  If the application attempts to write to the log file (which is now a symlink), it could inadvertently overwrite the system file, leading to severe system instability or compromise. This is a more sophisticated attack.

2.  **Data Loss:**  Deleting or overwriting the log file results in the loss of valuable audit data.  This hinders incident response and forensic analysis.

3.  **Information Disclosure (Indirect):** While less direct, if the attacker can fill the log file with controlled content, and if that log file is *then* inadvertently exposed (e.g., through a misconfigured web server that allows directory listing), the attacker could leak information.

### 2.3. Precondition Analysis

The following preconditions are necessary for this attack to be successful:

*   **Incorrect File Permissions:** The log file and/or its parent directory must have overly permissive write permissions (e.g., `777`, `775` where the web server user is in the group, or `757` where the web server user is the "other" user).
*   **Attacker Access:** The attacker must have *some* form of access to the server's file system, even if it's limited. This could be through a compromised user account, a vulnerability in another application, or a misconfigured service.
*   **Logger Configuration:** The PSR-3 logger must be configured to write to a file that is accessible to the attacker.
* **Application does not handle missing log file:** If application does not handle missing log file, attacker can delete log file and cause DoS.

### 2.4. Impact Assessment

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Incorrect file permissions are a common misconfiguration, especially in development or staging environments that are later moved to production without proper security review.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High.
    *   **DoS:**  Can range from minor disruption (loss of logging) to complete application outage (disk space exhaustion, critical file corruption).
    *   **Data Loss:**  Loss of audit logs hinders security investigations and compliance efforts.
    *   **System Compromise (Symlink Attack):**  Potentially very high impact, leading to complete system takeover.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Basic file system commands (`rm`, `echo`, `ln -s`) are sufficient for most of these attacks.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (for the symlink attack).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium.  File system monitoring can easily detect changes to file permissions and file contents.  However, detecting a symlink attack might require more sophisticated intrusion detection systems.

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Correct Permissions:**  The log file and its directory should have the *minimum* necessary permissions.  The web server user (`www-data` in our example) should be the *owner* of the file and directory.  Permissions should typically be `640` for the log file (read/write for owner, read for group, no access for others) and `750` for the directory (read/write/execute for owner, read/execute for group, no access for others).  The group should be a dedicated group for logging, if necessary.  *Never* use `777`.
    *   **Example (bash):**
        ```bash
        chown www-data:www-data /var/www/myapp/logs/app.log
        chmod 640 /var/www/myapp/logs/app.log
        chmod 750 /var/www/myapp/logs
        ```

2.  **Secure Logger Configuration:**
    *   **Dedicated Log Directory:**  Use a dedicated directory for log files, separate from the application's document root and other sensitive files.
    *   **Avoid Predictable Paths:**  While not a primary defense, avoid easily guessable log file paths.
    *   **Rotation and Archiving:** Implement log rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.  Archive old logs securely.  This mitigates the DoS risk from disk space exhaustion.  Many logging libraries (including Monolog) have built-in support for log rotation.
    * **Monolog Example (secure configuration):**
        ```php
        use Monolog\Logger;
        use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;
        use Monolog\Handler\RotatingFileHandler;

        // Create a logger for the application.
        $log = new Logger('my_app');

        // Use RotatingFileHandler to manage log rotation.
        $handler = new RotatingFileHandler('/var/log/myapp/app.log', 10, Logger::INFO); // Rotate after 10 files, keep INFO level and above.
        $log->pushHandler($handler);

        // ... use the logger ...
        $log->info('User logged in', ['user_id' => 123]);
        ```

3.  **Application-Level Checks:**
    *   **File Existence and Writability:**  Before writing to the log file, the application *could* check if the file exists and is writable by the current user.  However, this is generally *not* recommended as the primary defense, as it introduces a race condition (the file permissions could change between the check and the write).  It's better to rely on proper system-level permissions.
    * **Handle Exceptions:** Application should handle exceptions, that can be caused by missing or unwritable log file.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and correct misconfigured file permissions and other vulnerabilities.

5.  **SELinux/AppArmor:**  Use mandatory access control systems like SELinux or AppArmor to further restrict the web server's access to the file system, even if file permissions are misconfigured.

### 2.6. Detection Strategies

1.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use FIM tools (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire, Samhain) to monitor the log file and its directory for unauthorized changes in permissions, ownership, or content.  These tools create a baseline of the file system and alert on any deviations.

2.  **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Network and host-based intrusion detection systems can be configured to detect suspicious file system activity, such as attempts to create symbolic links or write large amounts of data to log files.

3.  **Log Monitoring:**  Monitor the logs themselves (if they are still being written) for unusual patterns or errors that might indicate an attack.  For example, a sudden flood of log entries or errors related to file writing could be a sign of trouble.

4.  **System Auditing (auditd):**  Use the Linux audit system (`auditd`) to track file access and modifications.  This provides a detailed audit trail that can be used for forensic analysis.

5.  **Regular Expression Monitoring:** Configure monitoring tools to watch for specific patterns in log files that might indicate malicious activity. For example, you could monitor for repeated attempts to write to the log file from unexpected sources or for the presence of shell commands within log entries.

## 3. Conclusion

Exploiting file permissions on log files is a relatively simple but potentially damaging attack. By understanding the attack mechanisms, preconditions, and impact, developers and security professionals can implement effective mitigation and detection strategies. The principle of least privilege, secure logger configuration, and regular security audits are crucial for preventing this vulnerability. File integrity monitoring and intrusion detection systems provide valuable layers of defense for detecting and responding to attacks. The use of PSR-3 itself doesn't introduce this vulnerability; it's the *implementation* and *system configuration* that are critical.
