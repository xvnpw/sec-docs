# Deep Analysis: Bypass Log Sanitization/Filtering (Attack Tree Path)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   **Identify specific techniques** an attacker could use to bypass log sanitization and filtering mechanisms implemented in conjunction with the `php-fig/log` (PSR-3) logging interface.
*   **Assess the likelihood and impact** of each identified technique.
*   **Provide concrete recommendations** to mitigate the identified risks, focusing on secure coding practices and configuration best practices.
*   **Enhance the development team's understanding** of log sanitization bypass vulnerabilities.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path: **Bypass Log Sanitization/Filtering**.  It considers:

*   **The application's logging implementation:**  How the application uses `php-fig/log` (PSR-3).  This includes *which* logger implementation is used (e.g., Monolog, Analog, etc.), how log levels are used, and where log messages originate.  We *assume* a logger implementation is in use; PSR-3 is just an interface.
*   **The sanitization/filtering mechanisms:**  What specific methods are used to sanitize or filter log data *before* it's passed to the logger.  This is crucial, as `php-fig/log` itself does *not* provide sanitization.  Sanitization is the responsibility of the application *or* a logging handler (like those provided by Monolog).
*   **The context of log messages:**  Where the data being logged originates (user input, database queries, internal application state, etc.).
*   **The intended purpose of logging:**  What information is being logged and why (debugging, auditing, security monitoring, etc.).
*   **The storage and processing of logs:** Where the logs are stored (file system, database, cloud service) and how they are processed (log analysis tools, SIEM systems).

This analysis does *not* cover:

*   Attacks against the logging infrastructure itself (e.g., compromising the log server).
*   Attacks that don't involve bypassing sanitization (e.g., simply flooding the logs with irrelevant data).
*   General application security vulnerabilities unrelated to logging.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attacker goals related to bypassing log sanitization.
2.  **Technique Enumeration:**  List specific techniques attackers could use, drawing from common attack patterns and known vulnerabilities.
3.  **Implementation Review (Hypothetical):**  Since we don't have the specific application code, we'll create *hypothetical* code examples demonstrating vulnerable and secure implementations.  This is crucial for illustrating the concepts.
4.  **Likelihood and Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each technique, considering the application's context.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Provide specific, actionable recommendations to prevent or mitigate each technique.
6.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document the findings and recommendations in this report.

## 2. Deep Analysis of "Bypass Log Sanitization/Filtering"

### 2.1 Threat Modeling

An attacker might want to bypass log sanitization/filtering to achieve the following:

*   **Log Injection:** Inject malicious data into log files, potentially leading to:
    *   **Log Forgery:**  Creating false log entries to cover their tracks or frame others.
    *   **Code Injection (Indirect):**  If log files are later processed by vulnerable scripts (e.g., a poorly written log analyzer), injected code might be executed.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Indirect):**  If log files are accessible to unauthorized users, sensitive information might be leaked.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Injecting extremely large or complex data to consume disk space or overwhelm log processing systems.
    *   **XSS/HTML Injection (Indirect):** If logs are displayed in a web interface without proper escaping, injected HTML/JavaScript could be executed in the browser of an administrator viewing the logs.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Bypass filters to log sensitive data that should have been redacted (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal information).
*   **Evasion of Detection:**  Prevent security-relevant events from being logged, making it harder to detect and respond to attacks.

### 2.2 Technique Enumeration

Here are some specific techniques an attacker might use to bypass log sanitization/filtering:

1.  **Character Encoding Attacks:**
    *   **Description:**  Using alternative character encodings (e.g., UTF-16, UTF-7, double URL encoding) to bypass filters that only check for specific characters or patterns in a single encoding (usually UTF-8).
    *   **Example (Hypothetical Vulnerable Code):**
        ```php
        function sanitizeLogMessage($message) {
            // INSECURE: Only replaces single quotes.
            return str_replace("'", "", $message);
        }

        $logger->info(sanitizeLogMessage($_GET['userInput'])); // Vulnerable if userInput contains UTF-16 encoded single quote.
        ```
    *   **Likelihood:** High, if sanitization is naive and doesn't handle multiple encodings.
    *   **Impact:** High, can lead to log injection and potentially code execution.

2.  **Null Byte Injection:**
    *   **Description:**  Injecting a null byte (`%00`) to truncate the log message prematurely, potentially bypassing filters that operate on the entire string.  This is less common in PHP than in languages like C, but still possible in certain contexts.
    *   **Example (Hypothetical Vulnerable Code):**
        ```php
        function sanitizeLogMessage($message) {
            // INSECURE:  Checks for "evil" at the beginning, but null byte can bypass.
            if (strpos($message, "evil") === 0) {
                return "[REDACTED]";
            }
            return $message;
        }

        $logger->info(sanitizeLogMessage("evil\x00This is actually good data")); // Logs "evil"
        ```
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, depends on how the logging system and underlying libraries handle null bytes.
    *   **Impact:** Medium, can lead to incomplete log entries and potentially bypass security checks.

3.  **Unicode Normalization Issues:**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting differences in Unicode normalization forms (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD) to bypass filters that only check for one specific form.  For example, a filter might block the character "é" (U+00E9), but not the decomposed form "e" + "´" (U+0065 U+0301).
    *   **Example (Hypothetical Vulnerable Code):**
        ```php
        function sanitizeLogMessage($message) {
            // INSECURE: Only checks for the composed form of "é".
            return str_replace("é", "e", $message);
        }

        $logger->info(sanitizeLogMessage("e\u{0301}vil")); // Logs "évil"
        ```
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium, requires understanding of Unicode normalization.
    *   **Impact:** Medium, can lead to log injection.

4.  **Log Format String Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:**  If the application uses user-supplied input *directly* within the log message format string (similar to `printf` vulnerabilities), an attacker could inject format specifiers to potentially read or write arbitrary memory locations.  This is *highly unlikely* with PSR-3, as it encourages structured logging.
    *   **Example (Hypothetical Vulnerable Code - *Highly Unlikely with PSR-3*):**
        ```php
        // HIGHLY INSECURE AND UNLIKELY WITH PSR-3
        $logger->info(sprintf("User input: %s", $_GET['userInput']));
        ```
        This is bad practice *regardless* of logging.  PSR-3 encourages:
        ```php
        $logger->info("User input: {userInput}", ['userInput' => $_GET['userInput']]); // Much safer!
        ```
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (with proper PSR-3 usage).  High if the application misuses string formatting functions.
    *   **Impact:** Extremely High (if exploitable), can lead to arbitrary code execution.

5.  **Context-Specific Bypass:**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting the specific logic of the sanitization/filtering function.  This could involve finding edge cases, regular expression flaws, or other logic errors.
    *   **Example (Hypothetical Vulnerable Code):**
        ```php
        function sanitizeLogMessage($message) {
            // INSECURE:  Only removes the word "password".
            return str_replace("password", "[REDACTED]", $message);
        }

        $logger->info(sanitizeLogMessage("The user's passsword is secret.")); // Logs the sensitive information.
        ```
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High, depends on the complexity and correctness of the sanitization function.
    *   **Impact:** Variable, depends on the type of data being logged and the specific bypass.

6.  **Bypassing Regular Expression Filters:**
    *   **Description:**  Crafting input that matches the *intent* of a regular expression filter but still contains malicious content.  This often involves using complex regular expression features or exploiting ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example (Hypothetical Vulnerable Code):**
        ```php
        function sanitizeLogMessage($message) {
            // INSECURE: Tries to remove HTML tags, but is flawed.
            return preg_replace("/<[^>]+>/", "", $message);
        }

        $logger->info(sanitizeLogMessage("<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>")); // Might still execute JavaScript in a log viewer.
        ```
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High, regular expressions can be tricky to get right.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High, can lead to XSS or other injection attacks.

7.  **Leveraging Logging Handler Vulnerabilities:**
    *  **Description:** If using a vulnerable logging handler (e.g., a custom Monolog handler), the attacker might be able to bypass sanitization implemented *within* the handler. This is less about bypassing application-level sanitization and more about exploiting a flaw in the logging library itself.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the specific handler and its security posture).
    * **Impact:** Variable, depends on the vulnerability.

### 2.3 Mitigation Recommendations

1.  **Use Structured Logging (Always):**  Adhere strictly to the PSR-3 recommendation of using context arrays:
    ```php
    $logger->info("User {username} logged in from IP {ip}.", [
        'username' => $username,
        'ip' => $ip,
    ]);
    ```
    This avoids format string vulnerabilities and makes sanitization easier.

2.  **Sanitize *Before* Logging:**  Sanitize data *before* passing it to the logger, ideally as close to the source of the data as possible (e.g., immediately after receiving user input).

3.  **Use a Robust Sanitization Library:**  Don't roll your own sanitization functions.  Use a well-tested and maintained library like:
    *   **HTML Purifier:**  For sanitizing HTML input.
    *   **OWASP ESAPI (PHP port):**  Provides a comprehensive set of security controls, including output encoding and validation.
    *   **Respect/Validation:** For validating data types and formats.

4.  **Encode, Don't Just Filter:**  Instead of simply removing dangerous characters, *encode* them appropriately for the context.  For example, use `htmlspecialchars()` to encode HTML entities before displaying log data in a web interface.

5.  **Handle Unicode Properly:**
    *   Use Unicode-aware functions (e.g., `mb_*` functions in PHP) for string manipulation.
    *   Normalize strings to a consistent Unicode normalization form (e.g., NFC) *before* applying filters.
    *   Consider using a library that handles Unicode normalization and encoding correctly.

6.  **Avoid Null Bytes:**  Validate and sanitize input to remove or reject null bytes.

7.  **Regular Expression Best Practices:**
    *   Keep regular expressions as simple as possible.
    *   Test regular expressions thoroughly, including edge cases and potentially malicious input.
    *   Use a regular expression tester with ReDoS detection capabilities.
    *   Consider using a dedicated library for parsing complex formats (e.g., an HTML parser instead of regular expressions).

8.  **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the process writing logs has the minimum necessary permissions.  It should not have write access to other parts of the system.

9.  **Log Rotation and Retention:**  Implement log rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.  Define a clear log retention policy to limit the amount of time log data is stored.

10. **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including those related to logging.

11. **Keep Logging Libraries Updated:** Regularly update the logging library (e.g., Monolog) and any handlers to the latest versions to patch any security vulnerabilities.

12. **Monitor Logs:** Actively monitor logs for suspicious activity, including attempts to bypass sanitization or inject malicious data.

13. **Contextual Logging:** Log sufficient context to understand the event, but avoid logging sensitive data unnecessarily.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of attackers bypassing log sanitization and filtering, protecting the integrity and confidentiality of log data and improving the overall security of the application.
