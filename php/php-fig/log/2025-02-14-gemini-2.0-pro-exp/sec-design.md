# Project Design Document: PSR-3 Logger Interface

## BUSINESS POSTURE

*   Priorities:
    *   Provide a standardized logging interface for PHP libraries and frameworks.
    *   Promote interoperability between different logging implementations.
    *   Enable developers to easily switch between different loggers without modifying their code.
    *   Facilitate consistent logging practices across the PHP ecosystem.

*   Goals:
    *   Define a common interface for logging messages.
    *   Specify log levels and their intended usage.
    *   Allow for contextual data to be included with log messages.
    *   Ensure the interface is simple, flexible, and easy to implement.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Inconsistent logging practices across different libraries and frameworks, making it difficult to aggregate and analyze logs.
    *   Tight coupling between application code and specific logging implementations, hindering flexibility and maintainability.
    *   Lack of a standardized way to handle contextual data in log messages, leading to incomplete or inconsistent log information.
    *   Adoption failure: If the standard is not widely adopted, the benefits of interoperability will not be realized.

## SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: The PSR-3 standard itself does not directly implement security controls. It is an interface definition. Security is the responsibility of the implementing libraries. (Described in the PSR-3 specification).
    *   security control: Implementations should avoid logging sensitive data directly. (Implicit in good logging practices, but not explicitly enforced by the interface).
    *   security control: Implementations should consider the security of the underlying transport and storage mechanisms used for logging. (Responsibility of the implementation).

*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: The PSR-3 interface does not mandate specific security mechanisms, relying on implementations to handle security appropriately.
    *   accepted risk: The interface does not specify how to handle sensitive data, leaving this to the discretion of developers and implementers.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Implementations SHOULD provide mechanisms for sanitizing or redacting sensitive data from log messages (e.g., using placeholders or filtering).
    *   security control: Implementations SHOULD offer options for secure transport and storage of log data (e.g., encryption, access control).
    *   security control: Implementations SHOULD follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
    *   security control: Implementations SHOULD clearly document their security considerations and recommendations.

*   Security Requirements:

    *   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the logging interface itself. Authentication is relevant to the systems that consume or manage the logs.
    *   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the logging interface. Authorization is relevant to accessing and managing log data.
    *   Input Validation: Implementations MUST ensure that contextual data passed to the logger does not introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., injection attacks). Context data should be treated as untrusted input.
    *   Cryptography: Implementations SHOULD provide options for encrypting log data at rest and in transit, especially when dealing with sensitive information.

### BUILD

*   The PSR-3 interface itself is a specification and does not have a build process. However, implementations of the interface (e.g., Monolog, Log4php) will have their own build processes.  Since PSR-3 is an *interface*, the build process is more relevant to concrete *implementations* of that interface.  We'll describe a generalized build process for a typical PSR-3 compliant logging library.

    C --> E("Unit Tests");
    C --> F("Code Style Checker (e.g., PHP_CodeSniffer)");
