# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for php-fig/container

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Container Configuration - Principle of Least Privilege](./mitigation_strategies/secure_container_configuration_-_principle_of_least_privilege.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all container configuration files (e.g., YAML, PHP arrays) and ensure they are stored outside the webroot if possible.
    *   Step 2: Implement strict file system permissions. Only the web server user (for reading) and authorized deployment processes (for writing) should have access to configuration files.
    *   Step 3: For environment variables used in container configuration, ensure they are set and managed securely by the server environment, not exposed in publicly accessible files.
    *   Step 4: Regularly audit and maintain these permissions to prevent unauthorized access or modification of container configuration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification (High Severity):** Attackers gaining write access could inject malicious service definitions, alter existing services, or disable security features *within the container*, leading to application compromise.
        *   **Information Disclosure from Configuration (Medium Severity):** Unauthorized read access could expose sensitive information *present in container configuration*, such as database credentials or internal service mappings, if not properly secured.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification: High Reduction:** Significantly reduces the risk of malicious container configuration changes by limiting access control.
        *   **Information Disclosure from Configuration: Medium Reduction:** Reduces the risk of accidental exposure of sensitive data *within container configuration* by restricting access.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Production and staging environments use file permissions to restrict access to `config/services.yaml`. Environment variables are used, but their access control might not be as strictly enforced as file permissions.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Enforce stricter permissions for all configuration files and environment variable configurations across all environments (including development). Document and automate permission setting as part of deployment processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Container Configuration Data](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_container_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all external sources that influence container configuration (e.g., environment variables, external configuration files loaded at runtime).
    *   Step 2: Define strict validation rules for all external configuration data used by the container, based on expected data types, formats, and allowed values.
    *   Step 3: Implement input validation logic *before* using external data to configure the container. This should happen during the container building or configuration loading phase.
    *   Step 4: Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using it in container configuration, especially if used to construct file paths or class names dynamically *within container definitions*.
    *   Step 5: Log any invalid input attempts during container configuration for security monitoring.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Configuration Injection (High Severity):** Attackers could manipulate external input to inject malicious configuration values, leading to arbitrary service instantiation or modification *within the container*, potentially causing code execution or denial of service.
        *   **Path Traversal in Configuration Loading (Medium Severity):** If configuration data is used to construct file paths for loading configuration files or services *by the container*, attackers could use path traversal to load arbitrary files.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Configuration Injection: High Reduction:**  Significantly reduces the risk of malicious configuration injection by validating and sanitizing external input used by the container.
        *   **Path Traversal in Configuration Loading: Medium Reduction:** Reduces the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities during container configuration loading by validating file paths.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Basic validation might exist for some environment variables used for core settings. More complex or dynamic configuration scenarios might lack robust input validation.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implement comprehensive input validation for all external configuration sources used by the container. Develop validation schemas and integrate them into the container configuration loading process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Hardcoding Secrets in Container Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_hardcoding_secrets_in_container_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Audit all container configuration files (YAML, PHP, environment variables) for hardcoded secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.) that are used *within container definitions or service parameters*.
    *   Step 2: Replace hardcoded secrets with references to secure secret management solutions (environment variables managed by the environment, dedicated secret vaults).
    *   Step 3: Configure the application and container to retrieve secrets from the chosen secret management solution *during container building or service instantiation*.
    *   Step 4: Ensure proper access control and auditing for the secret management solution itself.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Credential Exposure in Container Configuration (High Severity):** Hardcoded secrets in container configuration are easily exposed if configuration files are compromised. This can lead to unauthorized access to dependent systems or services.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Credential Exposure in Container Configuration: High Reduction:** Significantly reduces the risk of secret exposure by removing them from container configuration and using secure secret management.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Database passwords might be sourced from environment variables. Other secrets used in container configuration might still be hardcoded, especially in non-production environments.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Fully migrate all secrets used in container configuration to a dedicated secret management solution. Implement automated secret retrieval during container setup.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Define Service Interfaces and Types for Container Injection](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_define_service_interfaces_and_types_for_container_injection.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define clear interfaces for services managed by the container, specifying expected methods and properties.
    *   Step 2: Implement services to adhere strictly to these interfaces.
    *   Step 3: Utilize type hints (in PHP) in service definitions and constructor/method injections *within the container configuration* to enforce expected dependency types.
    *   Step 4: Leverage static analysis tools to enforce type hints and interface adherence in service definitions and injection points *related to the container*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unexpected Service Injection (Medium Severity):** Without strict type definitions, attackers might try to inject unexpected or malicious objects as dependencies *through the container*, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior or vulnerabilities.
        *   **Type Confusion Vulnerabilities in Service Resolution (Medium Severity):** Lack of type enforcement in container injection can lead to type confusion issues during service resolution, potentially causing security flaws.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unexpected Service Injection: Medium Reduction:** Reduces the risk of malicious service injection by enforcing type contracts during container dependency resolution.
        *   **Type Confusion Vulnerabilities in Service Resolution: Medium Reduction:** Reduces the risk of type confusion issues during container operations by promoting type safety.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Interfaces are used for some services, and type hints are used in some constructor injections. Consistency and coverage might be lacking across all services managed by the container.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Enforce interface-based design and type hinting consistently for all services managed by the container. Integrate static analysis to verify type safety in container configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Updates for Container Library](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_updates_for_container_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly monitor for security advisories related to the `php-fig/container` interface implementation being used and any underlying container libraries.
    *   Step 2: Keep the container library and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and versions.
    *   Step 3: Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in the container library and its dependencies.
    *   Step 4: Integrate dependency updates and vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure timely patching.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Container Library (High to Critical Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in the `php-fig/container` implementation or its dependencies could be directly exploited to compromise the application. Severity depends on the specific vulnerability.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Container Library: High Reduction:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in the container library by keeping it updated and proactively identifying issues.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Dependency updates are generally performed, but dedicated security monitoring and automated dependency scanning for the container library might not be consistently in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implement automated dependency scanning specifically targeting the container library and its dependencies. Set up alerts for security advisories related to the container library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling and Logging for Container Operations](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling_and_logging_for_container_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement robust error handling for container operations such as service resolution failures, configuration parsing errors, and injection exceptions.
    *   Step 2: Avoid exposing sensitive information in container-related error messages (e.g., internal paths, configuration details).
    *   Step 3: Log relevant container events, including configuration changes, service resolution errors, and security-related issues encountered during container operations.
    *   Step 4: Monitor container logs for unusual activity or error patterns that might indicate security issues or misconfigurations related to the container.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via Container Errors (Low to Medium Severity):** Verbose error messages from the container could inadvertently expose sensitive information about the application's internal structure or configuration.
        *   **Detection of Container-Related Attacks (Medium Severity):** Proper logging of container events can aid in detecting and responding to attacks that target the container or exploit misconfigurations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via Container Errors: Low Reduction:** Reduces the risk of information leakage through error messages by implementing proper error handling and sanitization.
        *   **Detection of Container-Related Attacks: Medium Reduction:** Improves security monitoring and incident response capabilities by providing logs of container operations.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic error handling and logging are likely in place. However, the level of detail and security focus in container-specific error handling and logging might vary.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Review and enhance error handling and logging specifically for container operations. Ensure error messages are sanitized and logs are comprehensive enough for security monitoring without being overly verbose with sensitive details.
