### 2. Deep Analysis of Insecure Factory Function Implementation leading to Object Injection

#### 2.1 Detailed Explanation of the Threat

The `php-fig/container` interface allows for the definition of services using factory functions. These functions are closures or callable classes that are responsible for creating and configuring service objects when they are requested from the container. This dynamic instantiation is powerful but introduces security risks if not handled carefully.

The core vulnerability arises when a factory function uses **untrusted input** to make decisions about:

*   **Class Instantiation:**  Dynamically determining which class to instantiate based on input. For example, using user-provided class names.
*   **Constructor Arguments:**  Passing untrusted input directly as constructor arguments to the instantiated class.
*   **Method Calls and Property Setting:**  Using untrusted input to decide which methods to call on the instantiated object or which properties to set, and what values to use.

If an attacker can control this untrusted input, they can manipulate the factory function to instantiate objects of their choosing, potentially classes that were not intended to be part of the application's service graph. This is **Object Injection**.

**How it works in `php-fig/container` context:**

Imagine a factory function within your container definition that is designed to create different types of loggers based on a configuration parameter.  If this configuration parameter comes from an untrusted source (e.g., a GET parameter) and is not properly validated, an attacker could inject a malicious class name as the logger type.

```php
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;

$container = new class() implements ContainerInterface { // Example container implementation
    private $services = [];

    public function get(string $id) {
        if (isset($this->services[$id])) {
            return $this->services[$id]($this); // Execute factory
        }
        throw new NotFoundException("Service not found: " . $id);
    }

    public function has(string $id): bool {
        return isset($this->services[$id]);
    }

    public function setFactory(string $id, callable $factory): void {
        $this->services[$id] = $factory;
    }
};

// Vulnerable factory function example:
$container->setFactory('logger', function (ContainerInterface $c) {
    $loggerType = $_GET['logger_type'] ?? 'DefaultLogger'; // Untrusted input!
    $className = 'App\\Logger\\' . $loggerType; // Dynamically building class name

    if (class_exists($className)) { // Basic check, but insufficient
        return new $className(); // Potential Object Injection!
    } else {
        return new App\Logger\DefaultLogger();
    }
});

// ... later in the application ...
$logger = $container->get('logger'); // Trigger factory function
$logger->log("Something happened.");
```

In this vulnerable example, an attacker could manipulate the `logger_type` GET parameter to inject a class name like `SystemCommandExecutor` (if such a class exists in the application or autoload path).  If `SystemCommandExecutor` is designed to execute system commands, the attacker has now gained control to instantiate and potentially use this class through the container.

#### 2.2 Attack Vectors

Common attack vectors for exploiting insecure factory functions include:

*   **HTTP Request Parameters (GET/POST):**  Directly using values from query parameters or form data to influence factory function logic. This is a very common and easily exploitable vector.
*   **Configuration Files (if externally modifiable):** If configuration files that define factory function behavior are writable by attackers (e.g., through file upload vulnerabilities or insecure permissions), they can be modified to inject malicious configurations.
*   **External APIs/Data Sources:**  If factory functions rely on data fetched from external APIs or databases without proper validation, and these external sources are compromised or manipulated, object injection can occur.
*   **Environment Variables (less common but possible):** In some scenarios, environment variables might be used to configure factory functions. If an attacker can control environment variables (e.g., in a shared hosting environment or through other vulnerabilities), this could be an attack vector.

#### 2.3 Exploitation Scenarios and Impact

The impact of object injection through insecure factory functions can be severe and multifaceted:

*   **Direct Object Injection:**  The attacker can instantiate arbitrary classes within the application's context. This itself might not be immediately exploitable, but it's a crucial first step.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Chaining:** Object injection becomes extremely dangerous when chained with other vulnerabilities. Common chaining scenarios include:
    *   **Magic Method Exploitation:** Injecting objects that have "magic methods" (like `__wakeup`, `__destruct`, `__toString`, `__call`) that are automatically triggered by PHP during object lifecycle events. If these magic methods contain vulnerabilities, the injected object can execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Injecting objects that are designed to trigger deserialization vulnerabilities when they are later serialized and unserialized by the application.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Injecting objects that can manipulate database queries or connections in unexpected ways, leading to SQL injection if the application later uses these objects in database interactions.
    *   **File System Access:** Injecting objects that can read, write, or delete files on the server, potentially leading to data breaches or denial of service.
*   **Data Manipulation and Corruption:** Injected objects can be designed to interact with application logic and data in malicious ways. This could involve:
    *   Modifying application state or business logic.
    *   Accessing or exfiltrating sensitive data.
    *   Corrupting data integrity.
    *   Bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injected objects could consume excessive resources (memory, CPU) or trigger infinite loops, leading to denial of service.

**Example RCE Chaining (Conceptual):**

Imagine a class `VulnerableLogger` with a `__destruct` method that executes a system command based on a property.

```php
namespace App\Logger;

class VulnerableLogger
{
    public $command;

    public function __destruct()
    {
        if (isset($this->command)) {
            system($this->command); // Vulnerable!
        }
    }

    public function log(string $message): void
    {
        echo "Logging: " . $message . "\n";
    }
}
```

Using the vulnerable factory function example from before, an attacker could inject this `VulnerableLogger` and set its `command` property:

```php
// Attacker crafted request:
// ?logger_type=VulnerableLogger&command=rm+-rf+/tmp/malicious_file.txt

$container->setFactory('logger', function (ContainerInterface $c) {
    $loggerType = $_GET['logger_type'] ?? 'DefaultLogger';
    $className = 'App\\Logger\\' . $loggerType;

    if (class_exists($className)) {
        $logger = new $className();
        if ($logger instanceof VulnerableLogger && isset($_GET['command'])) {
            $logger->command = $_GET['command']; // Setting property with untrusted input!
        }
        return $logger;
    } else {
        return new App\Logger\DefaultLogger();
    }
});

$logger = $container->get('logger'); // VulnerableLogger is instantiated and potentially property set
// ... application continues, and when $logger object is no longer needed, __destruct is called, executing the command.
```

This is a simplified example, but it illustrates how object injection can be chained to achieve RCE.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

To effectively mitigate the risk of object injection through insecure factory functions, implement the following strategies:

1.  **Avoid Using Untrusted Input Directly:**  The most crucial mitigation is to **never directly use untrusted input to determine class names, constructor arguments, or object properties within factory functions.**  Treat all external input (request parameters, configuration, external APIs) as potentially malicious.

2.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (if dynamic creation is unavoidable):** If dynamic object creation based on input is absolutely necessary, implement **rigorous input validation and sanitization**.
    *   **Validation:**  Verify that the input conforms to expected formats and values. For example, if expecting a logger type, validate against a predefined list of allowed logger types.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Cleanse or escape the input to remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters or sequences. However, sanitization alone is often insufficient for preventing object injection in this context. **Validation is paramount.**

3.  **Whitelist Approach for Class Instantiation:**  Instead of dynamically building class names based on input, use a **whitelist** of allowed classes. Map input values to specific, pre-approved classes.

    ```php
    $container->setFactory('logger', function (ContainerInterface $c) {
        $loggerType = $_GET['logger_type'] ?? 'default'; // Input from request

        $allowedLoggerTypes = [
            'default' => App\Logger\DefaultLogger::class,
            'file'    => App\Logger\FileLogger::class,
            'database' => App\Logger\DatabaseLogger::class,
        ];

        if (isset($allowedLoggerTypes[$loggerType])) {
            $className = $allowedLoggerTypes[$loggerType];
            return new $className();
        } else {
            // Log an error or throw an exception for invalid logger type
            error_log("Invalid logger type requested: " . $loggerType);
            return new App\Logger\DefaultLogger(); // Fallback to default
        }
    });
    ```

    This whitelist approach ensures that only classes explicitly defined in the `$allowedLoggerTypes` array can be instantiated, regardless of user input.

4.  **Parameterize Constructor Arguments and Method Calls:**  If you need to configure objects based on input, use parameterized constructor arguments or setter methods, but **ensure that the values passed are validated and sanitized *before* being used in the factory function.**  Avoid dynamically constructing code or class names based on input within these parameters.

5.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the classes instantiated by factory functions have the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid instantiating powerful or sensitive classes through factory functions that are exposed to untrusted input.

6.  **Regular Code Reviews and Security Audits:**  Thoroughly review and audit all factory function implementations for potential object injection vulnerabilities. Pay close attention to how input is handled and how object instantiation and configuration are performed. Use static analysis tools to help identify potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Consider Alternative Patterns:**  If dynamic service creation based on untrusted input is a significant security concern, consider alternative, more secure patterns.  For example:
    *   **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags to enable or disable features based on configuration, rather than dynamically instantiating different classes.
    *   **Strategy Pattern with Predefined Strategies:** Implement the Strategy pattern with a set of predefined strategy classes. Select the appropriate strategy based on validated input, without dynamically instantiating classes based on untrusted input.

#### 2.5 Example: Secure Factory Function Implementation

Here's an example of a more secure factory function using a whitelist approach:

```php
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;

$container->setFactory('secureLogger', function (ContainerInterface $c) {
    $loggerType = $_GET['logger_type'] ?? 'default'; // Input from request

    $allowedLoggerTypes = [
        'default' => App\Logger\DefaultLogger::class,
        'file'    => App\Logger\FileLogger::class,
        'database' => App\Logger\DatabaseLogger::class,
    ];

    if (!array_key_exists($loggerType, $allowedLoggerTypes)) {
        error_log("Invalid logger type requested: " . $loggerType);
        $loggerType = 'default'; // Fallback to default
    }

    $className = $allowedLoggerTypes[$loggerType];
    $logger = new $className();

    // Example of validating and sanitizing constructor arguments (if needed)
    if ($logger instanceof App\Logger\FileLogger) {
        $logFilePath = $_GET['log_file_path'] ?? '/tmp/app.log';
        // **Strictly validate and sanitize $logFilePath before using it!**
        $validatedPath = realpath(dirname(__FILE__)) . '/logs/' . basename($logFilePath); // Example of path validation
        $logger->setLogFile($validatedPath); // Set validated path
    }

    return $logger;
});
```

In this secure example:

*   A whitelist (`$allowedLoggerTypes`) is used to restrict the possible logger classes.
*   Input validation (`array_key_exists`) ensures only allowed types are used.
*   If constructor arguments are needed (like `log_file_path`), they are validated and sanitized before being used to configure the object.  The example uses `realpath` and `basename` for basic path validation, but more robust validation might be needed depending on the context.

### 3. Conclusion

Insecure factory function implementations in `php-fig/container` applications pose a significant object injection risk. By directly using untrusted input to control object instantiation and configuration, developers can inadvertently create pathways for attackers to inject malicious objects and potentially achieve remote code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service.

Adopting secure coding practices, particularly **avoiding direct use of untrusted input and implementing whitelist-based approaches**, is crucial for mitigating this threat. Regular code reviews, security audits, and considering alternative design patterns can further strengthen the security posture of applications utilizing `php-fig/container`. By understanding the mechanics of this vulnerability and diligently applying mitigation strategies, development teams can build more resilient and secure applications.
