# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project defines a standard interface (`ContainerInterface`) for dependency injection containers in PHP. The goal is to promote interoperability between PHP frameworks and libraries by providing a common way to interact with dependency injection containers. This standardization aims to reduce vendor lock-in, improve code reusability, and enhance the overall developer experience within the PHP ecosystem.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Primary goal: Establish a widely adopted standard interface for dependency injection containers in PHP.
- Secondary goal: Improve interoperability between PHP frameworks and libraries.
- Tertiary goal: Enhance developer experience and reduce framework lock-in within the PHP ecosystem.

Business Risks:
- Risk 1: Lack of adoption by the PHP community, rendering the specification ineffective.
- Risk 2: Security vulnerabilities introduced through implementations of the specification if not carefully considered.
- Risk 3: Ambiguity or flaws in the specification leading to inconsistent or insecure implementations.
- Risk 4: Performance issues arising from implementations of the specification.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Public repository on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the specification. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Open discussion and issue tracking on GitHub, enabling community feedback and identification of potential issues. Implemented in: GitHub repository issue tracker.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities might be present in initial versions of the specification, requiring iterative improvements.
- accepted risk: Implementations of the specification by third parties may introduce security vulnerabilities that are outside the scope of this project.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Formal security review of the specification by security experts to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for implementers of the `ContainerInterface` to mitigate common security risks in dependency injection.
- security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities found in the specification or its implementations.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the specification itself, but implementations using containers will need robust authentication mechanisms.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the specification itself, but implementations using containers will need robust authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and functionalities.
- Input Validation: Implementations using containers must perform thorough input validation to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities. This is indirectly related to the specification as containers are often used to manage components that handle user input.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the specification itself, but implementations using containers might need to utilize cryptography for secure data handling and communication. The specification should not hinder the use of cryptography in implementations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Process 1: Development and maintenance of the `ContainerInterface` specification. This is critical for achieving the goal of standardization and interoperability.
- Process 2: Adoption and implementation of the `ContainerInterface` by PHP frameworks and libraries. Widespread adoption is essential for the specification to be effective.

Data Sensitivity:
- Data 1: The specification document itself. Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are important. Modification by unauthorized parties or loss of access would be a risk.
- Data 2: Issue tracker discussions and community feedback. Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are important for the collaborative development process.
- Data 3: Source code of the `ContainerInterface`. Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity is crucial. Malicious modification could lead to vulnerabilities in implementations.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Q1: Is there a plan for formal security review of the specification by dedicated security experts?
- Q2: Are there specific guidelines or best practices being developed for implementers of the `ContainerInterface` to address security concerns in their container implementations?
- Q3: What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities found in the specification or its implementations?
- Q4: Is there a plan to provide reference implementations or security-focused examples to guide developers?

Assumptions:
- Assumption 1: The primary goal is to create a widely adopted and beneficial standard for the PHP community, with security being a significant but secondary consideration compared to functionality and interoperability.
- Assumption 2: Security responsibility for implementations of the `ContainerInterface` primarily rests with the developers and projects implementing the specification, not directly with the specification project itself.
- Assumption 3: The PHP-FIG community is committed to addressing security concerns and improving the specification iteratively based on feedback and identified vulnerabilities.
- Assumption 4: The GitHub platform provides a reasonably secure environment for hosting the specification and facilitating collaboration.
