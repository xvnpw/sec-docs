# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for php-fig/container

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Define Container Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_define_container_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Container Configuration Files:**  Locate and review all files where your `php-fig/container` compatible container is configured.
    2.  **Explicit Service Declarations:** Ensure that every service registered in the container is explicitly defined within your container configuration. Avoid relying on auto-discovery mechanisms that might be offered by specific container implementations if they are not strictly controlled and understood.
    3.  **Dependency Specification:** For each service definition, clearly and explicitly declare all its dependencies *within the container configuration*. This ensures the container is aware of and manages all service dependencies.
    4.  **Remove Unnecessary Services:**  Identify and remove any service definitions in your container configuration that are no longer used or are not essential for the application's functionality. A leaner container is a more secure container.
    5.  **Regular Configuration Audits:**  Periodically review the container configuration to ensure it remains minimal, secure, and aligned with the application's current needs. This includes auditing the service definitions themselves.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Service Instantiation (Medium Severity):** Attackers might be able to manipulate the application to trigger the container to instantiate internal or sensitive services that were not intended to be publicly accessible or used in certain contexts due to overly permissive or unclear container definitions.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** A container with overly broad or vague definitions increases the attack surface by potentially exposing more services than necessary through the dependency injection mechanism.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Service Instantiation: High Reduction:** Explicitly defining services and their dependencies in the container configuration directly limits what the container can resolve, significantly reducing the risk of unintended instantiation.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface: Medium Reduction:** By minimizing and explicitly defining services within the container, the attack surface directly related to the container's scope is reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, partially implemented in `config/dependencies.php`. Service definitions are generally explicit for core application services and infrastructure components within the container configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  While core services are explicit, review if any parts of the container configuration rely on implicit registrations or broad patterns. Ensure all service definitions are consciously and explicitly added to the container configuration. Regular audits of the container configuration itself are not yet formally scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Container Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_container_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Service Visibility Review:** For each service defined in your `php-fig/container` compatible container, determine its intended scope and visibility *within the context of dependency injection*. Is it meant to be widely injectable or restricted?
    2.  **Restrict Public Accessibility (Configuration Level):**  If the chosen container implementation allows for visibility control *within its configuration* (e.g., private services, scopes), utilize these features to restrict the injectability of services that should be internal.
    3.  **Minimize Service Scope (Configuration Level):**  Define services with the narrowest possible scope *within the container configuration*. If a service is only needed in a specific module, consider if the container configuration can reflect this limited scope.
    4.  **Access Control Mechanisms (Container Aware):** If the container or application framework provides access control mechanisms that are *aware of the dependency injection container* (e.g., policies that check service access), implement them to restrict access to sensitive services based on context or roles *as managed by or understood by the container*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Services (High Severity):** Attackers could potentially leverage the dependency injection mechanism to gain access to sensitive services (e.g., database connections, security components) if the container configuration doesn't enforce least privilege and allows unintended injection points.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** If internal services are easily injectable through the container, attackers who have compromised a less privileged part of the application might be able to use the container to access more critical internal components via dependency injection, facilitating lateral movement.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Services: High Reduction:**  Restricting service visibility and implementing container-aware access control within the container configuration directly limits unauthorized injection, significantly reducing the risk.
    *   **Lateral Movement: Medium Reduction:**  By making internal services less easily injectable through the container configuration, the effort required for lateral movement via dependency injection is increased.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Implicit scoping might exist due to module structure, but explicit visibility control *within the container configuration itself* is not consistently applied. Container-aware access control mechanisms are not currently in use.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Investigate if the chosen container implementation supports explicit service visibility control *in its configuration*. If so, implement this for internal services. Explore integrating container-aware access control policies to further restrict injection of sensitive services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Container Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/validate_container_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schema Definition (Container Configuration):** If possible, define a schema or structure for your container configuration files. This schema should describe the expected format and rules for service definitions within the container.
    2.  **Automated Validation (Container Configuration):** Implement automated validation processes that specifically check the container configuration against the defined schema or a set of predefined rules *for container configurations*. This validation should be performed during application startup or build processes.
    3.  **Rule-Based Validation (Container Specific):**  Define validation rules specifically relevant to container configurations, such as:
        *   Circular dependencies *detected by the container*.
        *   Missing dependencies *as defined in the container*.
        *   Incorrect service types or parameter types *as configured in the container*.
        *   Invalid service names or identifiers *within the container configuration*.
    4.  **Error Reporting and Handling (Container Focused):** Ensure that validation errors *related to the container configuration* are reported clearly and prevent the application from starting with an invalid container setup.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration Errors Leading to Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):**  Invalid container configurations can lead to unexpected application behavior specifically due to miswired dependencies managed by the container, including crashes or incorrect functionality.
    *   **Denial of Service (Low to Medium Severity):** In severe cases, container configuration errors, such as circular dependencies, could lead to application startup failures that can be exploited to cause a denial of service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Errors Leading to Unexpected Behavior: High Reduction:**  Automated validation of the container configuration directly reduces the risk of errors arising from misconfigurations within the container itself.
    *   **Denial of Service: Low to Medium Reduction:** Validation can prevent some DoS scenarios caused by container configuration errors, specifically those related to container startup issues.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No.  Currently, container configuration validation is primarily done through manual code reviews and testing. There is no automated validation process specifically for the container configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement automated validation of the container configuration. This could involve creating a schema for the configuration and using a validation library or writing custom validation scripts focused on container-specific rules. Integrate this validation into the build process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Default Configurations (Related to Container)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_default_configurations__related_to_container_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Container Implementation Defaults:** Examine the default settings and configurations of the *specific `php-fig/container` compatible container implementation* you are using.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Container Defaults:** Identify any default settings *of the container implementation itself* that could potentially introduce security risks. Examples might include default service instantiation behaviors or default error handling related to service resolution.
    3.  **Override Insecure Container Defaults:**  Explicitly override any insecure default settings *of the container implementation* with more secure and restrictive configurations in your application's container setup.
    4.  **Document Secure Container Defaults:** Document the secure default configurations *specifically related to the container implementation* that are implemented and the reasoning behind them.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):** Insecure default settings *of the container implementation*, such as overly verbose error messages during service resolution, could lead to information disclosure.
    *   **Unnecessary Functionality Enabled (Low Severity):** Default settings *of the container implementation* might enable functionalities that are not needed and could potentially be exploited in the context of dependency injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure: Medium Reduction:**  Overriding insecure defaults *of the container implementation* reduces the risk of information disclosure through container-related default behaviors.
    *   **Unnecessary Functionality Enabled: Low Reduction:**  Securing container defaults helps minimize risks from potentially exploitable container features that are not needed.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Application-specific defaults are configured, but a systematic review of *container implementation specific* default settings for security implications has not been performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a comprehensive review of default settings for the chosen `php-fig/container` compatible implementation. Document and implement secure overrides for any identified insecure defaults *of the container itself*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Container Access](./mitigation_strategies/limit_container_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Necessary Container Access Points:**  Analyze your application code to identify all locations where the *`php-fig/container` compatible container object* is directly accessed.
    2.  **Minimize Direct Container Usage:**  Refactor code to minimize direct access to the container object. Favor dependency injection through constructor or setter injection *as the primary way to obtain services*, instead of directly retrieving services from the container object within application logic.
    3.  **Restrict Container Object Exposure:**  Limit the scope and visibility of the *container object itself*. Avoid passing the container object around unnecessarily or making it globally accessible, as this increases the potential for misuse of the container API.
    4.  **Abstraction Layers (for Container Access):**  Introduce abstraction layers or service locators *if absolutely needed* to provide controlled and limited access to services without directly exposing the full container object and its API everywhere.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misuse of Container Capabilities (Medium Severity):**  Unrestricted access to the container object can lead to misuse of its capabilities, such as bypassing intended dependency injection patterns, resolving services in unintended contexts directly via the container, or potentially manipulating the container's state if the implementation allows it.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Low to Medium Severity):**  Widespread access to the container object increases the potential attack surface by providing more points in the code where attackers could try to interact with the container API in unexpected or malicious ways.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misuse of Container Capabilities: Medium Reduction:**  Limiting container access reduces the risk of misuse of the container API by restricting the ability to directly interact with it from various parts of the application.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface: Low to Medium Reduction:**  By reducing the exposure of the container object, the attack surface related to direct container API manipulation is decreased.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency injection is widely used. Direct container access is mostly limited to bootstrap and specific factory classes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a code audit to identify and further reduce instances of direct container access. Reinforce the pattern of relying on constructor/setter injection.  Evaluate if a service locator abstraction is beneficial to further control and limit direct container object usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Container-Related Inputs (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_container-related_inputs__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Container Input Points:**  Determine if your application takes any external input that *directly influences the behavior of the `php-fig/container` compatible container*. This could include service names, parameter values, or configuration paths provided through user input that are then used to interact with the container.
    2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Container Context):**  For any identified input points that affect the container, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization. Validate data types, formats, allowed values, and sanitize input to prevent injection attacks *targeting the container*.
    3.  **Whitelist Allowed Inputs (Container Specific):**  Where possible, use whitelisting to define a set of allowed values for container-related inputs, such as allowed service names if dynamic resolution is used (though discouraged). Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    4.  **Error Handling for Invalid Input (Container Focused):**  Implement proper error handling for invalid input *related to container operations*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Injection Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** If user-controlled input is used to determine service names or parameters *passed to the container*, attackers could potentially craft malicious input to inject unintended services, manipulate service behavior *via the container*, or gain access to sensitive components through the dependency injection mechanism.
    *   **Configuration Injection (Medium Severity):** If configuration files or paths *used by the container* are influenced by user input, attackers might be able to inject malicious configuration data, potentially altering container behavior or introducing vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Container Injection Attacks: High Reduction:**  Input validation and sanitization are crucial for preventing container injection attacks by ensuring that only valid and expected input is used when interacting with the container based on external data.
    *   **Configuration Injection: Medium Reduction:**  Input validation helps mitigate configuration injection risks related to container configuration loading if user input influences this process.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No.  Currently, there are no known direct user inputs that are used to *directly influence container behavior* in the application. Configuration files are loaded from disk, and paths are indirectly influenced by environment variables, but not directly by user input.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Review configuration loading mechanisms to ensure that file paths or configuration values *used by the container* are not directly or indirectly influenced by untrusted user input. Implement input validation if any user-controlled input is identified that could potentially influence container behavior in the future.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic Service Resolution Based on Untrusted Input](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic_service_resolution_based_on_untrusted_input.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Resolution Points:**  Locate any code sections where service resolution *via the `php-fig/container` compatible container* is performed dynamically based on user-provided input (e.g., using variable service names derived from requests to resolve services).
    2.  **Eliminate Dynamic Resolution (Container Context):**  Refactor code to avoid dynamic service resolution based on untrusted input *through the container*. Favor static service resolution where service dependencies are known at configuration time and resolved through standard dependency injection.
    3.  **Strict Validation for Necessary Dynamic Resolution (Container):** If dynamic service resolution based on user input *via the container* is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict validation and sanitization of the input used to determine the service name or identifier. Use whitelisting to allow only a predefined set of valid, safe service names.
    4.  **Consider Alternative Patterns (No Dynamic Container Resolution):** Explore alternative design patterns that can achieve the desired functionality without relying on dynamic service resolution based on untrusted input *through the container*, such as strategy pattern, factory pattern, or command pattern with predefined handlers that are statically injected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Container Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Dynamic service resolution based on untrusted input *via the container* is a primary vector for container injection attacks. Attackers can manipulate the input to resolve and instantiate unintended services through the container, potentially leading to code execution or data breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Container Injection Attacks: High Reduction:**  Avoiding dynamic service resolution based on untrusted input *through the container* is a highly effective mitigation strategy for preventing container injection attacks. It eliminates the primary attack vector related to the container's service resolution mechanism.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, largely implemented. Dynamic service resolution based on user input *via the container* is generally avoided in the application architecture. Service resolution is primarily based on static configurations and standard dependency injection.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Perform a code audit to explicitly confirm that there are no instances of dynamic service resolution based on untrusted input *using the container*. If any such instances are found, refactor the code to eliminate dynamic resolution or implement extremely strict validation as described above.
