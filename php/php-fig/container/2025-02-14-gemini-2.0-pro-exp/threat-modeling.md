# Threat Model Analysis for php-fig/container

## Threat: [Service Definition Overwrite](./threats/service_definition_overwrite.md)

*   **1. Threat: Service Definition Overwrite**

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., insecure file permissions, configuration injection) to overwrite the definition of an existing service within the container's configuration. They replace the class name associated with a service ID with a malicious class they control. This is achieved by modifying a configuration file, manipulating environment variables used by the container, or exploiting a vulnerability in the configuration loading mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** When the application requests the compromised service, the attacker's malicious code is executed instead of the intended service. This leads to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Container configuration (e.g., XML file, YAML file, PHP array, database entries), Configuration loading mechanism (e.g., `ConfigProvider`, file parsing functions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a.** Strictly control file permissions on configuration files. Only the web server user (and ideally, a restricted user within that) should have read access. No write access should be granted to the web server user for production configurations.
        *   **b.** Use a secure configuration loading mechanism that validates the integrity of the configuration data (e.g., checksums, digital signatures).
        *   **c.** Treat container configuration as code: use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   **d.** Implement input validation and sanitization if any part of the container configuration is derived from user input or external sources.
        *   **e.** Consider using immutable configuration in production (e.g., a compiled container configuration that cannot be modified at runtime).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Service Injection (Runtime)](./threats/unauthorized_service_injection__runtime_.md)

*   **2. Threat: Unauthorized Service Injection (Runtime)**

    *   **Description:** If the container implementation allows for runtime modification (adding or replacing services after the container is built), an attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., a code injection flaw) to inject a new, malicious service definition into the running container.
    *   **Impact:** This leads to the execution of the attacker's malicious code when the injected service is requested, resulting in arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Container's `set()` method (or equivalent, if the implementation provides one for runtime modification), any API or interface that allows modifying the container after initialization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if runtime modification is enabled)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a.** *Preferably*, disable runtime modification of the container in production environments. This is the most secure approach.
        *   **b.** If runtime modification is *absolutely required*, implement strict authentication and authorization checks before allowing any modifications to the container. Only trusted code/users should be able to modify the container.
        *   **c.** Log all runtime modifications to the container, including the source of the modification, the changes made, and timestamps.
        *   **d.** Implement input validation and sanitization for any data used in runtime service definitions.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion (Supply Chain Attack) - *Container Configuration Aspect*](./threats/dependency_confusion__supply_chain_attack__-_container_configuration_aspect.md)

*   **3. Threat: Dependency Confusion (Supply Chain Attack) - *Container Configuration Aspect***

    *   **Description:** While primarily a dependency management issue, the *container configuration* can be a factor. If the container configuration specifies package sources or influences how dependencies are resolved, a misconfiguration could lead the container to use a malicious package from a public repository instead of the intended private source.  This is especially relevant if the container itself is responsible for fetching or configuring dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker's malicious code is executed when the compromised dependency is used, leading to potential code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Container configuration (if it specifies package sources or influences dependency resolution), `get()` method (when resolving the compromised dependency).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a.** Explicitly configure the container (if applicable) to use the correct package sources. Avoid relying on default configurations that might prioritize public repositories.
        *   **b.** If the container configuration influences dependency resolution, ensure it's securely managed and validated.
        *   **c.** Use a private package repository for internal dependencies.
        *   **d.** Use package signing and verification.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Configuration](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_configuration.md)

*   **4. Threat: Sensitive Data Exposure in Configuration**

    *   **Description:** The container's configuration file (or other configuration source) contains sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) in plain text. An attacker gains access to this configuration file through a vulnerability (e.g., directory traversal, file inclusion, misconfigured web server).
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains access to sensitive credentials, allowing them to access databases, external services, or other resources, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Container configuration files (e.g., XML, YAML, PHP), Environment variables (if used for configuration *and* exposed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **a.** *Never* store sensitive data directly in configuration files.
        *   **b.** Use environment variables to store sensitive data. Ensure these environment variables are properly secured and *not* exposed to unauthorized users or processes.
        *   **c.** Use a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage secrets. The container configuration should only contain references to these secrets.
        *   **d.** Encrypt sensitive configuration data if it must be stored in files.
        *   **e.** Restrict file permissions on configuration files to prevent unauthorized access.
