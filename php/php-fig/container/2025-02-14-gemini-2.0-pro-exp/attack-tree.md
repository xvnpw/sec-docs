## Attack Tree Path: [1. Dependency Confusion/Substitution [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__dependency_confusionsubstitution__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector exploits the way package managers resolve dependencies.  The attacker aims to trick the application into installing a malicious package instead of the intended one.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Public Package Name Squatting [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__public_package_name_squatting__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker registers a malicious package on a public repository (like Packagist) with a name similar to a popular, but unregistered, service name or a common typo of a legitimate package.
    *   **1.1.1. Identify a commonly used, but unregistered, service name:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **1.1.2. Register a malicious package:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **1.1.3. Application installs the malicious package:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **1.1.4. Malicious package executes arbitrary code [CN]:**
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
        *   **Explanation:** This is the critical point where the attacker achieves code execution.  The malicious package, once installed, can run arbitrary code in the context of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Private Package Name Collision (Relevant Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__private_package_name_collision__relevant_critical_node_.md)

*   **1.2.3. Misconfigured composer.json [CN]:**
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **Explanation:** This is a critical configuration error. If the `composer.json` file is misconfigured to prioritize public repositories over private ones, the attacker can register a malicious package with the same name as a private package, and the application will install the malicious version.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Compromised Private Repository (Relevant Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__compromised_private_repository__relevant_critical_node_.md)

*   **1.3.1. Attacker gains access to the private package repository [CN]:**
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Very High
        *   Skill Level: Expert
        *   Detection Difficulty: Very Hard
        *   **Explanation:** This is a critical node because it gives the attacker complete control over the supply chain.  They can modify any package within the repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Vulnerabilities in Container Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/2__vulnerabilities_in_container_implementation.md)

*   **2.2. Unsafe Deserialization in `get()` [HR]**
    *   **Description:** This attack exploits vulnerabilities in how the container implementation handles deserialization of objects, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **2.2.1. Container implementation deserializes from untrusted sources [CN]:**
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: N/A
        *   Skill Level: N/A
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **Explanation:** This is the critical vulnerability. If the container deserializes data from user input or other untrusted sources without proper validation, it opens the door to attack.
    *   **2.2.3. Deserialization triggers execution of malicious code [CN]:**
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Very Hard
        *   **Explanation:** This is the critical point of exploitation.  The attacker's crafted serialized object triggers malicious code execution during the deserialization process (often through magic methods like `__wakeup()`).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Misconfiguration/Misuse of the Container [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3__misconfigurationmisuse_of_the_container__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** These attacks stem from improper configuration or usage of the container, even if the container implementation itself is secure.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Overly Permissive Service Definitions (Relevant Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__overly_permissive_service_definitions__relevant_critical_node_.md)

*   **3.1.1. Services configured with excessive privileges [CN]:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **Explanation:** This is a critical configuration error.  If services are granted more permissions than they need, a compromised service can be used to escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Exposure of Container Instance (Relevant Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__exposure_of_container_instance__relevant_critical_node_.md)

*   **3.2.1. Container instance made globally accessible [CN]:**
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **Explanation:** This is a critical design flaw.  Exposing the container allows any part of the application (or potentially external attackers) to request any service, bypassing intended access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3. Using Untrusted Input as Service IDs [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3__using_untrusted_input_as_service_ids__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack involves directly using user-supplied data to determine which service to retrieve from the container.
    *   **3.3.1. Application uses user-supplied input as service ID [CN]:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: N/A
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **Explanation:** This is the critical vulnerability.  It allows the attacker to request arbitrary services, potentially including those with sensitive functionality or those that are vulnerable to other attacks. This is a form of injection attack.
