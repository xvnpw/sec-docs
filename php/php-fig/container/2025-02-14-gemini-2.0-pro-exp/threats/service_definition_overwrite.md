# Deep Analysis: Service Definition Overwrite (PSR-11 Container)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Service Definition Overwrite" threat within the context of a PHP application using a PSR-11 compliant dependency injection container.  This includes identifying specific attack vectors, assessing the potential impact, and refining mitigation strategies beyond the initial threat model description.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers to secure their applications.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   **PSR-11 Container Interface:**  The core `get()` and `has()` methods are the primary points of interaction with the container, and thus the points where the impact of this threat manifests.
*   **Configuration Sources:**  We'll examine common configuration sources used with PSR-11 containers, including:
    *   PHP files (arrays, `ConfigProvider` classes)
    *   XML files
    *   YAML files
    *   Annotations (if used for configuration)
    *   Environment variables
    *   Databases (less common, but possible)
*   **Configuration Loading Mechanisms:**  The processes by which these configuration sources are parsed and loaded into the container.
*   **PHP-Specific Vulnerabilities:**  We'll consider PHP-specific vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to achieve service definition overwrites (e.g., file inclusion vulnerabilities, code injection).
* **Attack vectors**: We will consider attack vectors that are not directly related to the container, but can be used to overwrite service definition.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within the container implementation itself (e.g., bugs in PHP-DI or Symfony Container). We assume the container implementation is secure.
*   General system security (e.g., server hardening, network security).  We focus on application-level vulnerabilities.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Brainstorm and enumerate specific ways an attacker could potentially overwrite service definitions, considering various configuration sources and loading mechanisms.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  For each attack vector, analyze the underlying vulnerabilities that would need to be present for the attack to succeed.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Refine the impact assessment from the initial threat model, providing concrete examples of what an attacker could achieve.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing specific implementation details and best practices.
5.  **Code Examples (where applicable):**  Illustrate vulnerable scenarios and mitigation techniques with PHP code examples.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Attack Vector Identification

Here are several attack vectors, categorized by the configuration source or mechanism they target:

**A. File-Based Configuration (PHP, XML, YAML):**

1.  **File System Permissions:**  If the configuration file has overly permissive write access (e.g., `777` or writeable by the web server user), an attacker who gains *any* level of file system access (e.g., through a separate file upload vulnerability, LFI, RFI) can directly modify the file.
2.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** If the application is vulnerable to LFI or RFI, and the container configuration is loaded from a file, an attacker could potentially include a malicious file that redefines services.  This is particularly dangerous if the configuration loading mechanism doesn't validate the included file's contents.
3.  **Configuration Injection via Unvalidated Input:** If user input is directly used to construct file paths or configuration values *without proper sanitization and validation*, an attacker could inject malicious configuration data.  Example:  `$config = include('/path/to/config/' . $_GET['config_file'] . '.php');`
4.  **Template Injection:** If the configuration file is generated using a templating engine (e.g., Twig, Smarty), and user input is incorporated into the template without proper escaping, an attacker could inject malicious configuration directives.
5. **Symlink attacks**: If attacker can create symlink to configuration file, he can point it to malicious file.

**B. Environment Variables:**

1.  **Environment Variable Manipulation:** If the container configuration uses environment variables (e.g., to specify database credentials or service endpoints), an attacker who can modify environment variables (e.g., through a server misconfiguration, a vulnerability in a server management tool) can alter the container's behavior.
2.  **`.env` File Vulnerabilities:**  If the application uses a `.env` file to store environment variables, and this file is accidentally exposed (e.g., misconfigured web server, directory listing enabled), an attacker can read sensitive information and potentially modify the file if it has write access.

**C. Database-Based Configuration:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** If the container configuration is stored in a database, an attacker who can exploit an SQL injection vulnerability can modify the service definitions directly within the database.
2.  **Database Access:**  If an attacker gains direct access to the database (e.g., through weak credentials, a misconfigured database server), they can modify the configuration.

**D. Annotation-Based Configuration:**

1.  **Code Injection in Annotations:**  While less common, if annotations are used to define services, and user input is somehow reflected in the annotations (highly unlikely, but theoretically possible), an attacker could inject malicious code.

**E. Other Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Dependency Confusion/Substitution:** If an attacker can publish a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency used by the application, and the application's dependency management system (e.g., Composer) is misconfigured, the malicious package could be installed, potentially overwriting service definitions.
2.  **Phar Deserialization:** If the application loads configuration from a Phar archive, and the archive is created from untrusted sources, an attacker could craft a malicious Phar archive that exploits deserialization vulnerabilities to overwrite service definitions.
3. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If the application is vulnerable to SSRF, and the container configuration can be loaded from a URL, an attacker could potentially provide a URL to a malicious configuration file hosted on a server they control.

### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis

The success of these attack vectors depends on the presence of underlying vulnerabilities:

*   **Insecure File Permissions:**  The most common and critical vulnerability.
*   **File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (LFI/RFI):**  Allow attackers to include arbitrary files.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization Failures:**  Allow attackers to inject malicious data into configuration.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Allows attackers to modify database-stored configuration.
*   **Weak Authentication/Authorization:**  Allows attackers to gain access to configuration sources (e.g., database, environment variables).
*   **Misconfigured Web Server:**  Exposes configuration files or allows directory listing.
*   **Dependency Management Issues:**  Leads to the installation of malicious packages.
*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code through Phar archives.
* **SSRF Vulnerability**: Allows attackers to load configuration from arbitrary URL.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful service definition overwrite is **critical**.  Here are some specific examples:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The attacker can replace a legitimate service with a class that executes arbitrary PHP code.  This gives them complete control over the application and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Data Theft:**  The attacker can replace a service that handles sensitive data (e.g., a database connection, a user authentication service) with a malicious class that steals or exfiltrates the data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can replace a critical service with a class that throws exceptions or enters an infinite loop, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  If the compromised service is used in a security context (e.g., to check user permissions), the attacker can elevate their privileges within the application.
*   **Data Modification/Corruption:** The attacker can modify data by replacing services responsible for data persistence.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  By gaining arbitrary code execution, the attacker can potentially compromise the entire server, not just the application.

**Example Scenario:**

Suppose an application uses a `LoggerInterface` service to log events.  The original service definition might look like this (in a PHP array configuration):

```php
return [
    'LoggerInterface' => \DI\create(My\Application\Logger::class),
];
```

An attacker, through a file system vulnerability, overwrites this definition with:

```php
return [
    'LoggerInterface' => \DI\create(Attacker\MaliciousLogger::class),
];
```

The `Attacker\MaliciousLogger` class might contain code like this:

```php
namespace Attacker;

class MaliciousLogger implements \Psr\Log\LoggerInterface {
    public function log($level, $message, array $context = []) {
        // Execute arbitrary code passed in the log message
        eval($message);
    }
    // ... other required methods ...
}
```

Now, whenever the application attempts to log a message, the attacker's code is executed.  The attacker can simply trigger a log event with a specially crafted message to execute arbitrary PHP code.

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategy Refinement

The initial mitigation strategies are a good starting point.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1.  **Strictly Control File Permissions:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Configuration files should have the *most restrictive* permissions possible.
    *   **Production:**  Configuration files should be *read-only* for the web server user.  Ideally, create a dedicated user with even more restricted permissions than the standard web server user (e.g., `www-data` on Debian/Ubuntu) and grant that user read-only access.  *No* user should have write access in production.
    *   **Development:**  Developers may need write access during development, but this should be carefully controlled and monitored.  Use a separate development environment that is not accessible from the internet.
    *   **Tools:** Use `chmod` and `chown` (or equivalent commands on Windows) to set appropriate permissions and ownership.  Regularly audit file permissions.
    *   **Example (Linux):**
        ```bash
        chown root:www-data /path/to/config.php  # Owner: root, Group: www-data
        chmod 640 /path/to/config.php          # Read/write for owner, read for group, no access for others
        ```

2.  **Secure Configuration Loading Mechanism:**
    *   **Checksums:**  Calculate a checksum (e.g., SHA-256) of the configuration file and store it separately (e.g., in a database, in a separate file with even stricter permissions).  Before loading the configuration, verify that the checksum matches the stored value.  If it doesn't match, the file has been tampered with.
    *   **Digital Signatures:**  Use a private key to sign the configuration file.  The application can then use the corresponding public key to verify the signature before loading the configuration.  This provides stronger protection against tampering than checksums.
    *   **PHP `include` Hardening:** If using PHP `include` for configuration, ensure that:
        *   File paths are *absolute* and *not* derived from user input.
        *   The `open_basedir` directive in `php.ini` is set to restrict the files that PHP can access.
        *   Consider using `include_once` to prevent multiple inclusions of the same file.
    *   **Example (Checksum Verification):**

        ```php
        $configFile = '/path/to/config.php';
        $checksumFile = '/path/to/config.checksum';

        // Generate checksum (during deployment):
        $checksum = hash_file('sha256', $configFile);
        file_put_contents($checksumFile, $checksum);

        // Verify checksum (before loading configuration):
        $expectedChecksum = file_get_contents($checksumFile);
        $actualChecksum = hash_file('sha256', $configFile);

        if ($expectedChecksum !== $actualChecksum) {
            throw new \Exception('Configuration file has been tampered with!');
        }

        $config = include $configFile;
        ```

3.  **Treat Configuration as Code:**
    *   **Version Control (Git):**  Store configuration files in a Git repository.  This allows you to:
        *   Track changes over time.
        *   Easily revert to previous versions.
        *   Detect unauthorized modifications (using `git diff` or a Git hosting service's interface).
        *   Use Git hooks to enforce policies (e.g., prevent commits that introduce insecure configurations).
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Require code reviews for all changes to configuration files.
    *   **Automated Deployment:**  Use a deployment pipeline that automatically deploys configuration files from the Git repository to the production server.  This reduces the risk of manual errors and ensures consistency.

4.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Never Trust User Input:**  If *any* part of the container configuration is derived from user input (even indirectly), treat it as potentially malicious.
    *   **Whitelist, Not Blacklist:**  Validate input against a strict whitelist of allowed values, rather than trying to blacklist known bad values.
    *   **Type Validation:**  Ensure that input is of the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, boolean).
    *   **Sanitization:**  Escape or remove any characters that could be used to inject malicious code (e.g., `<`, `>`, `'`, `"`, `;`, `\`). Use appropriate escaping functions for the context (e.g., `htmlspecialchars()` for HTML output, `mysqli_real_escape_string()` for database queries).
    *   **Example (Path Validation):**

        ```php
        // BAD:
        $configFile = $_GET['config_file'] . '.php';
        $config = include $configFile;

        // GOOD:
        $allowedConfigFiles = ['config1', 'config2', 'config3'];
        $configFile = $_GET['config_file'] ?? 'config1'; // Default to 'config1'

        if (!in_array($configFile, $allowedConfigFiles)) {
            throw new \Exception('Invalid configuration file!');
        }

        $config = include '/path/to/configs/' . $configFile . '.php'; // Use absolute path
        ```

5.  **Immutable Configuration:**
    *   **Compiled Container:**  Many container implementations (e.g., PHP-DI, Symfony Container) support compiling the container configuration into a single PHP file.  This compiled configuration is typically faster to load and *cannot be modified at runtime*.  This is the recommended approach for production environments.
    *   **Read-Only Filesystem:**  Mount the configuration directory as read-only in production. This prevents any modifications, even if an attacker gains write access to the web server user.
    *   **Example (PHP-DI Compilation):**

        ```php
        // Create container builder
        $containerBuilder = new \DI\ContainerBuilder();

        // Add definitions
        $containerBuilder->addDefinitions('config.php');

        // Enable compilation
        $containerBuilder->enableCompilation('/path/to/cache');

        // Build the container
        $container = $containerBuilder->build();
        ```

6. **Defense in Depth:** Combine multiple mitigation strategies to create a layered defense. Even if one layer is bypassed, other layers can still provide protection.

7. **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application and its infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

8. **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the container library, PHP, and all other dependencies to the latest versions to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

9. **Monitor and Log:** Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect and respond to suspicious activity. Log any attempts to access or modify configuration files.
