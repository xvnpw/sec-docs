# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Untrusted Input as Service IDs

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the vulnerability arising from using untrusted user input directly as service IDs when retrieving services from a PSR-11 compliant dependency injection container.  We aim to understand the potential impact, exploitation methods, mitigation strategies, and detection techniques related to this specific vulnerability.  This analysis will inform secure coding practices and vulnerability remediation efforts.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

**3.3. Using Untrusted Input as Service IDs [HR]**
    *   **3.3.1. Application uses user-supplied input as service ID [CN]**

The scope includes:

*   Applications using the `php-fig/container` interface (PSR-11).
*   Scenarios where user-supplied data (e.g., GET/POST parameters, request headers, cookies) is directly used as the `$id` argument in the `ContainerInterface::get($id)` method.
*   The potential consequences of an attacker successfully controlling the service ID.
*   PHP-specific exploitation techniques and mitigation strategies.

The scope *excludes*:

*   Vulnerabilities within specific services themselves (this analysis focuses on the container interaction).
*   Other attack vectors against the application that do not involve the container.
*   Container implementations that deviate significantly from the PSR-11 specification (although general principles may still apply).

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the vulnerability and its underlying cause.
2.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, including example code snippets and attack payloads.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential impact of successful exploitation, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.3.1

### 4.1. Vulnerability Definition

The vulnerability, "Application uses user-supplied input as service ID [CN]," occurs when an application directly uses untrusted, user-controlled data as the service identifier (`$id`) when calling the `get($id)` method of a PSR-11 `ContainerInterface` implementation.  This allows an attacker to potentially request any service registered within the container, bypassing intended access controls and potentially leading to severe security consequences.

**Underlying Cause:**  The root cause is the lack of input validation and sanitization before using user-supplied data in a security-sensitive context (retrieving a service from the container).  The application implicitly trusts the user-provided service ID, assuming it will always be a legitimate and expected value.

### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Accessing Sensitive Services**

Consider a container configured with services like `DatabaseConnection`, `AdminPanel`, and `UserAuthentication`.  The application normally uses a controlled mechanism to determine which service to retrieve.  However, a vulnerable code snippet might look like this:

```php
// Vulnerable Code
$serviceId = $_GET['service']; // User-controlled input
$service = $container->get($serviceId);
$service->doSomething();
```

An attacker could then craft a request like:

`http://example.com/vulnerable.php?service=AdminPanel`

If the `AdminPanel` service exists and doesn't have its own robust access controls, the attacker might gain unauthorized access to administrative functionality.  Even if `AdminPanel` *does* have checks, the attacker has bypassed the *intended* access control mechanism, which is a vulnerability in itself.

**Scenario 2: Triggering Unexpected Behavior**

Even if services have internal security checks, an attacker might be able to trigger unexpected behavior or resource exhaustion.  For example, if a service named `ExpensiveOperation` exists and performs a computationally intensive task, an attacker could repeatedly request it:

`http://example.com/vulnerable.php?service=ExpensiveOperation`

This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Scenario 3:  Information Disclosure via Error Messages**

If the requested service ID does *not* exist, the `ContainerInterface::get()` method *must* throw a `NotFoundExceptionInterface` (according to PSR-11).  If the application's error handling is misconfigured to display detailed error messages to the user, this can leak information about the registered services.  An attacker could probe for service names by trying different IDs and observing the error messages.

**Scenario 4: Chaining with other vulnerabilities**
If attacker can control which service is loaded, he can load service that is vulnerable to another attack, for example, service that is vulnerable to SQL injection.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of this vulnerability is highly dependent on the specific services registered in the container and their functionality.  However, the potential impact can be categorized as follows:

*   **Confidentiality:**  High.  Attackers could gain access to sensitive data or functionality exposed by improperly accessed services (e.g., database credentials, user data, internal APIs).
*   **Integrity:**  High.  Attackers could modify data or system state through unauthorized service access (e.g., deleting users, changing configurations, injecting malicious code).
*   **Availability:**  Medium to High.  Attackers could trigger denial-of-service conditions by requesting resource-intensive services or exploiting vulnerabilities within those services.

Overall, this vulnerability represents a **critical** risk due to its potential to completely bypass intended access controls and grant attackers significant control over the application.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

The primary mitigation strategy is to **never directly use untrusted input as a service ID**.  Instead, implement one or more of the following approaches:

1.  **Whitelist Approach (Strongly Recommended):**

    Maintain a whitelist of allowed service IDs.  Before retrieving a service, validate the user-provided input against this whitelist.  This is the most secure approach.

    ```php
    // Secure Code - Whitelist
    $allowedServices = [
        'userService' => 'App\Service\UserService',
        'productService' => 'App\Service\ProductService',
        // ... other allowed services
    ];

    $serviceKey = $_GET['service']; // User input is a *key* to the whitelist

    if (array_key_exists($serviceKey, $allowedServices)) {
        $serviceId = $allowedServices[$serviceKey];
        $service = $container->get($serviceId);
        $service->doSomething();
    } else {
        // Handle invalid service request (e.g., return 404, log error)
    }
    ```

2.  **Indirect Lookup (Mapping):**

    Use user input as an index or key to look up the *actual* service ID in a trusted mapping.  This is similar to the whitelist approach but might be more flexible in some cases.

    ```php
    // Secure Code - Indirect Lookup
    $serviceMap = [
        '1' => 'App\Service\UserService',
        '2' => 'App\Service\ProductService',
    ];

    $serviceIndex = $_GET['service_index']; // User input is an *index*

    if (isset($serviceMap[$serviceIndex])) {
        $serviceId = $serviceMap[$serviceIndex];
        $service = $container->get($serviceId);
        $service->doSomething();
    } else {
        // Handle invalid service request
    }
    ```

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Less Reliable):**

    While *not sufficient on its own*, strict input validation and sanitization can reduce the risk.  However, it's extremely difficult to anticipate all possible malicious inputs, especially if service IDs are complex strings.  This approach should *only* be used as a defense-in-depth measure in addition to a whitelist or indirect lookup.  Avoid relying solely on this.

    ```php
    // Less Reliable - Input Validation (Defense-in-Depth ONLY)
    $serviceId = $_GET['service'];

    // Very basic validation - insufficient on its own!
    if (preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/', $serviceId)) {
        $service = $container->get($serviceId);
        $service->doSomething();
    } else {
        // Handle invalid input
    }
    ```
    This example is weak because it only allows alphanumeric characters and underscores. A more robust validation would need to be extremely specific to the expected service ID format, and even then, it's prone to errors.

4. **Secure Container Configuration:**
Ensure that the container itself is configured securely. Avoid registering services with excessive privileges or unnecessary dependencies.

### 4.5. Detection Techniques

1.  **Static Analysis:**

    *   **Code Review:**  Manually inspect the code for any instances where user input (e.g., `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`, `$request->get()`) is directly passed to the `$container->get()` method without proper validation.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm, Phan) with security-focused rulesets.  These tools can often detect the use of tainted data in sensitive contexts.  Look for rules related to "taint analysis," "injection vulnerabilities," or "untrusted input."

2.  **Dynamic Analysis:**

    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing, specifically attempting to inject various service IDs into the application's input fields.  Monitor the application's behavior and logs for any unexpected service calls or errors.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to automatically generate a large number of different inputs and test the application's response.  This can help uncover unexpected edge cases.

3. **Code Review Guidelines:**
    *   Always assume that all user input is malicious.
    *   Never directly use user input as service IDs.
    *   Implement a whitelist or indirect lookup mechanism.
    *   Use static analysis tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits.

### 4.6. Related Vulnerabilities

This vulnerability is closely related to other injection vulnerabilities, such as:

*   **SQL Injection:** If a retrieved service interacts with a database, and that service itself is vulnerable to SQL injection, the attacker could chain these vulnerabilities.
*   **Command Injection:**  If a service executes system commands, and the attacker can control the arguments passed to those commands, this could lead to command injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If a service renders user input without proper escaping, and the attacker can control that input, this could lead to XSS.
*   **Path Traversal:** If a service interacts with the file system, and the attacker can control file paths, this could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

The key takeaway is that controlling the service ID gives the attacker a powerful entry point to potentially exploit other vulnerabilities within the application.

## 5. Conclusion

The vulnerability of using untrusted input as service IDs in a PSR-11 container is a critical security risk.  It allows attackers to bypass intended access controls and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive services or trigger unexpected behavior.  The most effective mitigation strategy is to use a whitelist or indirect lookup mechanism to ensure that only trusted service IDs are used.  Regular code reviews, static analysis, and dynamic analysis are essential for detecting and preventing this vulnerability. By understanding the attack vector and implementing the recommended mitigations, developers can significantly improve the security of their PHP applications that utilize dependency injection containers.
