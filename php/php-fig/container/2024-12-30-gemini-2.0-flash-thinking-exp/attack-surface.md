*   **Attack Surface: Configuration Injection/Manipulation**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can influence the container's configuration (service definitions, parameters) if it's sourced from user-controlled input.
    *   **How Container Contributes:** The container relies on configuration to define and instantiate services. If this configuration is dynamic and influenced by external sources, it becomes a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An application reads service definitions from a YAML file whose path is provided in a query parameter. An attacker could manipulate this parameter to point to a malicious YAML file containing definitions for harmful services.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, service overriding leading to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid sourcing container configuration directly from user-controlled input.
        *   If dynamic configuration is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all input used to build the configuration.
        *   Use a predefined and trusted configuration source that is not directly accessible or modifiable by users.
        *   Implement access controls to protect configuration files.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Factory Functions/Closures**
    *   **Description:** Security flaws within the factory functions or closures used to create service instances can be exploited.
    *   **How Container Contributes:** The container relies on these factories to instantiate and potentially configure services. If these factories are vulnerable, the resulting services will also be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A factory function for a database connection service directly uses unsanitized user input for database credentials, leading to potential SQL injection if the created connection is used without further sanitization.
    *   **Impact:**  Vulnerabilities within the created services (e.g., SQL injection, remote code execution), data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and secure all factory functions and closures used in service definitions.
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly within factory functions without proper validation and sanitization.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when writing factory logic.
        *   Consider using constructor injection instead of complex factory logic where possible, as it can be easier to reason about and secure.

*   **Attack Surface: Dependency Confusion/Substitution**
    *   **Description:** An attacker could register a malicious service with the same identifier as a legitimate service, causing the application to use the malicious version.
    *   **How Container Contributes:** The container uses string identifiers to register and resolve services. If the registration process is not carefully controlled, malicious substitutions can occur.
    *   **Example:** An application expects a service named `mailer`. An attacker, through a vulnerability in the service registration process, registers their own malicious `mailer` service that intercepts and steals emails.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution (if the substituted service is designed to be malicious).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that service registration is restricted and only performed by trusted parts of the application.
        *   Implement strict control over who can register services and under what conditions.
        *   Consider using more robust service identification mechanisms beyond simple strings, if the container implementation allows for it (though `php-fig/container` primarily uses string identifiers).
        *   Regularly audit registered services to ensure no unexpected or malicious services are present.
