**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **CRITICAL NODE Exploit Weaknesses in PHP-FIG Container Usage:**
    *   This level represents the general approach the attacker will take. The PHP-FIG Container itself is an interface, so vulnerabilities are more likely to arise from how it's used and the specific container implementation chosen.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Manipulate Service Definitions:**
    *   The attacker aims to alter how services are defined within the container, either by introducing new, malicious definitions or by modifying existing ones.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Inject Malicious Service Definition:**
    *   The attacker aims to introduce their own service definitions into the container.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Via Configuration Files:**
    *   Many containers load service definitions from configuration files (e.g., YAML, PHP arrays).

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Overwrite Existing Configuration:**
    *   If the attacker can write to the configuration files (e.g., through a file upload vulnerability or compromised credentials), they can directly inject their definitions.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Replace Existing Service Definition:**
    *   The attacker aims to replace a legitimate service with a malicious one.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE With a Malicious Implementation:**
    *   This malicious service will perform actions the attacker desires.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE That Executes Arbitrary Code on Instantiation:**
    *   The malicious service's constructor or a method called immediately after instantiation could execute attacker-controlled code.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Factory/Callable Vulnerabilities:**
    *   This involves targeting the mechanisms used by the container to create service instances, which often involve factory functions or callables.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Inject Malicious Factory Function:**
    *   Containers often use factory functions or callables to create service instances.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH Via Configuration:**
    *   Similar to injecting service definitions, the attacker might be able to inject malicious factory functions through configuration.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH Exploit Vulnerabilities in Existing Factories:**
    *   The factory functions themselves might have vulnerabilities.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH Parameter Injection in Factory Callables:**
    *   If the factory function takes parameters that are derived from user input without proper sanitization, the attacker might be able to inject malicious values.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Exploit Container Implementation Specific Vulnerabilities:**
    *   This level focuses on vulnerabilities within the specific container library being used (e.g., Pimple, PHP-DI, Symfony DI).

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if container uses serialization):**
    *   Some containers might use serialization for caching or other purposes.

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH CRITICAL NODE Inject Malicious Serialized Data:**
    *   If the attacker can inject malicious serialized data that the container deserializes, they can potentially achieve remote code execution.
