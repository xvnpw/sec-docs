# Threat Model Analysis for php-fig/container

## Threat: [Overriding Legitimate Service Definitions](./threats/overriding_legitimate_service_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate the application's logic (if it allows) to directly use the container's API (e.g., `ContainerInterface::set()`) to replace legitimate service definitions with malicious ones. This allows for injecting code or altering the behavior of core application components *through the container itself*.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, privilege escalation, complete compromise of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ContainerInterface::set()`, or any mechanism within the container implementation allowing modification of definitions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to container modification methods. Ensure only trusted parts of the application can modify the container.
        *   Avoid exposing container modification capabilities directly to user input or external data.
        *   Consider using immutable container configurations where feasible to prevent runtime modifications.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks before allowing any modifications to the container.

## Threat: [Execution of Arbitrary Code in Factory Functions](./threats/execution_of_arbitrary_code_in_factory_functions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the code *within* factory functions that are registered with the container. If these functions execute untrusted code based on user input or external data that is passed to them during service creation *orchestrated by the container*, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Service factory functions registered within the container, the container's instantiation process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and secure the code within all factory functions registered with the container.
        *   Sanitize and validate any input that is passed to factory functions during service creation.
        *   Avoid performing operations with external dependencies or untrusted data directly within factory functions without proper security measures.

## Threat: [Leaking Sensitive Information in Container Definitions](./threats/leaking_sensitive_information_in_container_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets directly within the container's configuration files or within the code of factory functions *that are managed by the container*. An attacker gaining access to these definitions (even if not publicly accessible through the web server) can retrieve this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to external services or databases, potential financial loss or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Container configuration loading mechanism, factory function definitions within the container.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode sensitive information in container definitions or factory function code.
        *   Utilize environment variables to store sensitive configuration, injecting them into the container.
        *   Employ dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to manage and access secrets, and integrate their retrieval into the service creation process managed by the container.
        *   Secure the storage and access to container configuration files.

## Threat: [Modification of Cached Container Definitions](./threats/modification_of_cached_container_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** If the directory where the container caches its compiled definitions is writable by unauthorized processes, an attacker could directly modify these cached definitions. This would cause the container to load and use the attacker's manipulated definitions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious behavior *when the container loads these modified definitions*.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, unpredictable application behavior, persistent compromise until the cache is cleared.
    *   **Affected Component:** Container's caching mechanism, file system interaction for cache storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the container's cache directory has strict file system permissions, allowing write access only to the process that manages the container's cache.
        *   Consider using a read-only cache in production environments if the container configuration is static.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums) for cached definitions to detect unauthorized modifications before loading them.
        *   Regularly audit the permissions of the container's cache directory.
