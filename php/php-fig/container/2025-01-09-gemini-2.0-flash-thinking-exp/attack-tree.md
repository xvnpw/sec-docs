# Attack Tree Analysis for php-fig/container

Objective: Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the `php-fig/container` library or its usage.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **HIGH RISK** AND [Exploit Container Configuration/Registration] **CRITICAL NODE**
    *   **HIGH RISK** OR [Inject Malicious Service Definition] **CRITICAL NODE**
        *   **HIGH RISK** Exploit Unprotected Configuration Loading
        *   **HIGH RISK** Overwrite Existing Service Definition
    *   OR [Manipulate Factory/Closure Definitions] **CRITICAL NODE**
        *   **HIGH RISK** Inject Malicious Callable
```


## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK AND [Exploit Container Configuration/Registration] CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_and__exploit_container_configurationregistration__critical_node.md)

This node represents the attacker's ability to influence how services are defined within the container. Success at this stage is crucial for many subsequent attacks.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application loads container configurations. This could involve loading configurations from untrusted sources like user input, external files without proper validation, or databases with insufficient sanitization.
        *   Exploiting weaknesses in the application's design that allow for the modification of container definitions after the initial setup. This might occur through administrative interfaces, insecure API endpoints, or other mechanisms that lack proper access control.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK OR [Inject Malicious Service Definition] CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_or__inject_malicious_service_definition__critical_node.md)

This node focuses on the attacker's ability to introduce a service definition that, when instantiated, performs malicious actions.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **HIGH RISK Exploit Unprotected Configuration Loading:**
            *   An attacker leverages the application's reliance on untrusted sources for container configuration.
            *   By manipulating these sources (e.g., modifying a user-uploaded file, injecting data into a database), the attacker can inject a service definition that points to a malicious class or uses a malicious factory.
            *   When the container attempts to instantiate this service, the malicious code is executed.
        *   **HIGH RISK Overwrite Existing Service Definition:**
            *   The attacker exploits a flaw in the application that allows for the modification of existing service definitions.
            *   They identify a critical service and overwrite its definition with one pointing to a malicious implementation.
            *   When the application requests the service, it receives the malicious version, leading to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR [Manipulate Factory/Closure Definitions] CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/or__manipulate_factoryclosure_definitions__critical_node.md)

Instead of directly injecting a malicious service class, the attacker focuses on manipulating the code responsible for creating service instances.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **HIGH RISK Inject Malicious Callable:**
            *   The attacker finds a way to inject a malicious callable (a function, method, or closure) into the container's service definitions.
            *   This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application registers services, potentially through input fields or API parameters that are not properly sanitized.
            *   When the container attempts to instantiate a service using this manipulated factory or closure, the attacker's code is executed.
