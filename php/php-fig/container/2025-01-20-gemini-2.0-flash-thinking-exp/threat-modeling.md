# Threat Model Analysis for php-fig/container

## Threat: [Dynamic Container Configuration Based on User Input](./threats/dynamic_container_configuration_based_on_user_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user input that is directly used to configure the container, such as specifying service names, class names, or constructor arguments. This could involve crafting malicious input through forms, API requests, or URL parameters.

**Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution. By injecting malicious class names or constructor arguments, an attacker could force the container to instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server.

**Affected Component:** Container's `get()` method or similar resolution methods, and the configuration loading/registration process if it allows dynamic input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never directly use user input to define service names, class names, or constructor arguments.**
*   Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user input that influences container configuration indirectly.
*   Use a whitelist approach for allowed service names or class names if dynamic selection is absolutely necessary.
*   Consider using pre-defined configuration structures that are not directly modifiable by user input.

## Threat: [Overriding Existing Service Definitions](./threats/overriding_existing_service_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability that allows them to override existing service definitions within the container. This could be achieved through manipulating configuration files, exploiting insecure administrative interfaces, or leveraging vulnerabilities in extension mechanisms.

**Impact:**  Various impacts depending on the overridden service. This could lead to:
*   **Denial of Service:** Replacing a critical service with a non-functional one.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Replacing a data access service with one that modifies data in a malicious way.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Replacing a service with one that grants higher privileges.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Replacing a service to intercept and log sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** Container's `set()` method or similar methods used for registering or overriding services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for any functionality that allows modification of the container's service definitions.
*   Restrict access to container configuration files and administrative interfaces.
*   Implement integrity checks to ensure that service definitions have not been tampered with.
*   Consider using immutable container configurations in production environments.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Service Resolution](./threats/arbitrary_service_resolution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could find a way to control which services are resolved from the container, potentially accessing sensitive services or triggering unintended actions. This might involve manipulating URL parameters, form data, or API requests that influence the service resolution process.

**Impact:**
*   **Access to Sensitive Functionality:**  Resolving services that perform privileged operations.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Resolving services that expose sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service:** Resolving services that consume excessive resources or cause errors.

**Affected Component:** Container's `get()` method or similar resolution methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict authorization checks before resolving services, ensuring the user has the necessary permissions to access the requested service.
*   Avoid exposing the container's `get()` method or similar resolution methods directly to user input.
*   Use a controlled and predefined set of service names that can be accessed based on user roles or permissions.

## Threat: [Dependency Injection into Unexpected Components](./threats/dependency_injection_into_unexpected_components.md)

**Description:** Due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities, dependencies might be injected into components where they are not intended or where they could be exploited. This could happen if the container's configuration is too permissive or if there are flaws in the dependency injection logic.

**Impact:**  Unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities depending on the injected dependency and the receiving component. This could lead to:
*   **Information Disclosure:** Injecting a logging service into a component that handles sensitive data, allowing the attacker to intercept it.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Injecting a service with higher privileges into a component with lower privileges.
*   **Code Execution:** Injecting a factory or invokable object that can be triggered with malicious input.

**Affected Component:** Container's dependency injection mechanism, including the configuration and the resolution process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully define the dependencies for each service and component.
*   Use type hinting and interface contracts to enforce the expected types of injected dependencies.
*   Regularly review the container's configuration to ensure that dependencies are injected correctly and securely.
*   Consider using container compilation or freezing in production to prevent runtime modifications to dependency injection.

## Threat: [Singleton Misuse Leading to Shared State Vulnerabilities](./threats/singleton_misuse_leading_to_shared_state_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Services incorrectly configured as singletons when they should be per-request or transient can lead to shared state between different requests or users. An attacker could exploit this shared state to access or manipulate data belonging to other users.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Leakage:** One user's data being accessible to another user.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bypass:** If a singleton service stores CSRF tokens.
*   **Data Corruption:** One user's actions unintentionally affecting another user's data.

**Affected Component:** Container's scope management for singleton services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully consider the appropriate scope for each service (singleton, prototype, etc.) based on its intended use and state management.
*   Avoid storing per-request or user-specific data in singleton services.
*   If a singleton service needs to manage state, ensure it is properly isolated and scoped to the current request or user.
