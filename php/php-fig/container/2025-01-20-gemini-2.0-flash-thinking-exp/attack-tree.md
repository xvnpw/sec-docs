## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Container Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_container_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents a fundamental weakness in how the application manages its container configuration. If an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in this area, they gain significant control over the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Service Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_service_definitions.md)

This node is the core objective of many attacks targeting the container. By successfully injecting malicious service definitions, an attacker can introduce their own code or manipulate existing services to achieve their goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Crafted Configuration File](./attack_tree_paths/supply_crafted_configuration_file.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to overwrite existing configuration files with their own crafted versions containing malicious service definitions.
*   **Mechanism:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities such as:
    *   Insecure file permissions allowing unauthorized write access to configuration files.
    *   Path traversal vulnerabilities that allow writing to arbitrary locations on the file system.
    *   Exploiting weaknesses in backup or restore mechanisms to inject malicious configurations.
*   **Impact:** Successful injection of a malicious configuration file can lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution: The malicious service definition could instantiate a class that executes arbitrary code.
    *   Data Exfiltration: The malicious service could be designed to access and transmit sensitive data.
    *   Denial of Service: The malicious configuration could disrupt the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Environment Variables](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_environment_variables.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to set or modify environment variables that are used by the application to define or configure services within the container.
*   **Mechanism:** This could involve:
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deployment environment that allow setting environment variables (e.g., container orchestration misconfigurations).
    *   Compromising a related system or service that has the authority to set environment variables.
    *   In some cases, if the application directly reads environment variables from user input (though this is a poor practice), this could be a direct attack vector.
*   **Impact:** Successfully manipulating environment variables to inject malicious service definitions can lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution: Similar to crafted configuration files, malicious service definitions can execute arbitrary code.
    *   Service Substitution: Legitimate services can be replaced with malicious implementations, allowing the attacker to intercept or manipulate application logic.
    *   Configuration Tampering:  Attackers can alter the behavior of existing services by modifying their configuration through environment variables.
