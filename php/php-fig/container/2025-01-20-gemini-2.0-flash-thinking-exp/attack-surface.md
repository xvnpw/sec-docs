# Attack Surface Analysis for php-fig/container

## Attack Surface: [Service Definition Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/service_definition_injectionmanipulation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can inject or manipulate service definitions within the container's configuration.
* **How Container Contributes:** The container relies on these definitions to instantiate and manage services. If the source of these definitions is not properly secured, it becomes a point of attack.
* **Example:** An attacker modifies a configuration file (e.g., YAML, PHP array) used to define services, replacing a legitimate service with one that executes malicious code upon instantiation.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Configuration Sources:** Ensure configuration files are stored securely with restricted access.
    * **Input Validation:** If service definitions are derived from external input, rigorously validate and sanitize this input.
    * **Immutable Configuration:** Where possible, make the container configuration immutable after deployment.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid granting excessive permissions to modify container configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Service Factories](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_service_factories.md)

* **Description:** Service factories used by the container to create service instances contain vulnerabilities.
* **How Container Contributes:** The container relies on these factories to instantiate services. If a factory is vulnerable, every service instantiated through it becomes a potential attack vector.
* **Example:** A service factory deserializes user-provided data without proper sanitization, leading to arbitrary code execution through PHP's `unserialize()` vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, privilege escalation.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Factory Implementation:** Thoroughly review and secure the code within service factories, paying attention to input validation, output encoding, and secure use of external libraries.
    * **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in factory code.
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies used within factories up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusionsubstitution.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the resolution of service dependencies, substituting legitimate dependencies with malicious ones.
* **How Container Contributes:** The container is responsible for resolving and injecting dependencies. If the mechanism for dependency resolution is vulnerable, it can be exploited.
* **Example:** An attacker modifies an environment variable or configuration setting that the container uses to locate a dependency, pointing it to a malicious class or service.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Dependency Resolution:** Ensure the sources used for dependency resolution are secure and cannot be easily manipulated.
    * **Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of resolved dependencies.
    * **Explicit Configuration:** Prefer explicit configuration of dependencies over relying on potentially insecure automatic resolution mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Issues (if container state is serialized)](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_issues__if_container_state_is_serialized_.md)

* **Description:** If the container's state (including service definitions or instantiated services) is serialized, it becomes vulnerable to insecure deserialization attacks.
* **How Container Contributes:** The container's decision to serialize its state introduces this risk.
* **Example:** The container's configuration or cached service instances are serialized and stored. An attacker crafts malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid Serialization:** If possible, avoid serializing the container's state.
    * **Secure Deserialization:** If serialization is necessary, use secure deserialization techniques and avoid using PHP's `unserialize()` on untrusted data. Consider using safer alternatives like JSON or specific serialization libraries with security features.
    * **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks (e.g., using HMAC) on serialized data to detect tampering.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** The container's configuration itself is vulnerable (e.g., stored insecurely, accessible to unauthorized users).
* **How Container Contributes:** The container's behavior is dictated by its configuration. If this configuration is compromised, the entire application's security can be affected.
* **Example:** A configuration file containing database credentials or API keys used by services within the container is publicly accessible.
* **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access, arbitrary code execution (through manipulated service definitions).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Storage:** Store container configuration files securely with restricted access.
    * **Environment Variables:** Prefer using environment variables for sensitive configuration data.
    * **Configuration Management:** Use secure configuration management practices and tools.
    * **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit container configurations for potential vulnerabilities.
