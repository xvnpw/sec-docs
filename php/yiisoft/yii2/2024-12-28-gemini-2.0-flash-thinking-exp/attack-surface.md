Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Yii2, with high and critical severity:

- **Mass Assignment Vulnerability**
    - **Description:** Allows attackers to modify unintended model attributes by including extra data in the request.
    - **How Yii2 Contributes:** Yii2's Active Record allows mass assignment by default. If `safeAttributes()` or scenarios are not properly configured, any attribute can be modified.
    - **Example:** A user registration form might have fields for `username` and `password`. An attacker could add an extra field like `is_admin=1` in the POST request, potentially elevating their privileges if the `is_admin` attribute is not marked as unsafe.
    - **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Explicitly define safe attributes using the `safeAttributes()` method in your model.
        - Use scenarios to define different sets of safe attributes for different actions.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection**
    - **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    - **How Yii2 Contributes:** If user-provided data is directly rendered in views without proper HTML encoding, Yii2 will output the raw HTML, including any malicious scripts.
    - **Example:** A comment section where user input is displayed without encoding. An attacker could submit a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which would execute in other users' browsers.
    - **Impact:** Account hijacking, data theft, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Always use `Html::encode()` when displaying user-provided data in views.
        - Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of scripts.

- **SQL Injection through Unsafe Query Building**
    - **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.
    - **How Yii2 Contributes:** While Yii2's Active Record and Query Builder offer protection, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities by using raw SQL fragments or not properly parameterizing queries when using `createCommand()`.
    - **Example:**  A search functionality where the search term is directly concatenated into a SQL query: `$searchTerm = $_GET['term']; $results = Yii::$app->db->createCommand("SELECT * FROM items WHERE name LIKE '%" . $searchTerm . "%'")->queryAll();`. An attacker could input `%' OR 1=1 --` to bypass the intended query.
    - **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Always use parameterized queries or the Query Builder's methods for building queries.
        - Avoid using raw SQL fragments with user input.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Token Bypass**
    - **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on a web application.
    - **How Yii2 Contributes:** Yii2 provides CSRF protection, but if it's not enabled or if there are weaknesses in its implementation or validation, it can be bypassed.
    - **Example:** A form submission without a CSRF token. An attacker could create a malicious website that submits a form to the vulnerable application, performing actions as the logged-in user.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or deleting data.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in your application configuration.
        - Use Yii2's `yii\widgets\ActiveForm` or `yii\helpers\Html::beginForm()` with the CSRF token enabled.

- **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using `unserialize()` directly)**
    - **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious serialized objects that, when unserialized by the application, can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    - **How Yii2 Contributes:** While Yii2 encourages safer alternatives like JSON, developers might still use `unserialize()` directly on user-provided data or data from untrusted sources within a Yii2 application.
    - **Example:**  Storing user session data in a database as a serialized string and then unserializing it. An attacker could manipulate the serialized data to inject malicious objects.
    - **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Avoid using `unserialize()` on user-provided data or data from untrusted sources.
        - Use safer serialization formats like JSON.

- **Insecure File Upload Configurations**
    - **Description:** Misconfigured file upload settings can allow attackers to upload malicious files, such as web shells, to the server.
    - **How Yii2 Contributes:** While the core issue is configuration, not leveraging Yii2's file upload validation features contributes to the risk.
    - **Example:**  A file upload form that doesn't validate file types or sizes. An attacker could upload a PHP script disguised as an image, which could then be executed on the server.
    - **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, data compromise.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Utilize Yii2's file validation rules to check file types and sizes.
        - Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions.

- **Vulnerabilities in Yii2 Extensions**
    - **Description:** Third-party extensions might contain their own vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the application.
    - **How Yii2 Contributes:** Yii2's modular architecture relies on extensions, making the application's security dependent on the security of these extensions.
    - **Example:** An outdated or poorly maintained extension has a known security vulnerability that an attacker can exploit.
    - **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the extension, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or other issues.
    - **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High)
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update Yii2 and all its extensions to the latest versions.
        - Carefully evaluate the security and reputation of extensions before using them.
        - Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities in used extensions.
