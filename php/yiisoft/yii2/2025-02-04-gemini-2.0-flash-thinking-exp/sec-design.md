# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Web applications built using Yii Framework are the critical business processes. The framework's security and reliability directly impact the security and availability of these applications. Compromise of the framework can lead to widespread compromise of applications built upon it.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Data sensitivity depends on the specific applications built using Yii. The framework itself does not handle specific business data, but it provides the foundation for applications that may handle highly sensitive data, including:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of users (names, addresses, emails, phone numbers).
    - Financial data (credit card information, transaction history).
    - Authentication credentials (passwords, API keys).
    - Business-critical data (customer data, intellectual property, trade secrets).
  - The sensitivity level of data handled by applications built with Yii can range from low (publicly available information) to high (sensitive personal or financial data), depending on the application's purpose and functionality.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the target risk appetite for applications built with Yii Framework (e.g., startup with higher risk tolerance vs. Fortune 500 with strict security requirements)?
  - Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that applications built with Yii Framework need to adhere to?
  - What are the most common deployment environments for Yii Framework applications (cloud, on-premises, hybrid)?
  - Are there specific security tools or technologies that are commonly used or recommended with Yii Framework applications?
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in Yii Framework itself and in Yii extensions?
- Assumptions:
  - The design document assumes a general web application security context, focusing on common web application vulnerabilities and security best practices.
  - It is assumed that applications built with Yii Framework will handle user data and require standard security controls like authentication, authorization, input validation, and protection against common web attacks.
  - The deployment architecture described is a common LAMP stack setup, but other deployment options are also possible.
  - The build process includes basic security checks like SAST and dependency scanning, but more advanced security measures may be necessary depending on the risk profile of the application.
  - The security recommendations are general best practices and may need to be tailored based on the specific requirements and risk assessment of individual applications built with Yii Framework.
