# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for yiisoft/yii2

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization - Leverage Yii2's Built-in Validation Rules](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_-_leverage_yii2's_built-in_validation_rules.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Validation Rules in Models:** For each model handling user input, define comprehensive validation rules within the `rules()` method. Utilize Yii2's built-in validators (e.g., `required`, `string`, `integer`, `email`, `url`, `date`, `boolean`, `unique`, `exist`, custom validators). Specify data types, lengths, formats, allowed values, and constraints for each input attribute.
    2.  **Apply Validation in Controllers/Actions:** In controllers/actions processing user input, call `$model->validate()` before further logic. Handle validation errors appropriately using `$model->getErrors()`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Medium):** Indirectly reduces risk by ensuring data types and formats, preventing malicious SQL code injection.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Low):** Indirectly mitigates XSS by ensuring input data conforms to expected formats.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (High):** Prevents invalid data storage, ensuring data consistency.
    *   **Application Logic Errors (Medium):** Reduces errors from processing invalid input.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Medium
    *   Cross-Site Scripting: Low
    *   Data Integrity Issues: High
    *   Application Logic Errors: Medium
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `app\models\ContactForm.php` and `app\models\User.php`. Basic validation rules are defined in model layer.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing comprehensive validation rules in API endpoints (`app\controllers\ApiController.php`) and incomplete rules for complex models like `app\models\Product.php` and `app\models\Order.php`. Missing validation in custom form requests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Encoding and Sanitization with HtmlPurifier](./mitigation_strategies/output_encoding_and_sanitization_with_htmlpurifier.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install HtmlPurifier:** Install `yiisoft/yii2-htmlpurifier` extension via Composer: `composer require yiisoft/yii2-htmlpurifier`.
    2.  **Sanitize Output in Views:** In view files, use `yii\helpers\HtmlPurifier::process($output)` to sanitize output containing user-generated content before displaying it in HTML.
    3.  **Set `defaultHtmlEncode` in View Component:** Configure the `view` component in `config/web.php` or `config/main.php` to enable `defaultHtmlEncode: true` for automatic HTML-encoding by default.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):** Effectively prevents XSS attacks by sanitizing HTML output.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting: High
*   **Currently Implemented:** `HtmlPurifier` is used in `app\views\site\contact.php`. `defaultHtmlEncode` is set to `true` in `config/web.php`. Implemented in view layer and configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `HtmlPurifier` is not consistently applied across all views, especially in user profile pages (`app\views\user\profile.php`) and admin panels. Missing sanitization in API responses returning HTML content.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries and Active Record/Query Builder](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries_and_active_recordquery_builder.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Active Record for Database Interactions:** Primarily utilize Yii2's Active Record for database operations, which inherently use parameterized queries.
    2.  **Use Query Builder for Complex Queries:** Leverage Yii2's Query Builder for complex queries, also supporting parameter binding.
    3.  **Parameter Binding with Raw SQL (If Necessary):** If raw SQL is needed, use parameter binding with placeholders and `bindValues()`/`bindValue()` methods of the command object.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High):** Effectively prevents SQL injection attacks by treating user input as data, not SQL code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High
*   **Currently Implemented:** Active Record and Query Builder are used throughout the application in models and controllers. Parameterized queries are implicitly used. Implemented in model and controller layers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Refactor raw SQL queries in legacy code within `app\components\DataProcessor.php` to use parameterized queries or Query Builder.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable CSRF Validation in Configuration:** Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in `config/web.php` or `config/main.php` by setting `'enableCsrfValidation' => true` in the `request` component.
    2.  **Use `Html::beginForm()` or `ActiveForm::begin()` for Forms:** Use Yii2's `Html::beginForm()` or `ActiveForm::begin()` to generate forms, automatically including CSRF tokens.
    3.  **Handle AJAX Requests (If Necessary):** For AJAX requests modifying data, include the CSRF token from `Yii::$app->request->csrfToken` in headers or POST data.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High):** Prevents CSRF attacks by validating requests originate from legitimate users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery: High
*   **Currently Implemented:** CSRF validation is enabled in `config/web.php`. `ActiveForm::begin()` is used for most forms. Implemented in configuration and view layer.
*   **Missing Implementation:** CSRF token is not included in AJAX requests from custom JavaScript in the admin panel. AJAX calls need to be updated to include CSRF tokens.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Authentication and Authorization (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_authentication_and_authorization__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Authentication using Yii2's `User` Component:** Utilize Yii2's `User` component for authentication. Configure it in `config/web.php` or `config/main.php`, specifying the identity class. Implement authentication logic in the identity class and login/logout actions using `Yii::$app->user->login()` and `Yii::$app->user->logout()`. Use `Yii::$app->security` for password hashing.
    2.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Yii2's AuthManager:** Set up Yii2's AuthManager for RBAC in `config/web.php` or `config/main.php`. Define roles, permissions, and rules. Assign roles to users. Use `Yii::$app->user->can()` for authorization checks.
    3.  **Session Management Security:** Configure session settings in `config/web.php` or `config/main.php` within the `session` component. Set secure cookie parameters and consider session timeouts. Regenerate session IDs after login using `Yii::$app->session->regenerateID(true)`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High):** RBAC and authentication prevent unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Account Takeover (High):** Secure password storage and session management reduce account takeover risk.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium):** RBAC prevents privilege escalation through granular access control.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High
    *   Account Takeover: High
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic authentication using Yii2's `User` component and password hashing is implemented. Session cookies are set to `httpOnly: true`. Implemented in model, controller, configuration, and view layers.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Proper RBAC system using Yii2's AuthManager is missing. Access control is currently based on simple role checks. Session regeneration after login is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling and Debugging in Production](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling_and_debugging_in_production.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** Disable debug mode (`YII_DEBUG`) in production by setting `YII_DEBUG` to `false` in server environment variables or application entry point.
    2.  **Configure Error Handling in `config/web.php` or `config/main.php`:** Customize the `errorHandler` component. Set `errorAction` and configure error logging using the `log` component.
    3.  **Display Generic Error Pages in Production:** Render generic, user-friendly error pages in the error action (`site/error`) instead of detailed error messages.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Prevents attackers from gaining sensitive information through detailed error messages exposed in debug mode.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium
*   **Currently Implemented:** Debug mode is disabled in production. `errorHandler` is configured to use `'site/error'` action. Generic error page is displayed. Implemented in configuration and server environment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Integration with a dedicated error tracking system (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) is missing for more effective error monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Gii and Debug Toolbar Security](./mitigation_strategies/gii_and_debug_toolbar_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Gii in Production:** Disable Gii module in production by removing or commenting out its configuration in `config/web.php` or `config/main.php`.
    2.  **Disable Debug Toolbar in Production:** Disable the debug toolbar module in production by removing or commenting out its configuration in `config/web.php` or `config/main.php`.
    3.  **Restrict Access to Gii in Development/Staging (Optional):** Restrict access to Gii in development/staging using IP address restrictions or authentication in the Gii module configuration.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** Prevents exposure of sensitive information through Gii and debug toolbar in production.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (Low):** Eliminates potential RCE risk associated with Gii.
    *   **Unauthorized Code Generation/Modification (Medium):** Prevents misuse of Gii for code manipulation in production.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium
    *   Remote Code Execution: Low
    *   Unauthorized Code Generation/Modification: Medium
*   **Currently Implemented:** Gii and debug toolbar modules are commented out in `config/web.php` for production. Disabled in production configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Access to Gii is not restricted in the development environment. IP address restrictions or authentication should be implemented for Gii in development and staging.
