### 4. Deep Analysis of "Insecure Use of Query Builders or Raw SQL" Threat

#### 4.1. Threat Explanation

The "Insecure Use of Query Builders or Raw SQL" threat highlights a critical vulnerability in web applications, especially those utilizing frameworks like Yii2. While Yii2 provides robust tools like the Query Builder and Active Record to abstract away direct SQL interactions and inherently offer protection against SQL injection, developers can inadvertently bypass these protections by:

*   **Using Raw SQL Queries:**  Opting for raw SQL queries (`Yii::$app->db->createCommand()`) when the Query Builder or Active Record could be used securely. Raw SQL, if not handled carefully, directly exposes the application to SQL injection risks.
*   **Improperly Using Query Builder/Active Record:**  Even when using the Query Builder or Active Record, developers can introduce vulnerabilities by:
    *   **Directly concatenating user input into query conditions or values.**
    *   **Failing to use parameter binding correctly when using raw SQL within Query Builder methods.**
    *   **Overlooking edge cases or complex query scenarios where input sanitization or parameterization is missed.**

The core issue is the failure to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied data before incorporating it into SQL queries. When untrusted data is directly embedded into SQL statements, attackers can inject malicious SQL code that alters the intended query logic, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even complete system compromise.

#### 4.2. Vulnerable Scenarios and Code Examples

Let's illustrate vulnerable scenarios with code examples in Yii2:

**Scenario 1: Raw SQL with Direct User Input Concatenation (Highly Vulnerable)**

```php
// Controller action - potentially vulnerable
public function actionSearchRawSql($keyword)
{
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%" . $keyword . "%'"; // Vulnerable!
    $products = Yii::$app->db->createCommand($sql)->queryAll();

    return $this->render('search-results', ['products' => $products]);
}
```

**Explanation:** In this example, the `$keyword` parameter, directly taken from user input (e.g., query parameter in a GET request), is concatenated directly into the SQL query string. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code within the `$keyword` to manipulate the query.

**Example Attack:**  If an attacker provides the following as `$keyword`:

```
%'; DELETE FROM products; --
```

The resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%%'; DELETE FROM products; --%';
```

This injected code will:

1.  Terminate the `LIKE` clause prematurely (`%';`).
2.  Execute a `DELETE FROM products;` statement, potentially deleting all product data.
3.  Comment out the rest of the original query (`--%`).

**Scenario 2: Insecure Query Builder Usage - Direct Input in `where()` condition (Vulnerable)**

```php
// Controller action - potentially vulnerable
public function actionSearchQueryBuilder($keyword)
{
    $products = Product::find()
        ->where("name LIKE '%" . $keyword . "%'") // Vulnerable!
        ->all();

    return $this->render('search-results', ['products' => $products]);
}
```

**Explanation:**  While using the Query Builder, this example still concatenates user input directly into the `where()` condition as a raw string. This bypasses the Query Builder's intended parameterization and remains vulnerable to SQL injection, similar to raw SQL concatenation.

**Scenario 3:  Subtle Vulnerability - Incorrect Parameter Binding in Raw SQL within Query Builder (Less Obvious but Still Vulnerable)**

```php
// Controller action - potentially vulnerable
public function actionSearchQueryBuilderRawSql($keyword)
{
    $products = Product::findBySql("SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%" . $keyword . "%'") // Vulnerable!
        ->all();

    return $this->render('search-results', ['products' => $products]);
}
```

**Explanation:** Even when using `findBySql()` which is part of Active Record and uses Query Builder internally, directly embedding the `$keyword` into the raw SQL string makes it vulnerable.  While `findBySql()` *can* be used securely with parameter binding, this example misses that crucial step.

#### 4.3. Attack Vectors and Exploitation

Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through various input channels, including:

*   **GET/POST Request Parameters:**  Manipulating URL parameters or form data submitted by users.
*   **Cookies:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities through data stored in cookies.
*   **Headers:**  Less common but potentially exploitable through HTTP headers if processed and used in queries.
*   **Uploaded Files (Indirectly):**  If file content or metadata is processed and used in database queries without proper sanitization.

**Exploitation Steps (General SQL Injection):**

1.  **Identify Input Points:** Attackers identify parts of the application that take user input and use it in database queries.
2.  **Test for Vulnerability:** They inject special characters (e.g., single quotes, double quotes, semicolons) and SQL keywords (e.g., `UNION`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`) to observe how the application responds and if errors occur, indicating potential SQL injection.
3.  **Craft Malicious Payloads:** Once a vulnerability is confirmed, attackers craft more sophisticated SQL injection payloads to:
    *   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization:**  Gain access to restricted data or functionality.
    *   **Extract Sensitive Data:**  Retrieve usernames, passwords, credit card details, personal information, etc.
    *   **Modify Data:**  Alter records, change user permissions, inject malicious content.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Execute resource-intensive queries to slow down or crash the application.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (in some advanced scenarios):**  Potentially gain control over the database server or even the web server in highly vulnerable configurations (less common in modern setups but still a theoretical risk).

#### 4.4. Impact of Successful Exploitation

Successful exploitation of "Insecure Use of Query Builders or Raw SQL" can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Modification or deletion of critical data, causing business disruption, data integrity issues, and potential financial losses.
*   **Account Takeover:**  Gaining access to user accounts, potentially leading to further malicious activities and data breaches.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Elevating privileges to administrator level, granting complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **System Compromise:**  In extreme cases, attackers might be able to gain control over the database server or even the web server, leading to complete system compromise and significant damage.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and damage to brand reputation due to security breaches.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Penalties:**  Fines and legal actions due to non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Given these severe potential impacts, the **Risk Severity** is rightly classified as **Critical to High**.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

To effectively mitigate the "Insecure Use of Query Builders or Raw SQL" threat in Yii2 applications, developers should diligently implement the following strategies:

**4.5.1. Primarily Use Query Builder and Active Record:**

*   **Explanation:** Yii2's Query Builder and Active Record are designed to abstract away direct SQL construction and inherently promote secure query building through parameter binding. They should be the primary tools for database interactions.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Favor Query Builder for complex queries and data retrieval operations.
    *   Utilize Active Record for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database tables, leveraging its built-in validation and security features.
    *   Avoid resorting to raw SQL unless absolutely necessary for highly specific or complex queries that cannot be effectively constructed using Query Builder or Active Record.

**Example (Secure Query Builder):**

```php
// Controller action - Secure Query Builder usage
public function actionSearchSecureQueryBuilder($keyword)
{
    $products = Product::find()
        ->where(['like', 'name', $keyword]) // Secure: Parameterized condition
        ->all();

    return $this->render('search-results', ['products' => $products]);
}
```

**Explanation:**  The `where(['like', 'name', $keyword])` syntax in Yii2's Query Builder automatically uses parameter binding. The `$keyword` is treated as a parameter, not directly embedded into the SQL string, preventing SQL injection.

**4.5.2. Always Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements:**

*   **Explanation:** Parameterized queries (or prepared statements) are the cornerstone of SQL injection prevention. They separate the SQL query structure from the user-supplied data. Placeholders are used in the SQL query, and the actual data is passed separately as parameters. The database system then handles the data correctly, ensuring it's treated as data, not executable SQL code.
*   **Implementation in Yii2 (Raw SQL):**

```php
// Controller action - Secure Raw SQL with Parameter Binding
public function actionSearchSecureRawSql($keyword)
{
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE :keyword"; // Placeholder :keyword
    $products = Yii::$app->db->createCommand($sql)
        ->bindValues([':keyword' => '%' . $keyword . '%']) // Bind parameter
        ->queryAll();

    return $this->render('search-results', ['products' => $products]);
}
```

**Explanation:**
    *   `:keyword` is a placeholder in the SQL query.
    *   `bindValues([':keyword' => '%' . $keyword . '%'])` binds the `$keyword` value to the placeholder. Yii2's DB component handles the parameterization securely.

**4.5.3. Minimize or Eliminate Raw SQL Queries:**

*   **Explanation:** Raw SQL queries increase the risk of SQL injection because developers are responsible for manual parameterization, which can be easily overlooked or implemented incorrectly.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Prioritize using Query Builder and Active Record for most database operations.
    *   If raw SQL is unavoidable for complex queries, ensure meticulous parameterization using `bindValues()` or `bindParams()`.
    *   Thoroughly review raw SQL queries for potential vulnerabilities during code reviews.

**4.5.4. Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**

*   **Explanation:** While parameterization is the primary defense against SQL injection, input validation and sanitization act as an additional layer of security. Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and data types. Sanitize input by removing or encoding potentially harmful characters.
*   **Yii2 Validation:** Utilize Yii2's built-in validation rules in Models to enforce data integrity and reject invalid input before it reaches the database query stage.
*   **Sanitization Functions:**  Use PHP's sanitization functions (e.g., `htmlspecialchars()`, `filter_var()`) or Yii2's helpers (e.g., `yii\helpers\Html::encode()`) to encode potentially harmful characters in user input before displaying it or using it in non-database contexts. **Note:** Sanitization is primarily for output encoding (preventing XSS) and less effective as a primary SQL injection defense compared to parameterization. Validation is more relevant for SQL injection prevention by ensuring data type and format correctness.

**4.5.5. Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users:**

*   **Explanation:** Grant database users (used by the Yii2 application) only the necessary permissions required for the application to function. Avoid using database users with `root` or `DBA` privileges.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Create dedicated database users for the Yii2 application with limited permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` only on specific tables).
    *   Restrict access to sensitive database system tables and administrative functions.
    *   Regularly review and audit database user permissions.

**4.5.6. Code Reviews and Security Audits:**

*   **Explanation:** Implement regular code reviews by experienced developers to identify potential security vulnerabilities, including insecure SQL query construction. Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing by security professionals to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review Focus:**
    *   Specifically review all database interaction code for proper use of Query Builder, Active Record, and parameterization.
    *   Scrutinize any raw SQL queries for potential SQL injection risks.
    *   Verify input validation and sanitization practices.
*   **Security Audits/Penetration Testing:**
    *   Employ automated security scanning tools to detect common SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct manual penetration testing by security experts to simulate real-world attacks and identify more complex vulnerabilities.

#### 4.6. Testing and Validation Methods

To ensure the effectiveness of implemented mitigation strategies, developers should employ the following testing and validation methods:

1.  **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests specifically for database interaction logic. These tests should:
    *   Verify that queries are constructed using Query Builder or Active Record correctly.
    *   Confirm that parameter binding is used when necessary (especially with raw SQL).
    *   Test different input scenarios, including potentially malicious inputs, to ensure queries behave as expected and do not exhibit SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Perform integration tests that interact with a test database. These tests should:
    *   Simulate real-world application workflows involving database interactions.
    *   Verify that data is correctly inserted, updated, retrieved, and deleted without SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Test with various input data, including boundary cases and potentially malicious inputs.

3.  **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Manually test for SQL injection vulnerabilities by:
    *   Injecting various SQL injection payloads into input fields (e.g., search forms, login forms, URL parameters).
    *   Analyzing application responses and database logs for errors or unexpected behavior that might indicate successful SQL injection.
    *   Using specialized tools like SQLmap to automate SQL injection testing.

4.  **Automated Security Scanning:**  Utilize automated security scanning tools (SAST - Static Application Security Testing and DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing) to:
    *   Scan the application code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities (SAST).
    *   Scan the running application by sending malicious requests and analyzing responses (DAST).
    *   These tools can help identify common SQL injection patterns and vulnerabilities but should be complemented with manual testing for comprehensive coverage.

5.  **Code Reviews and Peer Reviews:**  As mentioned earlier, code reviews are crucial for catching potential vulnerabilities before they reach production. Peer reviews can provide an additional layer of validation.

By consistently applying these mitigation strategies and employing thorough testing and validation methods, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of "Insecure Use of Query Builders or Raw SQL" vulnerabilities in their Yii2 applications and protect them from potential SQL injection attacks.
