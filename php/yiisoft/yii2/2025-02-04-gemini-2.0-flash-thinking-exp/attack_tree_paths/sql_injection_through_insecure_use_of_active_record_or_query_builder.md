### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SQL Injection through Insecure Use of Active Record or Query Builder

#### 4.1 Introduction

The attack path "SQL Injection through insecure use of Active Record or Query Builder" highlights a common and critical vulnerability in web applications, especially those utilizing Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like Yii2's Active Record and Query Builder. While Yii2 provides robust mechanisms to prevent SQL Injection, developers can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities by bypassing these mechanisms or misusing the framework's features.

#### 4.2 Breakdown of the Attack Path

The attack path breakdown identifies three primary ways developers might introduce SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Yii2 applications using Active Record or Query Builder:

##### 4.2.1 Using Raw SQL Queries without Proper Parameterization

**How:** Developers might resort to using raw SQL queries directly via `Yii::$app->db->createCommand($rawSql)` for complex queries or when they perceive Query Builder to be insufficient. If these raw SQL queries are constructed using string concatenation with unsanitized user input, they become highly vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```php
use Yii;
use yii\web\Controller;

class SiteController extends Controller
{
    public function actionSearch($keyword)
    {
        $keyword = $_GET['keyword']; // User input from GET parameter (VULNERABLE)

        // Vulnerable raw SQL query using string concatenation
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%" . $keyword . "%'";
        $products = Yii::$app->db->createCommand($sql)->queryAll();

        return $this->render('search', ['products' => $products]);
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

In this example, the `$keyword` is directly taken from the `$_GET['keyword']` without any sanitization or parameterization. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `keyword` parameter.

**Example Attack Payload:**

If an attacker provides the following as the `keyword`:

```
%'; DROP TABLE products; --
```

The constructed SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%%'; DROP TABLE products; --%'
```

This query will:

1. Select all products (due to `LIKE '%%'`).
2. **Execute `DROP TABLE products;`**, potentially deleting the entire `products` table.
3. The `--` comments out the rest of the query, preventing syntax errors.

**Secure Approach (Using Parameterized Queries):**

```php
use Yii;
use yii\web\Controller;

class SiteController extends Controller
{
    public function actionSearch()
    {
        $keyword = Yii::$app->request->get('keyword'); // Get user input safely

        // Secure parameterized query
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE :keyword";
        $products = Yii::$app->db->createCommand($sql)
            ->bindValue(':keyword', '%' . $keyword . '%') // Parameter binding
            ->queryAll();

        return $this->render('search', ['products' => $products]);
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Secure Approach:**

By using `:keyword` as a placeholder and binding the user input `$keyword` using `bindValue()`, Yii2's database abstraction layer ensures that the input is treated as data, not as executable SQL code. The database driver handles escaping and quoting, preventing SQL Injection.

##### 4.2.2 Insecurely Concatenating User Input Directly into Query Builder Methods or Conditions

**How:** Even when using Query Builder or Active Record, developers might mistakenly concatenate user input directly into methods that expect strings, especially when constructing `WHERE` conditions or other clauses. This bypasses the intended parameterization mechanisms of Query Builder and Active Record.

**Example (Vulnerable Query Builder Code):**

```php
use Yii;
use yii\db\Query;
use yii\web\Controller;

class SiteController extends Controller
{
    public function actionSearch()
    {
        $username = Yii::$app->request->get('username'); // User input

        // Vulnerable Query Builder with string concatenation
        $query = new Query();
        $users = $query->select(['id', 'username', 'email'])
            ->from('users')
            ->where("username = '" . $username . "'") // VULNERABLE CONCATENATION
            ->all();

        return $this->render('search', ['users' => $users]);
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

Similar to raw SQL, concatenating `$username` directly into the `where()` clause creates a SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Example Attack Payload:**

Username:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

Constructed SQL (behind the scenes by Query Builder):

```sql
SELECT `id`, `username`, `email` FROM `users` WHERE username = ''' OR 1=1 --'
```

This will bypass the intended `WHERE` condition and return all users because `1=1` is always true, and `--` comments out the rest of the condition.

**Secure Approach (Using Parameterized Conditions in Query Builder):**

```php
use Yii;
use yii\db\Query;
use yii\web\Controller;

class SiteController extends Controller
{
    public function actionSearch()
    {
        $username = Yii::$app->request->get('username'); // User input

        // Secure Query Builder with parameterized conditions
        $query = new Query();
        $users = $query->select(['id', 'username', 'email'])
            ->from('users')
            ->where(['username' => $username]) // Parameterized condition
            ->all();

        return $this->render('search', ['users' => $users]);
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Secure Approach:**

By passing an array to the `where()` method (or other condition methods like `andWhere()`, `orWhere()`), Yii2 automatically handles parameterization. The key-value pair `['username' => $username]` is interpreted as a condition where `username` is the column name and `$username` is the value to be parameterized.

##### 4.2.3 Misusing Active Record Features in a Way that Allows Injection

**How:**  While Active Record is designed to be secure, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities if they misuse its features, particularly when dealing with dynamic conditions or attributes.  This often occurs when developers try to build complex dynamic queries and fall back to string manipulation instead of utilizing Active Record's built-in features correctly.

**Example (Vulnerable Active Record Code):**

```php
use app\models\Product;
use yii\web\Controller;

class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function actionView($id)
    {
        $id = $_GET['id']; // User input (VULNERABLE)

        // Vulnerable Active Record find with string concatenation in condition
        $product = Product::find()
            ->where("id = " . $id) // VULNERABLE CONCATENATION
            ->one();

        if ($product) {
            return $this->render('view', ['product' => $product]);
        } else {
            throw new \yii\web\NotFoundHttpException('Product not found.');
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

Directly concatenating `$id` into the `where()` condition in Active Record's `find()` method is vulnerable to SQL Injection, just like in Query Builder.

**Example Attack Payload:**

ID:

```
1 OR 1=1 --
```

Constructed SQL (behind the scenes by Active Record):

```sql
SELECT * FROM `product` WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1 --
```

This will likely return the first product in the table (or potentially all products depending on the database and table structure) due to the `1=1` condition.

**Secure Approach (Using Parameterized Conditions in Active Record):**

```php
use app\models\Product;
use yii\web\Controller;

class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function actionView()
    {
        $id = Yii::$app->request->get('id'); // Get user input safely

        // Secure Active Record find with parameterized condition
        $product = Product::findOne(['id' => $id]); // Parameterized condition

        if ($product) {
            return $this->render('view', ['product' => $product]);
        } else {
            throw new \yii\web\NotFoundHttpException('Product not found.');
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Secure Approach:**

Using `Product::findOne(['id' => $id])` or `Product::find()->where(['id' => $id])->one()` leverages Active Record's built-in parameterization.  Passing an array to `findOne()` or `where()` ensures that the values are properly escaped and treated as data.

#### 4.3 Impact of Successful Exploitation

A successful SQL Injection attack through insecure use of Active Record or Query Builder can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach (Confidentiality):** Attackers can read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and business secrets.
* **Data Manipulation (Integrity):** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption, loss of critical information, and disruption of application functionality.
* **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms by manipulating SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to administrative accounts or other user accounts.
* **Privilege Escalation:** In some database configurations, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges within the database system, potentially gaining control over the entire database server.
* **Command Execution (Availability & Integrity):** In the most severe cases, depending on database server configurations and permissions, attackers might be able to execute operating system commands on the database server, leading to complete system compromise, denial of service, and further attacks on the infrastructure.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

To prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Yii2 applications, developers should strictly adhere to the following mitigation strategies:

1. **Always Use Parameterized Queries:**
    * **For Raw SQL:** Utilize `bindValue()` or `bindParam()` when using `Yii::$app->db->createCommand($sql)`.
    * **For Query Builder and Active Record:**  Use array-based conditions in `where()`, `andWhere()`, `orWhere()`, `having()`, `andHaving()`, `orHaving()`, and `join()` methods. Avoid string concatenation within these methods.

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**
    * While parameterization is the primary defense against SQL Injection, implement input validation and sanitization as a secondary layer of defense.
    * Validate user input on the server-side to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths.
    * Sanitize input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters, although parameterization should still be the primary method for preventing SQL Injection. **Note:** Sanitization alone is often insufficient and can be bypassed, so rely primarily on parameterization.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users:**
    * Configure database user accounts used by the Yii2 application with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid granting excessive permissions like `DROP TABLE` or `EXECUTE` if not absolutely required. This limits the potential damage from a successful SQL Injection attack.

4. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses in the application code.
    * Use static analysis tools to automatically scan code for potential vulnerabilities.

5. **Stay Updated with Yii2 Security Best Practices:**
    * Regularly review the official Yii2 documentation and security advisories to stay informed about best practices and potential security updates.
    * Subscribe to Yii2 security mailing lists or forums to receive timely notifications about security issues.

6. **Use Yii2 Security Features:**
    * Leverage Yii2's built-in security features and components, such as input validation rules in models and security helpers.

### 5. Conclusion

SQL Injection through insecure use of Active Record or Query Builder is a serious vulnerability that can have devastating consequences for Yii2 applications. By understanding the common pitfalls of raw SQL queries, insecure string concatenation, and misuse of Active Record features, developers can proactively implement robust mitigation strategies.  **The cornerstone of preventing SQL Injection in Yii2 is consistently using parameterized queries provided by the framework's database abstraction layer.**  By adhering to secure coding practices, input validation, and regular security assessments, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection and build more secure Yii2 applications.
