### 4. Deep Analysis of Template Injection (Twig/PHP)

#### 4.1. What is Template Injection?

Template Injection is a server-side vulnerability that arises when user-controlled input is embedded into template code and then processed by a template engine without proper sanitization or escaping.  Instead of treating user input as pure data, the template engine interprets it as part of the template itself, potentially leading to:

*   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive server-side data or configuration.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Making requests to internal or external resources from the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Executing arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.

Template Injection is often compared to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), but it operates at the template engine level. It's particularly dangerous because it can bypass many common web application security measures designed to prevent other injection attacks.

#### 4.2. Template Injection in Twig/PHP within Yii2

Yii2, while not inherently using Twig, can easily integrate it through extensions like `yiisoft/yii2-twig`.  When Twig is used, developers can leverage its powerful templating features to dynamically generate web pages. However, improper handling of user input within Twig templates can lead to Template Injection vulnerabilities.

**How Twig is used in Yii2:**

In Yii2, controllers typically render views using methods like `render()` or `renderPartial()`. When using the Twig extension, these methods will utilize the Twig engine to process `.twig` files. Data is passed from the controller to the view as an array of variables.

**Vulnerable Scenarios in Yii2/Twig:**

The primary vulnerability arises when user-controlled input is directly or indirectly used within Twig template expressions without proper escaping or when constructing dynamic template paths based on user input.

**Common Attack Vectors:**

*   **Directly Embedding User Input in Template Expressions:**

    If user input is directly placed within Twig's expression delimiters `{{ ... }}` without proper escaping, it can be interpreted as Twig code.

    **Example (Vulnerable Code):**

    ```php
    // Controller action
    public function actionIndex($name)
    {
        return $this->render('index', [
            'userName' => $name, // User input from GET parameter 'name'
        ]);
    }
    ```

    ```twig
    {# View (index.twig) - VULNERABLE #}
    <h1>Hello, {{ userName }}!</h1>
    ```

    In this example, if a user provides input like `{{ 7*7 }}` for the `name` parameter, Twig will evaluate it and render "Hello, 49!".  A malicious attacker could inject more harmful Twig code.

*   **Dynamic Template Paths Based on User Input:**

    If the application dynamically constructs template paths based on user input, an attacker might be able to manipulate the path to include malicious Twig code or access unintended templates. This is less common in typical Yii2 applications but can occur in custom template loading logic.

    **Example (Hypothetical Vulnerable Code - Less Common in Yii2):**

    ```php
    // Controller action (Hypothetical - less typical Yii2 pattern)
    public function actionRenderTemplate($templateName)
    {
        $templatePath = Yii::getAlias('@app/views/dynamic/') . $templateName . '.twig'; // User input influences path
        return $this->renderFile($templatePath, []);
    }
    ```

    An attacker could potentially provide a `templateName` like `../../../../../../tmp/evil_template` if the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize the input, and if they can somehow place a malicious Twig file in `/tmp/evil_template.twig`.

#### 4.3. Vulnerability and Impact

A successful Template Injection attack in Yii2/Twig can have severe consequences:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  This is the most critical impact. Twig, like many template engines, has features that can be abused to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. Attackers can use Twig syntax to call PHP functions and system commands.

    **Example Exploitation (using the vulnerable `userName` example above):**

    An attacker could craft a URL like:

    `https://example.com/index?name={{ _self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback("system") }}{{ _self.env.getFilter("id") }}`

    This payload attempts to use Twig's features to register the PHP `system()` function as a filter and then execute the `id` command.  (Note: Specific payloads might vary depending on Twig version and configuration, and might require adjustments).

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use Twig syntax to access server-side variables, configuration files, environment variables, and potentially database credentials if they are accessible within the Twig environment.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  By manipulating Twig functions related to file access or network requests (if available and exploitable), attackers might be able to make requests to internal or external resources from the server, potentially bypassing firewalls or accessing internal services.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, attackers might be able to craft payloads that cause the template engine to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.

#### 4.4. Exploitation Scenario - Detailed Example

Let's consider the vulnerable `userName` example from section 4.2:

**Vulnerable Code (reiterated):**

```php
// Controller action
public function actionIndex($name)
{
    return $this->render('index', [
        'userName' => $name, // User input from GET parameter 'name'
    ]);
}
```

```twig
{# View (index.twig) - VULNERABLE #}
<h1>Hello, {{ userName }}!</h1>
```

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Identify the Vulnerability:** An attacker analyzes the application and notices that the `name` GET parameter is directly reflected in the rendered page within the `<h1>` tag. They suspect Template Injection.

2.  **Test for Template Injection:** The attacker tries injecting simple Twig expressions to confirm the vulnerability. They might try:

    *   `https://example.com/index?name={{ 7*7 }}` - If the page renders "Hello, 49!", it confirms Twig expression evaluation.
    *   `https://example.com/index?name={{ config.debug }}` (Hypothetical - depends on Twig context) -  They might try to access configuration variables to gather information.

3.  **Craft a Malicious Payload for RCE:**  Once Template Injection is confirmed, the attacker crafts a payload to achieve Remote Code Execution. A potential payload (as mentioned earlier, payloads can vary) could be:

    `https://example.com/index?name={{ _self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback("system") }}{{ _self.env.getFilter("id") }}`

4.  **Execute the Payload:** The attacker sends the crafted URL to the vulnerable application.

5.  **Verify RCE:** If the application is vulnerable and the payload is successful, the output of the `id` command (or any other command injected) might be visible in the response, or the attacker might be able to verify execution through other means (e.g., network monitoring, log analysis).

6.  **Escalate the Attack:**  With RCE achieved, the attacker can escalate the attack to:
    *   Gain a shell on the server.
    *   Read sensitive files (e.g., database configuration, application code).
    *   Modify data.
    *   Install malware.
    *   Pivot to other internal systems.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

Preventing Template Injection in Yii2/Twig applications is crucial. Here are key mitigation strategies:

*   **Principle of Least Privilege in Template Rendering:**

    *   **Avoid Passing Sensitive Data Directly to Templates:**  Minimize the amount of sensitive data (especially configuration or internal objects) passed directly to Twig templates. If possible, process and sanitize data in the controller before passing it to the view.
    *   **Restrict Template Functionality:**  If possible, configure Twig to disable or restrict access to potentially dangerous functions and filters that could be abused for code execution. (However, this might be complex and could break application functionality).

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Limited Effectiveness for SSTI):**

    *   While input validation and sanitization are essential for preventing other injection attacks, they are **less effective** against Template Injection.  It's extremely difficult to sanitize input in a way that prevents all possible malicious template expressions.
    *   **Do not rely solely on input sanitization to prevent Template Injection.**

*   **Output Encoding (Not Directly Applicable to SSTI Prevention):**

    *   Output encoding (like HTML escaping) is crucial for preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when displaying user input in HTML. However, it **does not prevent Server-Side Template Injection**. SSTI occurs *before* the output is rendered, at the template engine processing stage.

*   **Template Sandboxing and Auto-escaping (Twig's `autoescape`):**

    *   **Twig's `autoescape` feature:**  Twig's `autoescape` configuration can help mitigate *some* forms of template injection, particularly those aimed at XSS through template injection. When enabled, Twig automatically escapes output based on the context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
    *   **Limitations of `autoescape` for SSTI:** `autoescape` primarily focuses on preventing XSS. It might not prevent all forms of SSTI, especially those targeting RCE through Twig's more advanced features.  It's not a complete solution for SSTI prevention.

*   **Secure Coding Practices - Avoid User Input in Template Logic:**

    *   **The most effective mitigation is to avoid directly embedding user-controlled input into template expressions or template paths.**
    *   Treat user input as data to be displayed, not as code to be executed by the template engine.
    *   If you need to dynamically generate content based on user input, carefully design the logic to avoid direct concatenation of user input into template code. Use safe templating patterns and pre-defined template structures.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**

    *   While CSP doesn't directly prevent SSTI, it can limit the impact of successful exploitation, especially if the attacker attempts to inject client-side JavaScript through template injection. A strong CSP can restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and other browser behaviors, making it harder for attackers to leverage SSTI for client-side attacks.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically looking for Template Injection vulnerabilities in Yii2/Twig applications.  Manual code review and automated security scanning tools can help identify potential weaknesses.

*   **Keep Yii2 and Twig Extensions Up-to-Date:**

    *   Ensure that Yii2 framework and the Twig extension are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. Vulnerabilities are sometimes discovered and fixed in framework and library updates.

### 5. Conclusion

Template Injection in Yii2 applications using Twig is a serious vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution and complete system compromise.  While Twig offers features like `autoescape`, they are not a foolproof solution for preventing SSTI.

The most effective mitigation strategy is to adopt secure coding practices that **avoid directly embedding user-controlled input into template expressions or template paths.** Developers should treat user input as data and carefully design template logic to prevent unintended code execution.

Regular security audits, penetration testing, and staying updated with security best practices are crucial for identifying and mitigating Template Injection vulnerabilities in Yii2/Twig applications. Educating the development team about the risks and proper mitigation techniques is paramount to building secure applications.
