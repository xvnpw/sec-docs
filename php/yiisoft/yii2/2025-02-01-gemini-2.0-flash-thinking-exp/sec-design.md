    - Requirement: Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for enhanced security.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The framework should offer robust authorization mechanisms, including role-based access control (RBAC).
    - Requirement: Authorization should be consistently applied across all application components and functionalities.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The framework must provide comprehensive input validation capabilities to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied at multiple layers (client-side and server-side).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Secure cryptographic functions should be used for sensitive operations like password hashing and data encryption.
    - Requirement: Best practices for key management and secure storage of cryptographic keys should be followed.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For Yii2 framework itself: Maintaining the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the framework code and distribution packages. Ensuring the framework is secure and reliable for developers to build upon.
  - For applications built with Yii2: The critical business processes depend on the specific application. Generally, these include providing services to end-users, processing transactions, managing data, and maintaining business operations.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - For Yii2 framework itself: Source code is publicly available, but build artifacts and release processes need to be protected to ensure integrity and prevent supply chain attacks. Developer credentials and infrastructure access keys are highly sensitive.
  - For applications built with Yii2: Data sensitivity varies greatly depending on the application. It can range from publicly accessible content to highly sensitive personal data, financial information, or proprietary business data. The sensitivity level is determined by the application's purpose and the data it handles.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
