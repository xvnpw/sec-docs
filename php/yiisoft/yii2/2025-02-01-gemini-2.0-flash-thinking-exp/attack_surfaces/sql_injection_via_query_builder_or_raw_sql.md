### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: SQL Injection via Query Builder or Raw SQL

#### 4.1. Introduction to SQL Injection

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a critical web security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It occurs when user-supplied input is incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe manner, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This injected code can then be executed by the database, potentially leading to:

*   **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive data that the attacker is not authorized to view, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data within the database, leading to data corruption, loss of integrity, and disruption of application functionality.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to administrative panels or user accounts.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overloading the database server or manipulating queries to cause performance degradation or application crashes.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain database configurations and operating system environments, SQL Injection can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands on the database server or even the underlying operating system.

#### 4.2. SQL Injection in Yii2 Applications: The Illusion of Security

Yii2, like many modern frameworks, provides tools like Active Record and Query Builder that are designed to significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection. These tools encourage the use of parameterized queries and abstraction, making it easier for developers to write secure database interactions.

**However, Yii2 does not eliminate the risk entirely.** Developers can still introduce SQL Injection vulnerabilities if they:

*   **Resort to Raw SQL Queries:**  When developers bypass Query Builder and Active Record and use raw SQL queries directly via `Yii::$app->db->createCommand()`, they become responsible for manual input sanitization and parameterization. If this is not done correctly, SQL Injection vulnerabilities are highly likely.
*   **Misuse Query Builder or Active Record:** Even with Query Builder and Active Record, vulnerabilities can arise from:
    *   **String Concatenation in `where()` conditions:**  Directly concatenating user input into `where()` conditions instead of using parameter binding.
    *   **Insecure handling of `LIKE` clauses:**  Failing to properly escape or parameterize user input used in `LIKE` patterns.
    *   **Dynamic table or column names from user input (less common but possible):** While less frequent, constructing table or column names dynamically from user input without proper validation can also lead to vulnerabilities in specific scenarios.
*   **Complex or Custom Database Interactions:**  In scenarios requiring highly complex SQL queries or custom database functions, developers might be tempted to use raw SQL or more intricate Query Builder constructions, increasing the chance of errors and vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Vulnerable Areas in Yii2: Examples and Analysis

Let's examine specific vulnerable areas with Yii2 code examples:

**4.3.1. Raw SQL Queries:**

**Vulnerable Code Example (as provided in the attack surface description):**

```php
public function actionLogin()
{
    $username = Yii::$app->request->get('username');
    $password = Yii::$app->request->get('password');

    $user = Yii::$app->db->createCommand("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $username . "' AND password = '" . $password . "'")->queryOne();

    if ($user) {
        // Login successful
        Yii::$app->session->setFlash('success', 'Login successful!');
    } else {
        // Login failed
        Yii::$app->session->setFlash('error', 'Invalid username or password.');
    }

    return $this->render('login');
}
```

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

This code directly concatenates user input (`$username` and `$password`) into the SQL query string. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by providing crafted input.

**Example Attack:**

If an attacker provides the following username:

```
' OR '1'='1' --
```

The resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' --' AND password = 'password'
```

The `--` is a SQL comment, effectively commenting out the rest of the query. The condition `'1'='1'` is always true, causing the query to return the first user from the `users` table, bypassing authentication.

**4.3.2. Insecure Query Builder Usage (String Concatenation in `where()`):**

**Vulnerable Code Example:**

```php
public function actionSearchUsers()
{
    $searchKeyword = Yii::$app->request->get('keyword');

    $users = (new \yii\db\Query())
        ->select(['id', 'username', 'email'])
        ->from('users')
        ->where("username LIKE '%" . $searchKeyword . "%'") // Vulnerable concatenation
        ->all();

    return $this->render('search', ['users' => $users]);
}
```

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

While using Query Builder, the developer still uses string concatenation within the `where()` condition to incorporate the `$searchKeyword`. This is vulnerable to SQL Injection, especially with the `LIKE` operator.

**Example Attack:**

If an attacker provides the following keyword:

```
%'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

The resulting SQL query becomes (simplified for illustration):

```sql
SELECT id, username, email FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%%'; DROP TABLE users; --%'
```

This injected code attempts to drop the `users` table after the `LIKE` condition. While database permissions might prevent `DROP TABLE` in many scenarios, other malicious SQL commands could be injected.

**4.3.3. Insecure `LIKE` Clause Handling:**

Even when using parameter binding with Query Builder, incorrect handling of `LIKE` clauses can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Potentially Vulnerable Code (Incorrect escaping):**

```php
public function actionSearchUsers()
{
    $searchKeyword = Yii::$app->request->get('keyword');
    $escapedKeyword = str_replace(['%', '_'], ['\%', '\_'], $searchKeyword); // Incomplete escaping

    $users = (new \yii\db\Query())
        ->select(['id', 'username', 'email'])
        ->from('users')
        ->where(['like', 'username', $escapedKeyword]) // Using parameter binding, but escaping is flawed
        ->all();

    return $this->render('search', ['users' => $users]);
}
```

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

While this code attempts to escape `%` and `_` characters, it might be insufficient for all database systems or complex injection attempts.  Furthermore, relying on manual escaping can be error-prone.

**Example Attack (depending on database and escaping flaws):**

Attackers might find ways to bypass simple escaping or exploit database-specific behaviors to inject SQL code even with `LIKE` clauses.

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment

Successful SQL Injection attacks in Yii2 applications can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, leading to privacy violations, financial losses, and reputational damage.
*   **Data Manipulation and Loss:**  Attackers can modify or delete critical data, disrupting application functionality and potentially causing significant business impact.
*   **Account Takeover:**  By bypassing authentication, attackers can gain control of user accounts, including administrative accounts, allowing them to further compromise the application and system.
*   **System Compromise:** In worst-case scenarios, SQL Injection can be a stepping stone to gaining control of the database server or even the underlying operating system, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Security breaches due to SQL Injection can severely damage an organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to legal liabilities and regulatory fines, especially in industries subject to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

**Risk Severity: Critical** -  Due to the potential for widespread and severe impact, SQL Injection is consistently classified as a critical vulnerability.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies for Yii2 Applications

To effectively mitigate SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Yii2 applications, developers must adopt secure coding practices and leverage Yii2's built-in security features.

**4.5.1. Always Use Parameterized Queries or Bound Parameters:**

This is the **most crucial mitigation strategy**. Parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements or bound parameters) separate the SQL query structure from the user-supplied data. The database system treats the parameters as data values, not as executable SQL code, effectively preventing injection.

**Yii2 Implementation:**

*   **Query Builder:** Use the `params()` method or placeholders in `where()` conditions with parameter binding.

    **Secure Query Builder Example:**

    ```php
    public function actionLogin()
    {
        $username = Yii::$app->request->get('username');
        $password = Yii::$app->request->get('password');

        $user = (new \yii\db\Query())
            ->select(['*'])
            ->from('users')
            ->where('username = :username AND password = :password', [':username' => $username, ':password' => $password])
            ->one();

        // ... rest of the code ...
    }
    ```

    **OR (using array syntax for `where()`):**

    ```php
    $user = (new \yii\db\Query())
        ->select(['*'])
        ->from('users')
        ->where(['username' => $username, 'password' => $password])
        ->one();
    ```

*   **Active Record:** Active Record methods inherently use parameter binding. When using conditions with Active Record, ensure you are using array syntax or placeholders with parameters.

    **Secure Active Record Example:**

    ```php
    $username = Yii::$app->request()->get('username');
    $user = User::findOne(['username' => $username]); // Secure Active Record usage
    ```

**4.5.2. Avoid Raw SQL Queries Whenever Possible:**

Minimize the use of `Yii::$app->db->createCommand()` and raw SQL queries. Leverage Query Builder and Active Record as much as possible. These tools provide built-in protection against SQL Injection when used correctly.

**When Raw SQL is Necessary (Use with Extreme Caution):**

If raw SQL is absolutely unavoidable for complex queries or specific database features, **always** use parameter binding with `params()` or placeholders in `createCommand()`:

**Secure Raw SQL Example:**

```php
$userId = Yii::$app->request->get('userId');
$sql = "SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = :userId";
$profile = Yii::$app->db->createCommand($sql, [':userId' => $userId])->queryOne();
```

**4.5.3. Carefully Sanitize Input Used in `LIKE` Clauses (Parameterization is Preferred):**

When using `LIKE` clauses with user input, parameterization is still the best approach. Yii2's Query Builder handles escaping for `LIKE` clauses when using parameter binding correctly.

**Secure `LIKE` Clause Example (using Query Builder parameter binding):**

```php
public function actionSearchUsers()
{
    $searchKeyword = Yii::$app->request->get('keyword');

    $users = (new \yii\db\Query())
        ->select(['id', 'username', 'email'])
        ->from('users')
        ->where(['like', 'username', $searchKeyword]) // Secure LIKE with parameter binding
        ->all();

    return $this->render('search', ['users' => $users]);
}
```

**If manual escaping is absolutely necessary (less recommended):**

Use Yii2's database connection's `quoteValue()` method to properly escape values for `LIKE` clauses. However, parameterization is still preferred for clarity and security.

**4.5.4. Conduct Regular Code Reviews Focusing on Database Interactions:**

Implement regular code reviews, specifically focusing on code sections that interact with the database and construct SQL queries. Pay close attention to:

*   Any usage of raw SQL queries.
*   How user input is incorporated into `where()` conditions, `LIKE` clauses, and other query parts.
*   Ensure parameter binding is consistently used for all user-supplied data.
*   Look for any instances of string concatenation when building SQL queries.

**4.5.5. Security Testing and Vulnerability Scanning:**

Incorporate security testing into the development lifecycle. This includes:

*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Engage security experts to manually test the application for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize automated security scanning tools that can detect potential SQL Injection points.
*   **Static Code Analysis:** Employ static code analysis tools that can identify potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the codebase.

#### 4.6. Best Practices for Secure Database Interaction in Yii2

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the necessary permissions required for the application to function. Avoid using database accounts with excessive privileges.
*   **Input Validation:** While parameterization prevents SQL Injection, input validation is still important for data integrity and application logic. Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and constraints.
*   **Error Handling:** Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users in production environments. These messages can reveal sensitive information and aid attackers. Log errors securely for debugging purposes.
*   **Stay Updated:** Keep Yii2 framework and database drivers updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and improvements.
*   **Developer Training:** Provide developers with adequate training on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on SQL Injection prevention in Yii2.

By diligently implementing these mitigation strategies and adhering to best practices, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection vulnerabilities in their Yii2 applications and protect sensitive data and systems from potential attacks.
