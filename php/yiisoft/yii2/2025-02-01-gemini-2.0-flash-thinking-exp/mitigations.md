# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for yiisoft/yii2

## Mitigation Strategy: [Model Validation Rules (Yii2)](./mitigation_strategies/model_validation_rules__yii2_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Yii2 Model Validation:**  Within your Yii2 models, define validation rules in the `rules()` method for all attributes that receive user input.
    2.  **Employ Built-in Validators:** Leverage Yii2's extensive set of built-in validators (e.g., `required`, `string`, `integer`, `email`, `url`, `date`, `boolean`, `in`, `unique`) to enforce data integrity and format.
    3.  **Create Custom Validators:** For complex validation logic specific to your application, define custom validation functions or methods within your models and reference them in the `rules()`.
    4.  **Ensure Validation Execution:** Yii2's Active Record automatically triggers validation before saving. For manual input handling, explicitly call `$model->validate()` before processing user data.
    5.  **Handle Validation Errors using Yii2:** Use `$model->getErrors()` to retrieve validation errors and display them to the user using Yii2's view mechanisms or API response formats.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - By ensuring data types and formats are validated before database queries.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity) - By validating input and preventing injection of malicious scripts through input fields.
        *   Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity) - By enforcing data constraints and formats defined in models.
        *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity) - When combined with `safeAttributes()`, prevents unintended attribute modification.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   SQL Injection: High Reduction
        *   Cross-Site Scripting: Medium Reduction
        *   Data Integrity Issues: High Reduction
        *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities: Medium Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Model validation is used for basic input fields in many forms, leveraging Yii2's built-in validators.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Custom validators are needed for more complex business logic and data constraints in several models.
        *   Validation rules need to be consistently applied across all models and input points, including API endpoints.
        *   Review and enhance existing validation rules to cover a wider range of potential threats.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Attributes in Active Record (Yii2)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_attributes_in_active_record__yii2_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define `safeAttributes()` in Yii2 Models:** In each Yii2 Active Record model, implement the `safeAttributes()` method.
    2.  **List Allowed Attributes:** Within `safeAttributes()`, return an array containing only the attributes that are explicitly permitted to be mass-assigned via user input or external data.
    3.  **Restrict Mass Assignment:** By defining `safeAttributes()`, Yii2 will prevent mass assignment of any attributes not listed, protecting against unintended modifications.
    4.  **Regularly Review `safeAttributes()`:**  As models evolve, regularly review and update the `safeAttributes()` method to ensure it accurately reflects which attributes should be mass-assignable.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating model attributes they should not be able to modify through malicious input.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities: High Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `safeAttributes()` is defined in some key models, but not consistently across all Active Record models.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implement `safeAttributes()` in all Active Record models, especially those handling user input or data from external sources.
        *   Establish a process to review and update `safeAttributes()` whenever model attributes are changed or added.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTMLPurifier for Rich Text Input (Yii2 Extension)](./mitigation_strategies/htmlpurifier_for_rich_text_input__yii2_extension_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install `yii2-htmlpurifier`:** Install the official Yii2 HTMLPurifier extension using Composer: `composer require yiisoft/yii2-htmlpurifier`.
    2.  **Configure `HtmlPurifier` Component (Yii2):** Configure the `htmlPurifier` component in your Yii2 application configuration (e.g., `config/web.php`). Customize settings like allowed tags, attributes, and CSS properties as needed.
    3.  **Sanitize Output with `HtmlPurifier::process()` (Yii2):** In your Yii2 views, use `HtmlPurifier::process($richTextInput)` to sanitize rich text input before displaying it. This will remove or encode potentially harmful HTML.
    4.  **Consider Input Sanitization (Yii2):** For enhanced security, sanitize rich text input using `HtmlPurifier::process()` *before* saving it to the database, in your Yii2 controllers or models.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity) - Effectively prevents XSS attacks from user-provided rich text content by sanitizing HTML.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting: High Reduction (specifically for rich text input)

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Rich text input is displayed without sanitization in areas like blog comments and user profiles.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Install and configure the `yii2-htmlpurifier` extension.
        *   Implement `HtmlPurifier::process()` in Yii2 views where rich text is displayed.
        *   Consider input-side sanitization within Yii2 controllers or models before database storage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Output Encoding with Yii2 Helpers](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_output_encoding_with_yii2_helpers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Output Points in Yii2 Views:** Locate all instances in your Yii2 views, layouts, and API responses where user-provided data is outputted.
    2.  **Use `Html::encode()` for Plain Text (Yii2):** For displaying plain text user input in HTML, use `\yii\helpers\Html::encode($userInput)`. This escapes HTML special characters, preventing XSS.
    3.  **Use `Html::tag()` and Encoding for Attributes (Yii2):** When outputting user input within HTML attributes, use `\yii\helpers\Html::tag()` or other Yii2 HTML helper methods that handle attribute encoding.
    4.  **Use `Url::encode()` for URLs (Yii2):** When constructing URLs with user input, use `\yii\helpers\Url::encode($userInput)` or `urlencode()` to properly encode URL parameters and prevent URL injection.
    5.  **Use `json_encode()` for JavaScript Output (Yii2/PHP):** If user data must be output in JavaScript, use `json_encode($userInput)` to safely encode data for JavaScript consumption.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity) - Prevents XSS by ensuring user data is encoded based on the output context (HTML, JavaScript, URL) using Yii2 helpers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting: High Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `Html::encode()` is used in many views, but not consistently for all user-provided data output.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematically review all Yii2 views and layouts to ensure `Html::encode()` or appropriate encoding is used for *all* user-provided data.
        *   Pay specific attention to encoding user input within HTML attributes and JavaScript code in Yii2 views.
        *   Train developers on context-aware output encoding using Yii2 helpers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Yii2 AuthManager](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__with_yii2_authmanager.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Yii2 AuthManager:** Configure the `authManager` component in your Yii2 application configuration (e.g., `config/web.php`). Choose a database-based storage for RBAC data.
    2.  **Define Roles and Permissions (Yii2 AuthManager):** Use Yii2's AuthManager API (or database migrations/seeders) to define roles (e.g., 'admin', 'editor', 'author') and permissions (e.g., 'createPost', 'updatePost', 'deletePost').
    3.  **Assign Permissions to Roles (Yii2 AuthManager):** Associate permissions with roles using Yii2's AuthManager, defining what actions each role is allowed to perform.
    4.  **Assign Roles to Users (Yii2 AuthManager):** Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities using Yii2's AuthManager.
    5.  **Implement Access Checks with `Yii::$app->user->can()` (Yii2):** In your Yii2 controllers and views, use `Yii::$app->user->can('permissionName')` to check if the current user has the required permission to access resources or perform actions.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) - Prevents users from accessing functionalities or data they are not authorized to access, using Yii2's RBAC system.
        *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of users gaining elevated privileges beyond their assigned roles within the Yii2 application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access: High Reduction
        *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic user roles exist, but granular permissions and consistent RBAC enforcement using Yii2's AuthManager are lacking.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Design a comprehensive RBAC structure with granular permissions using Yii2's AuthManager.
        *   Define and assign permissions to roles using Yii2's AuthManager API.
        *   Implement access checks using `Yii::$app->user->can()` in Yii2 controllers and views throughout the application.
        *   Extend RBAC to cover API endpoints and background tasks within the Yii2 application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Protection and Form Handling (Yii2)](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_protection_and_form_handling__yii2_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify CSRF Protection Enabled (Yii2):** Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in your Yii2 application configuration (`components.request.enableCsrfValidation = true`). This is enabled by default in Yii2.
    2.  **Use `ActiveForm` Widget (Yii2):** Utilize Yii2's `ActiveForm` widget for form creation. It automatically handles CSRF token generation and validation.
    3.  **Use `Html::csrfMetaTags()` for Manual Forms/AJAX (Yii2):** If not using `ActiveForm` or for AJAX requests, include `\yii\helpers\Html::csrfMetaTags()` in your Yii2 layout or form to generate CSRF meta tags.
    4.  **Handle CSRF Token in AJAX Requests (Yii2/JavaScript):** For AJAX requests modifying data, retrieve the CSRF token from the meta tag (`$('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr("content")`) and include it in the request headers or data.
    5.  **Avoid Bypassing Yii2 CSRF Protection:** Do not implement custom form handling that circumvents Yii2's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High Severity) - Prevents CSRF attacks by leveraging Yii2's built-in CSRF protection.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Request Forgery: High Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** CSRF protection is enabled in Yii2 configuration. `ActiveForm` is used for many forms.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Verify CSRF token handling for all AJAX requests that modify data within the Yii2 application.
        *   Review custom form handling logic to ensure proper CSRF protection if `ActiveForm` is not used in specific Yii2 components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [File Upload Security (Yii2)](./mitigation_strategies/file_upload_security__yii2_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `UploadedFile` and File Validators (Yii2):** In Yii2 controllers, use `\yii\web\UploadedFile::getInstance()` to handle file uploads. In Yii2 models, use file validators (e.g., `file`, `image`) in `rules()` to validate file types, sizes, and extensions server-side.
    2.  **Whitelist File Types and Extensions (Yii2 Validators):** Strictly whitelist allowed file types and extensions using Yii2's file validators.
    3.  **Limit File Size (Yii2 Validators):** Enforce file size limits using Yii2's file validators to prevent DoS attacks.
    4.  **Store Files Outside Webroot (Yii2 Configuration):** Configure your Yii2 application to store uploaded files in a directory outside the webroot. Use Yii2's path aliases and file system components for secure storage management.
    5.  **Generate Unique Filenames (Yii2 Application Logic):** Implement logic within your Yii2 application to generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
