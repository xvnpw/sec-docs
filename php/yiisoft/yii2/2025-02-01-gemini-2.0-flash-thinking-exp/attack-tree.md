## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exposed Configuration Files -> Application Takeover (High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exposed Configuration Files, Application Takeover, Application Compromise)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exposed_configuration_files_-_application_takeover__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exposed_config_ecab9e9b.md)

**Attack Vector:** Web server misconfiguration allowing direct access to configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config/web.php`).
*   **Steps:**
    *   Attacker identifies publicly accessible configuration files by trying common paths.
    *   Attacker accesses and downloads the configuration files.
    *   Attacker extracts sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and secret keys.
    *   Attacker uses these credentials to compromise the database, APIs, or gain administrative access to the application, leading to full application takeover.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full application compromise, data breach, potential infrastructure compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure configuration files are not within the web server's document root.
    *   Use environment variables to manage sensitive configuration outside of files.
    *   Implement strict web server access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Vulnerabilities in Yii2 Core Components -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities -> Application Compromise (High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in Yii2 Core Components, Exploit Known Vulnerabilities, Exploit identified vulnerability, Application Compromise)](./attack_tree_paths/2__vulnerabilities_in_yii2_core_components_-_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_-_application_compromise__0f69ce6d.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the Yii2 framework itself.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Attacker identifies the Yii2 version used by the application (e.g., via headers, error messages).
    *   Attacker searches for known vulnerabilities (CVEs, security advisories) for that specific Yii2 version.
    *   Attacker finds a relevant vulnerability (e.g., Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
    *   Attacker crafts an exploit and targets the application to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   Successful exploitation leads to application compromise, potentially including Remote Code Execution, data breach, or other malicious outcomes.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical - Depending on the vulnerability, can lead to Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, data breach, and full application compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update Yii2 framework to the latest stable version.
    *   Apply security patches promptly.
    *   Subscribe to Yii2 security advisories to stay informed about vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Vulnerabilities in Yii2 Extensions -> Exploit identified vulnerability in extension -> Application Compromise (High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in Yii2 Extensions, Exploit identified vulnerability in extension, Application Compromise)](./attack_tree_paths/3__vulnerabilities_in_yii2_extensions_-_exploit_identified_vulnerability_in_extension_-_application__bf8bc613.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party Yii2 extensions used by the application.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Attacker identifies the Yii2 extensions used by the application (e.g., by analyzing `composer.json` or application code).
    *   Attacker searches for known vulnerabilities in these specific extensions (e.g., in extension's repository, CVE databases).
    *   Attacker finds a vulnerability in a used extension (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Remote Code Execution).
    *   Attacker crafts an exploit targeting the vulnerable extension component within the application.
    *   Successful exploitation leads to application compromise, similar to exploiting core Yii2 vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical - Depending on the vulnerability and the extension's role, can lead to Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, data breach, and full application compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update Yii2 extensions to the latest stable versions.
    *   Apply security patches for extensions promptly.
    *   Carefully evaluate and audit third-party extensions before using them.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for used extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. SQL Injection via Active Record Misuse -> SQL Injection vulnerability -> Application Compromise (High-Risk Path & Critical Node: SQL Injection via Active Record Misuse, SQL Injection vulnerability, Application Compromise)](./attack_tree_paths/4__sql_injection_via_active_record_misuse_-_sql_injection_vulnerability_-_application_compromise__hi_b8006fb8.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Introducing SQL Injection vulnerabilities through improper use of Yii2's Active Record or by writing raw SQL queries without proper parameterization.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Attacker identifies application code that uses raw SQL queries or unsafe Active Record methods (e.g., direct concatenation of user input in queries).
    *   Attacker crafts malicious SQL input designed to manipulate the intended SQL query.
    *   Attacker injects this malicious SQL input through user-controllable parameters (e.g., form fields, URL parameters).
    *   The application executes the modified SQL query, leading to SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *   Attacker can then extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or in some database configurations, even achieve Remote Code Execution.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical - Data breach, data manipulation, potential Remote Code Execution in some database setups, and full application compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries or Active Record's query builder with placeholders for user input.
    *   Avoid writing raw SQL queries whenever possible.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on database interaction points.
    *   Use static analysis tools to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. File Upload Vulnerabilities -> Remote Code Execution -> Application Compromise (High-Risk Path & Critical Node: File Upload Vulnerabilities, Remote Code Execution, Application Compromise)](./attack_tree_paths/5__file_upload_vulnerabilities_-_remote_code_execution_-_application_compromise__high-risk_path_&_cr_7c0b787c.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting insecure file upload functionalities to upload and execute malicious files, leading to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Attacker identifies file upload functionalities in the application.
    *   Attacker attempts to bypass file type validation mechanisms (e.g., using magic bytes, double extensions, content-type manipulation).
    *   Attacker successfully uploads a malicious file, such as a web shell (e.g., PHP, JSP, ASPX) or an executable file.
    *   If the uploaded file is placed in a publicly accessible directory and the server is configured to execute it, the attacker can access the malicious file through a web request.
    *   Executing the malicious file (e.g., web shell) grants the attacker Remote Code Execution on the server, allowing for full application and potentially server compromise.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical - Remote Code Execution, full server and application compromise, data breach, and system takeover.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust file upload validation:
        *   Validate file type based on content (magic bytes) and not just file extensions.
        *   Use allowlists for allowed file types.
        *   Limit file size.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root.
    *   Store uploaded files in non-executable directories.
    *   Implement file scanning for malware upon upload.

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying PHP runtime environment.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Attacker identifies the PHP version used by the application (e.g., via headers, error messages, server probing).
    *   Attacker searches for known vulnerabilities (CVEs, security advisories) for that specific PHP version.
    *   Attacker finds a relevant PHP vulnerability (often Remote Code Execution or privilege escalation).
    *   Attacker crafts an exploit and targets the application to trigger the PHP vulnerability.
    *   Successful exploitation of a PHP vulnerability can lead to Remote Code Execution at the system level, allowing for full server and application compromise.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution at the system level, full server and application compromise, data breach, and system takeover.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update PHP to the latest stable version.
    *   Apply security patches for PHP promptly.
    *   Subscribe to PHP security advisories to stay informed about vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process for PHP and underlying dependencies.

    *   Attacker finds a vulnerability in a library used by the application (e.g., Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, other vulnerabilities depending on the library).
    *   Attacker crafts an exploit targeting the vulnerable library component within the application's context.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to application compromise, potentially including Remote Code Execution, data breach, or other malicious outcomes, depending on the nature of the library and the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical - Depending on the vulnerability and the affected library, can lead to Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, data breach, and full application compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update all dependencies, including indirect dependencies, using Composer.
    *   Use security auditing tools (e.g., `composer audit`) to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to continuously monitor and manage vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for libraries used in the project.
