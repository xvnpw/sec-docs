## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Debug Mode Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_debug_mode_misconfiguration__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage the Yii2 debug mode, which is often accidentally left enabled in production environments. This mode exposes sensitive information and tools that can be used for further exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1. Access Debug Toolbar [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker accesses the Yii2 debug toolbar, a web-based interface providing detailed information about the application's execution.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Attempt to access the debug toolbar URL (typically `/debug/default/index`).
            2.  If successful, proceed to exploit the toolbar's features.
        *   **1.1.1. Enumerate Application Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses the debug toolbar to view the application's configuration, including database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Navigate to the configuration section of the debug toolbar.
                2.  Extract sensitive information.
        *   **1.1.2. View Request/Response Data:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker examines request and response data, potentially revealing session tokens, user data, or other sensitive information.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Use the toolbar to inspect requests and responses.
                2.  Identify and extract sensitive data.
        *   **1.1.3. Execute Arbitrary Code [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** If the debug toolbar includes features like database query execution or code evaluation, the attacker uses these to execute arbitrary code on the server.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Identify code execution features within the toolbar.
                2.  Craft and execute malicious code.
        *   **1.1.4. Leverage Profiling Information:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses profiling data (e.g., execution times) to identify potential vulnerabilities or perform timing attacks.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Analyze profiling data from the toolbar.
                2.  Use the information to plan further attacks.
    *   **1.2. Access Gii Code Generator [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker accesses the Gii code generator, a tool for generating Yii2 code (models, controllers, CRUD operations).  If enabled in production, it's a major security risk.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Attempt to access the Gii URL (typically `/gii`).
            2.  If successful, proceed to generate malicious code.
        *   **1.2.1. Generate Malicious Code [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses Gii to generate malicious models, controllers, or CRUD operations that grant unauthorized access or perform other malicious actions.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Use Gii's interface to generate code.
                2.  Embed malicious logic within the generated code.
        *   **1.2.2. Overwrite Existing Files [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses Gii to overwrite existing application files with malicious code.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Use Gii to generate code that overwrites existing files.
                2.  Include malicious code in the generated output.
        *   **1.2.3. Expose Sensitive Data:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses Gii to generate views that expose sensitive data.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Use Gii to generate views.
                2.  Configure the views to display sensitive information.
    *   **1.3. Access Yii2 Log Files:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to Yii2's log files, which may contain sensitive information if improperly configured.
        *   **Steps:**
            1. Attempt to access log files directly via URL or other means.
            2. If successful, analyze the log files.
        *   **1.3.1 Extract Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker extracts sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) that has been inadvertently logged.
            *   **Steps:**
                1.  Search the log files for sensitive data.
                2.  Extract the identified information.

    *   **2.2.1. Exploit Misconfigured RBAC Rules:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker takes advantage of overly permissive RBAC rules that grant unintended access to resources or actions.
        *   **Steps:**
            1.  Identify accessible actions or resources.
