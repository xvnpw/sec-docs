# Threat Model Analysis for yiisoft/yii2

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

- Description: An attacker might craft malicious requests containing parameters that map to model attributes not intended for public modification. The **Yii2 framework**, if not configured correctly, will automatically assign these values, potentially modifying sensitive data in the database. For example, an attacker could modify the `is_admin` flag of a user account.
- Impact: Unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, data corruption.
- Affected Component: `yii\db\ActiveRecord` (specifically the model's attribute assignment mechanism).
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Define safe attributes using the `safe` validation rule in the model's `rules()` method.
  - Use the `load()` method with a specific form name or no form name to control which attributes are loaded.
  - Explicitly set attributes instead of relying on mass assignment for sensitive fields.

## Threat: [Unvalidated Input in Query Builders leading to SQL Injection](./threats/unvalidated_input_in_query_builders_leading_to_sql_injection.md)

- Description: An attacker might manipulate user input that is directly incorporated into database queries built using **Yii2's query builder** without proper parameter binding or escaping. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. For example, a search functionality that directly uses user input in a `WHERE` clause without proper sanitization.
- Impact: Data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, potential remote code execution depending on database permissions.
- Affected Component: `yii\db\Query`, `yii\db\Command` (when using raw SQL or improperly parameterized queries).
- Risk Severity: Critical
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Always use parameter binding or named parameters when incorporating user input into database queries.** **Yii2's query builder** provides methods like `params()` and named placeholders for this purpose.
  - Avoid direct string concatenation when building SQL queries with user input.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

- Description: An attacker might provide serialized data to the application, which, when unserialized by **Yii2**, could lead to the instantiation of arbitrary objects. If these objects have magic methods (like `__wakeup` or `__destruct`) with malicious code, it can result in remote code execution. This can occur if the application stores serialized data in cookies or sessions without proper integrity checks.
- Impact: Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
- Affected Component: `serialize()`, `unserialize()` (PHP functions used by **Yii2 components** or directly by developers).
- Risk Severity: Critical
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Avoid unserializing data from untrusted sources.**
  - If unserialization is necessary, use signature verification or encryption to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the serialized data.
  - Be aware of potential vulnerabilities in classes that might be unserialized.

## Threat: [Insecure Session Management](./threats/insecure_session_management.md)

- Description: An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in session handling to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This could involve session fixation (forcing a user to use a known session ID), session hijacking (stealing a valid session ID), or predicting session IDs if they are generated insecurely by **Yii2's session component**.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to user accounts, impersonation, data theft.
- Affected Component: `yii\web\Session`.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Use HTTPS to protect session cookies from interception.**
  - Configure `httponly` and `secure` flags for session cookies.
  - Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation.
  - Implement measures to detect and prevent session hijacking (e.g., tracking IP addresses or user agents).
  - Consider using a secure session storage mechanism.

## Threat: [Insufficient Data Sanitization in Views leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/insufficient_data_sanitization_in_views_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

- Description: An attacker might inject malicious scripts into data that is displayed in the application's views without proper escaping. When other users view this content, the malicious script will execute in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting them to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf. This is particularly relevant when developers bypass **Yii2's default escaping mechanisms**.
- Impact: Account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, information theft.
- Affected Component: `yii\web\View`, template rendering engine (e.g., PHP or Twig).
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Always escape output data in views using Yii2's HTML encoding helpers (e.g., `Html::encode()`).**
  - Be cautious when using raw output or bypassing encoding for specific purposes.
  - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

- Description: An attacker might upload malicious files to the server if the file upload mechanism, often implemented using **Yii2's features for handling requests**, is not properly secured. This could include web shells that allow remote code execution, or files that can be used in other attacks. For example, uploading an executable file to a publicly accessible directory.
- Impact: Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches, defacement.
- Affected Component: Controllers handling file uploads, file storage mechanisms.
- Risk Severity: Critical
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Validate file types and extensions on the server-side.** Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
  - Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.
  - Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible.
  - Implement file size limits.
  - Scan uploaded files for malware if feasible.
  - Configure web server to prevent execution of scripts in upload directories (e.g., using `.htaccess` or web server configurations).

## Threat: [Weak Password Hashing](./threats/weak_password_hashing.md)

- Description: Using outdated or weak password hashing algorithms makes user passwords vulnerable to cracking. Attackers can obtain password hashes from a database breach and use brute-force or dictionary attacks to recover the original passwords. **Yii2 provides secure hashing functions**, but developers might choose to use less secure alternatives.
- Impact: Account compromise, unauthorized access to user data.
- Affected Component: `yii\base\Security` (password hashing functions).
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Use strong and modern password hashing algorithms provided by Yii2 (e.g., `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`).**
  - Ensure proper salting of passwords.
  - Consider using a library like `defuse/php-encryption` for more robust cryptographic operations.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass](./threats/authorization_bypass.md)

- Description: Flaws in the implementation of **Yii2's RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system** or custom authorization logic can allow users to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized to. This could be due to incorrect role assignments, flawed permission checks, or vulnerabilities in custom authorization rules.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, privilege escalation.
- Affected Component: `yii\rbac\*` (RBAC components), controllers, access control filters.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - Carefully design and implement the RBAC system, defining clear roles, permissions, and assignments.
  - Thoroughly test authorization logic to ensure it functions as intended.
  - Use **Yii2's built-in access control features** (e.g., `AccessControl` filter).
  - Regularly review and update authorization rules.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Injection](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_template_injection.md)

- Description: While **Yii2's default template engines** escape output, vulnerabilities can arise if developers use raw output or if extensions introduce unsafe rendering practices. Attackers can inject malicious code into templates, which will then be executed in the user's browser when the template is rendered.
- Impact: Account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, information theft.
- Affected Component: Template rendering engine (e.g., PHP or Twig), custom view helpers or widgets.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Avoid using raw output in templates unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.**
  - Ensure that any custom view helpers or widgets properly escape output data.
  - Review the security practices of any third-party extensions used in the application.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_files.md)

- Description: Leaving configuration files (e.g., `config/db.php`) accessible in the webroot allows attackers to directly download and view sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other application secrets. This is a deployment issue that can expose **Yii2's configuration**.
- Impact: Information disclosure, potential full compromise of the application and related systems.
- Affected Component: Web server configuration, file system permissions.
- Risk Severity: Critical
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Ensure that the web server is configured to prevent direct access to configuration files.** This is usually done by placing the `web` directory as the document root and ensuring that files outside this directory are not directly accessible via HTTP.
  - Set appropriate file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files.

## Threat: [Use of Vulnerable Extensions](./threats/use_of_vulnerable_extensions.md)

- Description: Including third-party **Yii2 extensions** with known security vulnerabilities can introduce risks to the application. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
- Impact: Varies depending on the vulnerability in the extension, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
- Affected Component: Third-party Yii2 extensions.
- Risk Severity: Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be High or Critical).
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Regularly update all Yii2 extensions to their latest versions.**
  - Before using an extension, research its security history and reputation.
  - Consider using static analysis tools to scan for vulnerabilities in extensions.
  - If a vulnerable extension is necessary, consider patching it or finding a secure alternative.

## Threat: [Bypass of CSRF Protection](./threats/bypass_of_csrf_protection.md)

- Description: Improper implementation or misconfiguration of **Yii2's CSRF protection mechanisms** can allow attackers to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. This involves tricking authenticated users into making unintended requests on the application, potentially leading to data modification or unauthorized actions.
- Impact: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users, data manipulation.
- Affected Component: `yii\web\Request` (CSRF validation), forms using `Html::beginForm()`.
- Risk Severity: High
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Ensure that CSRF protection is enabled in the application configuration.**
  - Use `Html::beginForm()` to generate forms, which automatically includes the CSRF token.
  - Do not disable CSRF protection unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the risks.
  - For AJAX requests, send the CSRF token in a header or request parameter.

## Threat: [Weak Cryptographic Key Management](./threats/weak_cryptographic_key_management.md)

- Description: Insecure storage or handling of cryptographic keys used by **Yii2's security components** (e.g., for cookie validation, encryption) can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data. If keys are leaked or easily guessed, attackers can bypass security measures.
- Impact: Session hijacking, data decryption, bypassing security checks.
- Affected Component: `yii\base\Security`, application configuration.
- Risk Severity: Critical
- Mitigation Strategies:
  - **Store cryptographic keys securely, outside the webroot and with restricted access.**
  - Use strong, randomly generated keys.
  - Avoid hardcoding keys in the application code. Consider using environment variables or secure key management systems.
  - Rotate cryptographic keys periodically.
