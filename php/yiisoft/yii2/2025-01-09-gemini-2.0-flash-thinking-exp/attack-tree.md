## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Core Framework Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_core_framework_vulnerabilities.md)

* This represents a broad category of attacks targeting inherent weaknesses in the Yii2 framework itself. Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Default or Misconfigured Routes:**
    * **Discover Default Debug/Development Routes:** Attackers identify publicly accessible development routes (e.g., Gii, debug toolbar) often left enabled in production.
    * **Exploit Functionality Exposed by These Routes:** Attackers leverage the powerful features of these tools for malicious purposes, such as code generation, database manipulation, or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* This critical node focuses on how the application processes user-supplied data. Weaknesses here can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Submit Malicious Data in Form Submissions:** Attackers submit extra or unexpected data in form submissions.
    * **Lack of Proper Safe Attributes Definition in Models:** Due to missing or incorrect `safeAttributes` definitions in Yii2 models, the extra data gets assigned to model attributes, potentially modifying sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Security Component Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_security_component_weaknesses.md)

* This node highlights vulnerabilities in Yii2's built-in security features.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** CSRF Token Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__csrf_token_bypass.md)

* **Identify Weaknesses in CSRF Token Generation or Verification:** Attackers find flaws in how CSRF tokens are created or validated.
    * **Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Tokens:** If an XSS vulnerability exists, attackers can use JavaScript to steal legitimate CSRF tokens and bypass protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__authentication_bypass.md)

* **Exploit Flaws in Authentication Component Configuration:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in Yii2's authentication setup.
    * **Weaknesses in Custom Authentication Logic (If used):** If developers have implemented custom authentication, it might contain security flaws allowing bypass.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__authorization_bypass.md)

* **Exploit Flaws in RBAC Configuration:** Attackers find weaknesses in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules, granting them unauthorized access.
    * **Bypassing Access Checks in Controllers or Models:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the access control logic implemented in controllers or models.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities (Twig or PHP)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_templating_engine_vulnerabilities__twig_or_php_.md)

* This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how dynamic content is rendered in views.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code into Template Data:** Attackers inject code snippets into data that is then processed by the templating engine.
    * **Improper Sanitization of Data Passed to Templates:** The application fails to properly sanitize data before passing it to the template engine, allowing the injected code to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Yii2 Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_yii2_extensions.md)

* This highlights the risk introduced by third-party extensions.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Installed Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_installed_extensions.md)

* **Identify Vulnerable Extensions and Versions:** Attackers identify outdated or vulnerable Yii2 extensions used by the application.
    * **Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (e.g., through CVE databases):** Attackers leverage known exploits for these vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

* This node emphasizes the importance of secure configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Sensitive Information Exposure in Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__sensitive_information_exposure_in_configuration_files.md)

* **Access Configuration Files:** Attackers gain access to configuration files through misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
    * **Configuration Files Contain Database Credentials, API Keys, etc.:** Sensitive information is stored directly in configuration files, allowing attackers to retrieve it.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_default_configurations.md)

* **Yii2 Application is Running with Insecure Default Settings:** The application uses default settings that are not secure for production environments.
    * **Exploit Functionality Enabled by These Settings:** Attackers leverage the insecure default settings to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Misconfigured Security Components](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__misconfigured_security_components.md)

* **Improperly Configured CSRF Protection, Authentication, or Authorization:** Yii2's security features are not configured correctly, weakening their effectiveness.
    * **Exploit the Weaknesses Introduced by Misconfiguration:** Attackers exploit the gaps created by the misconfiguration.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Debug and Development Features Left Enabled](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_debug_and_development_features_left_enabled.md)

* This critical node highlights the danger of leaving development features active in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Access and Exploit the Debug Toolbar](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__access_and_exploit_the_debug_toolbar.md)

* **Debug Toolbar is Accessible in Production:** The debug toolbar, intended for development, is accessible to public users.
    * **Use Debug Toolbar to Gain Information or Execute Actions:** Attackers use the debug toolbar to view sensitive information, manipulate application state, or even execute code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Access and Exploit Gii (Code Generator)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__access_and_exploit_gii__code_generator_.md)

* **Gii is Accessible in Production:** The Gii code generation tool is accessible in the production environment.
    * **Use Gii to Generate Malicious Code or Overwrite Existing Files:** Attackers use Gii to inject malicious code into the application or overwrite critical files.
