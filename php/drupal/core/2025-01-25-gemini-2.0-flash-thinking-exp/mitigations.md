# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for drupal/core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prioritize and Apply Security Updates Immediately](./mitigation_strategies/prioritize_and_apply_security_updates_immediately.md)

### Description:

*   **Step 1:** Subscribe to Drupal Security Advisories. Go to Drupal.org and subscribe to the security newsletter or use an RSS feed to receive immediate notifications about security releases for Drupal core.
*   **Step 2:** Regularly monitor Drupal security advisories. Check your email or RSS feed frequently for new security advisories specifically for Drupal core.
*   **Step 3:** When a Drupal core security advisory is released, immediately assess its severity and relevance to your Drupal application. Drupal security advisories clearly indicate the severity level.
*   **Step 4:** Download the necessary patch or update for Drupal core. Drupal security advisories provide links to download patches or instructions for updating Drupal core.
*   **Step 5:** Apply the Drupal core patch or update in a development or staging environment first. Never apply security updates directly to production without testing.
*   **Step 6:** Thoroughly test the updated environment. Verify that the Drupal core update has been applied correctly and that no regressions or new issues have been introduced, focusing on core functionalities.
*   **Step 7:** Schedule and apply the Drupal core update to the production environment during a planned maintenance window.
*   **Step 8:** After applying the update to production, verify that the Drupal core update was successful and that the application is functioning as expected.
*   **Step 9:** Document the Drupal core update process and keep records of applied security patches for auditing and compliance purposes.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   Known Drupal Core Vulnerabilities (High Severity): This includes various types of vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and Access Bypass that are publicly disclosed in Drupal core and actively exploited.
*   Zero-day Exploits in Drupal Core (High Severity): While not directly mitigating zero-days before they are known, promptly applying security updates reduces the window of vulnerability if a zero-day exploit in Drupal core is discovered and a patch is quickly released.

### Impact:

*   Known Drupal Core Vulnerabilities: High Reduction. Applying security updates directly addresses and eliminates the known Drupal core vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation.
*   Zero-day Exploits in Drupal Core: Medium Reduction. Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered Drupal core vulnerabilities after a patch becomes available.

### Currently Implemented:

*   Partially Implemented.  A process for applying security updates likely exists, but the *speed* and *consistency* of application for Drupal core updates might vary.  Implemented within the DevOps and maintenance procedures.

### Missing Implementation:

*   Automated monitoring specifically for Drupal core security advisories and alerts.
*   Formal Service Level Agreement (SLA) for applying Drupal core security updates (e.g., Critical updates within 24-48 hours, High within a week).
*   Automated testing procedures specifically focused on verifying Drupal core security updates and preventing regressions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused Modules](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused_modules.md)

### Description:

*   **Step 1:** List all currently enabled Drupal core modules in your application. You can find this list in the Drupal admin interface under "Extend" or using Drush (`drush pml --type=module --status=enabled --core`).
*   **Step 2:** Review each enabled Drupal core module and determine if it is actively used by your application. Consider the functionality provided by each module and whether it is essential for the application's features.
*   **Step 3:** For Drupal core modules that are not actively used or whose functionality is no longer required, disable them. In the Drupal admin interface, go to "Extend," find the module, and uncheck the "Enabled" checkbox. Alternatively, use Drush (`drush dis <module_name>`).
*   **Step 4:** After disabling Drupal core modules, thoroughly test your application to ensure that disabling these modules has not broken any critical functionality. Test user workflows and key features that rely on core functionality.
*   **Step 5:** If disabling a Drupal core module causes issues, re-enable it and investigate alternative solutions, such as refactoring code to remove the dependency or finding a more secure alternative approach within Drupal core or other necessary modules.
*   **Step 6:** Regularly review the list of enabled Drupal core modules (e.g., during security audits or code reviews) and disable any newly identified unused Drupal core modules.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   Increased Attack Surface from Drupal Core Modules (Medium Severity): Unused Drupal core modules, even if not actively used, can contain vulnerabilities. Disabling them reduces the overall Drupal core codebase and potential entry points for attackers within core.
*   Vulnerability Exploitation in Unused Drupal Core Modules (Medium to High Severity): If an unused Drupal core module has a vulnerability, it can still be exploited if it is enabled, even if the application doesn't directly rely on its features.

### Impact:

*   Increased Attack Surface from Drupal Core Modules: Medium Reduction. Reduces the number of potential attack vectors within Drupal core by removing unnecessary core code.
*   Vulnerability Exploitation in Unused Drupal Core Modules: Medium to High Reduction. Eliminates the risk of vulnerabilities in disabled Drupal core modules being exploited.

### Currently Implemented:

*   Potentially Partially Implemented. Initial Drupal core module selection during project setup might have considered only necessary modules, but ongoing review and disabling of newly unused core modules might be missing.

### Missing Implementation:

*   Regular scheduled reviews of enabled Drupal core modules to identify and disable unused ones.
*   Automated tools or scripts to help identify potentially unused Drupal core modules based on usage patterns or code analysis.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict File Uploads and File Handling (Drupal Core Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_file_uploads_and_file_handling__drupal_core_configuration_.md)

### Description:

*   **Step 1:** Identify all file upload functionalities within your Drupal application that are handled by Drupal core's file upload mechanisms (e.g., content creation forms using core file fields, user profile uploads if using core profile features, media library if using core media module).
*   **Step 2:** For each Drupal core file upload field, configure allowed file extensions within Drupal's field settings. Restrict allowed file extensions to only those strictly necessary for the intended functionality (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `.doc`). Deny potentially dangerous extensions like `.php`, `.exe`, `.sh`, `.js`, `.html`, `.svg` within Drupal's configuration.
*   **Step 3:** Implement server-side file validation beyond extension checks, leveraging Drupal core's file API and PHP functions (like `mime_content_type`, `getimagesize`, fileinfo extensions) available within the Drupal environment to validate file content and type based on magic numbers and file headers, not just the file extension. This should be implemented within Drupal's form validation or custom modules interacting with Drupal core's file handling.
*   **Step 4:** Configure Drupal core to store uploaded files in a private directory outside of the webroot. In Drupal's file system settings (`admin/config/media/file-system`), set the "Public file system path" to a directory that is *not* directly accessible via the web server. Use Drupal's private file system for sensitive uploads, configured through Drupal's settings.
*   **Step 5:** Ensure that Drupal core's file serving mechanisms are used to control access to uploaded files. For private files, Drupal core's access control system will handle permissions. For public files (if absolutely necessary), ensure proper access control is in place within Drupal. Avoid direct links to files in the private directory, relying on Drupal's routing.
*   **Step 6:** Implement file size limits for uploads to prevent denial-of-service attacks and resource exhaustion, configuring maximum upload sizes in Drupal's file system settings and web server configurations (e.g., `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` in `php.ini` which affects Drupal's environment).
*   **Step 7:** Sanitize filenames during upload to prevent directory traversal and other filename-based attacks. Drupal core's file API provides functions for sanitizing filenames, ensure these are used when interacting with Drupal's file system.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   Malicious File Upload via Drupal Core Functionality (High Severity): Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, shell scripts, malware) disguised as legitimate file types through Drupal core's file upload features to gain control of the server or compromise the application.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via File Uploads through Drupal Core (Medium to High Severity): Uploaded files, especially SVG or HTML files, can contain embedded scripts that can be executed in a user's browser when the file is accessed or displayed through Drupal core's file handling.
*   Directory Traversal via Drupal Core File Handling (Medium Severity): Improper filename handling within Drupal core or custom modules interacting with core can allow attackers to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via File Uploads through Drupal Core (Medium Severity): Uploading excessively large files through Drupal core's upload mechanisms can consume server resources and lead to denial of service.

### Impact:

*   Malicious File Upload via Drupal Core Functionality: High Reduction. Restricting file types within Drupal, validating content using Drupal's API, and storing files outside the webroot as configured in Drupal significantly reduces the risk of executing malicious code.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via File Uploads through Drupal Core: Medium to High Reduction. Content validation using Drupal's API and proper handling of file display within Drupal can mitigate XSS risks.
*   Directory Traversal via Drupal Core File Handling: Medium Reduction. Filename sanitization using Drupal's API and secure file storage locations configured in Drupal reduce the risk of directory traversal attacks.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via File Uploads through Drupal Core: Medium Reduction. File size limits configured in Drupal and the server environment help prevent resource exhaustion from large uploads.

### Currently Implemented:

*   Partially Implemented. File extension restrictions are likely in place for some Drupal core file upload fields. Server-side validation using Drupal's API and private file system usage configured in Drupal might be inconsistently applied or missing in certain areas.

### Missing Implementation:

*   Comprehensive server-side file content validation for all Drupal core file upload fields using Drupal's API.
*   Consistent use of Drupal's private file system for sensitive uploads as configured in Drupal.
*   Automated checks to ensure Drupal core file upload configurations are secure and consistent across the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Error Reporting Appropriately (Drupal Core Setting)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_error_reporting_appropriately__drupal_core_setting_.md)

### Description:

*   **Step 1:** Access your Drupal `settings.php` file. This file is part of Drupal core and is typically located in `sites/default/settings.php` or `sites/<site_name>/settings.php`.
*   **Step 2:** Locate the `error_level` configuration setting in `settings.php`, which is a core Drupal setting.
*   **Step 3:** For production environments, set `error_level` to `ERROR_REPORTING_HIDE` or `ERROR_REPORTING_NONE`. This Drupal core setting will prevent detailed error messages from being displayed to users in the browser.
*   **Step 4:** For development and staging environments, set `error_level` to `ERROR_REPORTING_DISPLAY_SOME` or `ERROR_REPORTING_DISPLAY_ALL` to aid in debugging and development, leveraging Drupal core's error display capabilities.
*   **Step 5:** Ensure that errors are still being logged for debugging purposes, even in production. Drupal core's default logging mechanism or a dedicated logging module (like Monolog, if used within the Drupal context) should be configured to log errors to a secure location (e.g., database logs, syslog, log files outside the webroot), utilizing Drupal's logging facilities.
*   **Step 6:** Regularly review Drupal core's error logs to identify potential issues, including security-related errors or anomalies within the Drupal application.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   Information Disclosure via Drupal Core Error Messages (Medium Severity): Detailed error messages displayed by Drupal core to users can reveal sensitive information about the application's configuration, file paths, database structure, and code logic, which can be used by attackers to plan attacks against the Drupal application.

### Impact:

*   Information Disclosure via Drupal Core Error Messages: Medium Reduction. Hiding detailed error messages from Drupal core prevents attackers from gaining valuable information through error responses generated by Drupal core.

### Currently Implemented:

*   Likely Partially Implemented. Drupal core error reporting might be disabled in production, but the configuration might not be explicitly reviewed or enforced across all environments.

### Missing Implementation:

*   Explicit configuration management to ensure consistent Drupal core error reporting settings across development, staging, and production environments.
*   Regular review of Drupal core error logging configurations and practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden `settings.php` (Drupal Core Configuration File)](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden__settings_php___drupal_core_configuration_file_.md)

*   **Step 1:** Locate your Drupal `settings.php` file (typically in `sites/default/settings.php` or `sites/<site_name>/settings.php`), which is a core Drupal configuration file.
*   **Step 2:** **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure that `settings.php` has restrictive file permissions.  Ideally, it should be readable and writable only by the web server user and the user managing the server. Permissions like `640` or `600` are recommended. Use `chmod` command on Linux/Unix systems to adjust permissions of this Drupal core configuration file.
*   **Step 3:** **Externalize Database Credentials:** Instead of hardcoding database credentials directly in `settings.php`, consider using environment variables or an external configuration management system (like HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets). Drupal core supports reading database credentials from environment variables, configure Drupal to utilize this.
*   **Step 4:** **Secure `trusted_host_patterns`:** Carefully configure the `$settings['trusted_host_patterns']` array in `settings.php`. This Drupal core setting prevents host header injection attacks. Ensure that only your application's valid domain names and subdomains are included in this array, as per Drupal core's security recommendations.
*   **Step 5:** **Review and Harden Cookie Settings:** Examine cookie-related settings in `settings.php` (e.g., `$settings['cookie_domain']`, `$settings['cookie_httponly']`, `$settings['cookie_secure']`). Ensure they are configured appropriately for security (e.g., using `httponly` and `secure` flags where applicable), leveraging Drupal core's cookie handling mechanisms.
*   **Step 6:** **Disable Caching in `settings.php` for Development:** In development environments, disable caching in `settings.php` to facilitate development and debugging. However, ensure Drupal core's caching is properly enabled in production for performance and security.
*   **Step 7:** **Remove or Comment Out Unnecessary Code:** Remove or comment out any unnecessary or commented-out code in `settings.php` to reduce clutter and potential misconfigurations of this Drupal core file.
*   **Step 8:** **Regularly Review `settings.php`:** Include `settings.php` in regular security reviews and code audits to ensure it remains securely configured as a critical Drupal core configuration file.

### List of Threats Mitigated:

*   Unauthorized Access to Drupal Core Configuration (High Severity): If `settings.php` is not properly secured, attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive Drupal core configuration information, including database credentials.
*   Host Header Injection against Drupal Core (Medium Severity): Improperly configured `trusted_host_patterns` in Drupal core can allow attackers to manipulate the host header and potentially bypass Drupal core security checks or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   Session Hijacking within Drupal Application (Medium Severity): Insecure cookie settings in Drupal core can increase the risk of session hijacking attacks within the Drupal application.
*   Information Disclosure via Drupal Core Configuration (Medium Severity): Hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information in Drupal core's `settings.php` can be exposed if the file is compromised.

### Impact:

*   Unauthorized Access to Drupal Core Configuration: High Reduction. Restrictive file permissions and externalizing credentials significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Drupal core configuration.
