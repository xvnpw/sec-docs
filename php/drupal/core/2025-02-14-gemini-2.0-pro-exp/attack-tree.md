## Attack Tree Path: [[!] Gain Unauthorized Administrative Access](./attack_tree_paths/_!__gain_unauthorized_administrative_access.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker, providing complete control over the Drupal site and its data.
*   **Criticality:** This is the root node and the primary goal; all other nodes contribute to achieving this.

## Attack Tree Path: [***CVE-XXXX (Specific)***](./attack_tree_paths/cve-xxxx__specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of a publicly disclosed vulnerability (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in Drupal core. This could be any vulnerability with an assigned CVE identifier.
*   **High-Risk Rationale:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends on the specific CVE and the site's patching status. Zero-days are rare, but known vulnerabilities with available exploits are more common if the site isn't patched.
    *   **Impact:** High/Very High. The impact depends on the nature of the CVE. Remote Code Execution (RCE) or SQL Injection vulnerabilities can lead to complete site compromise.
    *   **Effort:** Low/Medium. Publicly available exploits often require minimal effort to use. Developing a new exploit (zero-day) would require high effort.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Using existing exploits requires some technical knowledge, but not necessarily expert-level skills.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can sometimes detect known exploits, but sophisticated attackers can often bypass them.
*   **Examples:**
    *   A SQL injection vulnerability in a core API.
    *   A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a core form.
    *   A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a core component.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Immediate Patching:** Apply security updates released by the Drupal Security Team as soon as they are available. This is the *most critical* mitigation.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help block exploit attempts, especially for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** An IDS/IPS can detect and potentially block malicious traffic associated with known exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [***[!]File System Misconfiguration***](./attack_tree_paths/_!_file_system_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect file system permissions that allow the web server (and thus, potentially, an attacker) to write to sensitive directories within the Drupal installation. The most common and dangerous example is making the `sites/default/files` directory writable by the web server.
*   **High-Risk Rationale:**
    *   **Likelihood:** High. This is a very common misconfiguration, especially on poorly managed servers or during manual installations.
    *   **Impact:** High. Allows attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code (e.g., web shells), leading to complete site compromise and data exfiltration.
    *   **Effort:** Very Low. Attackers can use automated tools to scan for and exploit misconfigured directories.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice. Requires very little technical skill.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy. Easily detected with security scanners and manual checks of file permissions.
*   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because it provides a direct path to code execution, bypassing many other security controls.
*   **Examples:**
    *   The `sites/default/files` directory being world-writable (777 permissions).
    *   The `sites/default/settings.php` file being writable by the web server.
    *   Any directory containing executable code (e.g., PHP files) being writable by the web server.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Correct File Permissions:** Follow Drupal's recommended file system permissions *precisely*.  Generally, directories should be 755 and files 644. The `sites/default/files` directory should *not* be writable by the web server in a production environment. Use a more secure method for file uploads (e.g., a separate, non-web-accessible directory).
    *   **Security Scanners:** Use security scanning tools (e.g., Drupal's Security Review module, external vulnerability scanners) to automatically detect misconfigured file permissions.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to manually verify file permissions.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** The web server user should only have write access to the absolute minimum number of directories necessary.
