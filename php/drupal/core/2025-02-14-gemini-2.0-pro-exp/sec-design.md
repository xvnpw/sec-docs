Okay, let's create a design document for the Drupal core project, keeping in mind its purpose and potential security considerations.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Drupal is a widely-used, open-source Content Management System (CMS).  It powers a significant portion of the web, ranging from personal blogs to large enterprise and government websites.  Therefore, the business posture centers around maintaining trust, ensuring stability, and fostering a vibrant community.

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a flexible and extensible platform for building websites and applications.
*   Maintain a high level of security and stability to protect user data and ensure website availability.
*   Foster a strong and active community of developers and contributors.
*   Ensure backwards compatibility and a smooth upgrade path for existing installations.
*   Provide comprehensive documentation and support resources.
*   Adapt to evolving web standards and technologies.

Business Risks:

*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or data breaches.
*   Loss of user trust and adoption due to instability or poor performance.
*   Decline in community participation, leading to slower development and fewer contributions.
*   Inability to keep up with evolving web standards, leading to obsolescence.
*   Legal and compliance issues related to data privacy and security.
*   Competition from other CMS platforms.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Drupal has a well-established security team and a history of addressing vulnerabilities promptly. However, given its widespread use and the complexity of web applications, ongoing vigilance is crucial.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: A dedicated security team that reviews code, responds to vulnerability reports, and releases security advisories. (Documented on Drupal.org security pages).
*   security control: Regular security releases and updates to address known vulnerabilities. (Documented on Drupal.org).
*   security control: A well-defined process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities. (Documented on Drupal.org).
*   security control: Coding standards and best practices that promote secure development. (Documented in Drupal's coding standards documentation).
*   security control: Input validation and output encoding to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks. (Implemented throughout the codebase).
*   security control: Access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality. (Implemented in the core user and permission system).
*   security control: Password hashing using strong, one-way algorithms (bcrypt). (Implemented in the user authentication system).
*   security control: Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks using tokens. (Implemented in the form API).
*   security control: Database abstraction layer to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. (Implemented in the database API).
*   security control: Support for HTTPS and other security-related HTTP headers. (Configurable in site settings).
*   security control: File system permissions management to restrict access to sensitive files. (Configurable in site settings and documented).
*   security control: A robust update system to ensure that sites can be easily updated to the latest secure version. (Implemented in the update manager).
*   security control: Session management that uses secure cookies and mitigates session hijacking risks. (Implemented in the session handling system).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The inherent risk of zero-day vulnerabilities in any complex software system.
*   accepted risk: The risk of misconfiguration by site administrators, leading to security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The risk of vulnerabilities in contributed modules or themes that are not maintained by the core Drupal security team.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries and dependencies, which may have their own vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks.
*   Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS connections.
*   Regularly audit and review contributed modules and themes for security vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a robust web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
*   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative users.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users must be authenticated before accessing restricted resources.
    *   Strong password policies must be enforced.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication should be considered.
    *   Session management must be secure and prevent session hijacking.

*   Authorization:
    *   A granular permission system must control access to different functionalities and content.
    *   The principle of least privilege should be applied.
    *   Access control decisions must be logged and auditable.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).
    *   Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.
    *   A whitelist approach to input validation should be preferred over a blacklist approach.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Sensitive data, such as passwords, must be stored using strong, one-way hashing algorithms.
    *   All communication between the client and server should be encrypted using HTTPS.
    *   Cryptographic keys must be managed securely.

## BUILD

Drupal core doesn't have a traditional "build" process in the same way as compiled languages. However, there's a process for packaging releases and managing dependencies.  This is largely handled by the Drupal community and infrastructure.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer(("Developer"))
    Git(("Git Repository (drupal.org)"))
    CI(("CI System (drupal.org)"))
    Packagist(("Packagist"))
    Composer(("Composer"))
    DrupalRelease(("Drupal Release"))

    Developer -- "Commits code" --> Git
    Git -- "Triggers build" --> CI
    CI -- "Runs tests" --> CI
    CI -- "Creates package" --> Packagist
    Composer -- "Downloads dependencies" --> Packagist
    Composer -- "Installs Drupal" --> DrupalRelease
```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   Code Review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.
*   Automated Testing: Drupal has an extensive suite of automated tests (unit, functional, integration) that are run on every code change.
*   Static Analysis: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential security vulnerabilities and coding standard violations.
*   Dependency Management: Composer is used to manage dependencies and ensure that only trusted and up-to-date packages are used.
*   Release Management: The Drupal security team manages the release process and ensures that security releases are created and distributed promptly.
*   Infrastructure Security: Drupal.org's infrastructure is secured to prevent unauthorized access and modification of the codebase.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Content delivery and presentation.
*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Content creation and management.
*   Website administration and configuration.
*   Extensibility via modules and themes.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, and potentially other personal data stored in user profiles or submitted through forms. (High Sensitivity)
*   Content Data: The content of the website, which may include sensitive or confidential information depending on the nature of the site. (Variable Sensitivity - from Low to High)
*   Configuration Data: Website configuration settings, which may contain sensitive information such as database credentials or API keys. (High Sensitivity)
*   Session Data: User session data, which can be used to hijack user sessions if compromised. (High Sensitivity)
*   Logs: System and application logs, which may contain sensitive information about user activity or system errors. (Medium Sensitivity)

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific third-party services are commonly integrated with Drupal installations? This will help in assessing the risks associated with those integrations.
*   What is the typical level of technical expertise of Drupal site administrators? This will influence the recommendations for security configuration and best practices.
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered for typical Drupal installations?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: We assume a mid-sized organization or project with a moderate risk appetite. They value security but also need to balance it with usability and functionality.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: We assume that the Drupal core is kept up-to-date with the latest security releases. We also assume that site administrators have a basic understanding of security best practices.
*   DESIGN: We assume a standard Drupal installation with common modules and themes. We also assume that the deployment environment is reasonably secure.
