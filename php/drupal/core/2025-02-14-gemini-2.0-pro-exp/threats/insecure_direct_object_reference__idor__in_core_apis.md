# Deep Analysis: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Drupal Core APIs

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities within Drupal core's API endpoints.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific core API endpoints that are potentially vulnerable to IDOR.
*   Understand the root causes of these potential vulnerabilities, focusing on how Drupal's access control mechanisms might be bypassed or misconfigured *within core itself*.
*   Propose concrete steps to enhance the security posture of these endpoints and prevent IDOR attacks.
*   Develop testing strategies to proactively identify and remediate IDOR vulnerabilities in core.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on **Drupal core's built-in API endpoints**.  This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **REST API (core module):**  Endpoints exposed by the `rest` module, including those for core entities like nodes, users, comments, taxonomy terms, etc.  We'll examine both the standard REST resources and any custom resource plugins defined *within core*.
*   **JSON:API (core module):** Endpoints provided by the `jsonapi` module, adhering to the JSON:API specification.  Again, we'll focus on core entities and any core-provided extensions.
*   **Other Core API Endpoints:**  Any other core functionality that exposes an API-like interface, even if not formally labeled as "REST" or "JSON:API". This might include endpoints used by core's internal AJAX system or form submissions that interact with core entities.
* **GraphQL (contrib):** Although GraphQL is contrib module, it is worth to mention, because it is very popular.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Contributed Modules:** Vulnerabilities in contributed modules are *not* part of this analysis.  We are solely concerned with the security of Drupal core.
*   **Custom Code:**  Vulnerabilities introduced by custom code (e.g., custom REST resource plugins, custom entity types) are also out of scope.
*   **Client-Side Vulnerabilities:**  We are focusing on server-side vulnerabilities related to access control.  Client-side issues (e.g., XSS) are not the primary focus.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will meticulously examine the source code of the `rest` and `jsonapi` modules, and other relevant core components.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying all API endpoint definitions (routes, controllers, resource plugins).
    *   Analyzing the access control checks performed within these endpoints (e.g., `_entity_access`, `$entity->access()`, permission checks).
    *   Tracing the flow of user-supplied input (especially object IDs) through the code.
    *   Looking for potential bypasses of access control logic (e.g., incorrect use of `AccessResult`, inconsistent checks).

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will perform dynamic testing using tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP.  This will involve:
    *   **Manual Testing:**  Crafting requests with manipulated object IDs (e.g., incrementing node IDs, changing user IDs) to attempt to access unauthorized data.
    *   **Automated Scanning:**  Using Burp Suite's Intruder or ZAP's active scanner to fuzz API endpoints with a range of object IDs.
    *   **Regression Testing:**  Developing automated tests to ensure that any identified vulnerabilities are fixed and do not reappear in future releases.

3.  **Documentation Review:**  We will review Drupal's official API documentation and security advisories to identify any known IDOR vulnerabilities or best practices related to API security.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the existing threat model as a starting point and refine it based on our findings during code review and dynamic analysis.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the IDOR Threat

### 2.1. Potential Vulnerability Areas in Core

Based on the scope and methodology, the following areas within Drupal core are considered high-risk for IDOR vulnerabilities:

*   **Entity Resource Endpoints (REST and JSON:API):**  The most obvious targets are the endpoints that allow access to core entities.  For example:
    *   `/node/{node}` (REST)
    *   `/jsonapi/node/article/{uuid}` (JSON:API)
    *   `/user/{user}` (REST)
    *   `/jsonapi/user/user/{uuid}` (JSON:API)
    *   Similar endpoints for comments, taxonomy terms, files, etc.

    The key vulnerability here is if the access control checks within these endpoints only verify that the *requested* entity exists, but *do not* verify that the *current user* has permission to view, edit, or delete that specific entity.

*   **Relationship Endpoints (JSON:API):**  JSON:API allows accessing and modifying relationships between entities.  For example:
    *   `/jsonapi/node/article/{uuid}/relationships/field_tags`

    IDOR vulnerabilities could arise if an attacker can manipulate the `{uuid}` to access or modify relationships on a node they shouldn't have access to.

*   **Batch Operations (REST and JSON:API):**  If core provides endpoints for performing batch operations (e.g., updating multiple nodes at once), these could be vulnerable if the access control checks are not applied consistently to *each* entity in the batch.

*   **Core AJAX Callbacks:**  Some core functionality uses AJAX callbacks that might interact with entities.  These callbacks need to be carefully scrutinized for IDOR vulnerabilities.

*   **Form API Submissions:**  While not strictly "APIs," form submissions that modify core entities can be vulnerable to IDOR if the form processing logic doesn't properly validate user permissions.  An attacker might be able to manipulate hidden form values (e.g., entity IDs) to bypass access control.

* **GraphQL:** Although it is contrib module, it is worth to mention. GraphQL allows to query multiple resources in one request. It is important to check access control for each resource.

### 2.2. Root Cause Analysis

The root causes of IDOR vulnerabilities in core APIs typically stem from one or more of the following:

*   **Insufficient Access Control Checks:**  The most common cause is simply not performing adequate access control checks.  This might involve:
    *   **Missing Checks:**  Failing to call `entity_access()` or `$entity->access()` at all.
    *   **Incorrect Operation:**  Using the wrong operation (e.g., checking 'view' access when 'update' access is required).
    *   **Incorrect Context:**  Not providing the correct context to the access check (e.g., not passing the current user).
    *   **Ignoring Access Results:**  Not properly handling the result of the access check (e.g., allowing access even if `AccessResult::isForbidden()` returns `TRUE`).

*   **Bypassing Access Control:**  Even if access control checks are present, there might be ways to bypass them.  This could involve:
    *   **Logic Errors:**  Flaws in the access control logic that allow unauthorized access under certain conditions.
    *   **Type Juggling:**  Exploiting PHP's type juggling behavior to manipulate access control checks (less likely in modern Drupal, but still worth considering).
    *   **Unintended Side Effects:**  Other core functionality that inadvertently grants access to entities (e.g., a view that exposes entity IDs without proper access control).

*   **Over-Reliance on Input Validation:**  While input validation is important, it should *not* be the sole defense against IDOR.  Access control checks are the primary mechanism.  Relying solely on input validation can lead to vulnerabilities if the validation logic is flawed or incomplete.

*   **Assumption of Authenticated User Permissions:**  Assuming that any authenticated user has permission to access certain entities is a dangerous assumption.  Drupal's permission system is granular, and access should always be explicitly checked.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The mitigation strategies outlined in the original threat model are a good starting point.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1.  **Robust Access Control (Implementation Details):**

    *   **Consistent Use of `entity_access()` and `$entity->access()`:**  These functions *must* be used consistently on *every* API endpoint that interacts with entities.  The correct operation ('view', 'update', 'delete', 'create') must be specified. The current user should *always* be passed as the second argument (or the relevant user object if checking access for a different user).
    *   **Proper Handling of `AccessResult`:**  The return value of `entity_access()` and `$entity->access()` is an `AccessResult` object.  Code *must* check this object correctly:
        *   `AccessResult::isAllowed()`:  Access is granted.
        *   `AccessResult::isForbidden()`:  Access is denied.
        *   `AccessResult::isNeutral()`:  Access is neither explicitly allowed nor denied (this usually means further checks are needed).
        *   `AccessResult::orIf()` and `AccessResult::andIf()`: Use these methods to combine multiple access checks correctly.
    *   **Permission-Based Access Control:**  For operations that don't map directly to entity access operations, use Drupal's permission system (`user_access()`).  Define specific permissions for API access and check them appropriately.
    *   **Access Control Handlers:**  For complex access control scenarios, consider using custom access control handlers (implementing `EntityAccessControlHandlerInterface`).  This allows you to centralize and encapsulate access control logic.
    * **Use of Views:** If API is built using Views, ensure that access control is properly configured in the View.

2.  **Input Validation (Beyond Basic Sanitization):**

    *   **Type Validation:**  Ensure that object IDs are of the expected type (e.g., integers for numeric IDs, UUIDs for UUIDs).
    *   **Range Validation:**  If object IDs have a known range, validate that they fall within that range.
    *   **Existence Validation:**  Verify that the requested object actually exists *before* performing any access control checks.  This prevents information leakage (e.g., an attacker could enumerate existing node IDs by trying different values).  However, be careful not to introduce timing attacks.
    * **Regular expression validation:** Use regular expressions to validate input format.

3.  **Don't Rely on Obscurity:**

    *   **Use UUIDs:**  Consider using Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) instead of sequential numeric IDs for entities.  UUIDs are much harder to guess, which makes brute-force IDOR attacks more difficult.  However, UUIDs alone are *not* a substitute for proper access control.
    *   **Avoid Predictable Patterns:**  Do not use any predictable patterns for generating object IDs or API endpoints.

4.  **Testing (Specific Techniques):**

    *   **Manual Parameter Manipulation:**  Use Burp Suite's Repeater or a similar tool to manually modify object IDs in API requests and observe the responses.  Look for:
        *   `200 OK` responses with data that should not be accessible.
        *   `403 Forbidden` responses that change to `200 OK` when manipulating IDs.
        *   Error messages that reveal information about the existence or structure of entities.
    *   **Automated Fuzzing:**  Use Burp Suite's Intruder or ZAP's active scanner to automatically generate a large number of requests with different object IDs.  Configure the tool to look for specific patterns in the responses that indicate IDOR vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) with security-focused rules to identify potential access control issues in the code.
    *   **Unit and Functional Tests:**  Write unit and functional tests that specifically target access control logic.  These tests should simulate different user roles and permissions and verify that access is granted or denied as expected.  Include tests that attempt to access entities with invalid or out-of-range IDs.
    * **Test all CRUD operations:** Create, Read, Update, Delete.

### 2.4. Example Scenario and Code Snippet (Illustrative)

**Scenario:**  A vulnerable REST endpoint for updating a node.

**Vulnerable Code (Illustrative - Simplified):**

```php
// In a REST resource plugin (e.g., MyNodeResource.php)

public function patch(EntityInterface $entity) {
  // Assume $entity is loaded based on a node ID from the URL.
  // ... (some code to update the node based on request data) ...

  $entity->save(); // Saves the node without checking update access!

  return new ResourceResponse($entity);
}
```

**Problem:**  The `patch()` method does *not* check if the current user has permission to update the node.  An attacker could send a `PATCH` request to `/node/{node_id}` with a modified `node_id` and update any node on the system.

**Mitigated Code:**

```php
// In a REST resource plugin (e.g., MyNodeResource.php)

public function patch(EntityInterface $entity) {
  // Check if the current user has permission to update the node.
  if (!$entity->access('update')) {
    throw new AccessDeniedHttpException('You do not have permission to update this node.');
  }

  // ... (some code to update the node based on request data) ...

  $entity->save();

  return new ResourceResponse($entity);
}
```

**Explanation of Mitigation:**  The `access('update')` check ensures that the current user has the necessary permission before allowing the node to be updated.  If the user does not have permission, an `AccessDeniedHttpException` is thrown, resulting in a `403 Forbidden` response.

### 2.5 GraphQL specific recommendations
* **Use Drupal's permission system:** Ensure that each field and type in your GraphQL schema has appropriate access control checks using Drupal's built-in permission system.
* **Validate arguments:** Validate all arguments passed to resolvers to ensure they are of the expected type and within acceptable ranges.
* **Use DataLoader:** DataLoader can help prevent the N+1 problem, which can lead to performance issues and potential denial-of-service attacks.
* **Limit query depth:** Limit the depth of queries that can be executed to prevent excessively complex queries that could impact server performance.
* **Rate limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the GraphQL API.

## 3. Conclusion

IDOR vulnerabilities in Drupal core APIs pose a significant security risk.  By combining thorough code review, dynamic testing, and a strong understanding of Drupal's access control mechanisms, we can effectively identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities.  The key is to ensure that *every* API endpoint that interacts with entities performs rigorous access control checks and that these checks cannot be bypassed.  Continuous testing and security audits are essential to maintain the security of Drupal core APIs over time.
