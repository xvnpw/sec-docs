# Deep Analysis: Drupal File System Misconfiguration Attack Path

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "File System Misconfiguration" attack path within a Drupal application, identify specific vulnerabilities related to `drupal/core`, assess the risks, and provide actionable recommendations for developers to prevent and mitigate this attack vector.  We aim to move beyond general advice and provide concrete, Drupal-specific guidance.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on file system misconfigurations within a Drupal installation using `drupal/core`.  It covers:

*   The `sites/default/files` directory and its subdirectories.
*   The `sites/default/settings.php` file.
*   Other potentially sensitive directories within the Drupal root and core.
*   The interaction between Drupal's file handling mechanisms and the underlying operating system's file permissions.
*   The impact of misconfigurations on Drupal's core functionality and security.
*   Common developer mistakes that lead to these misconfigurations.
*   Exploitation techniques used by attackers.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within contributed modules or themes (unless they directly relate to core file system interactions).
*   Server-level misconfigurations outside the scope of the Drupal application itself (e.g., web server configuration errors, though these can exacerbate the problem).
*   Database security issues (unless directly related to file system misconfigurations).

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Attack Tree Path Review:**  We start with the provided attack tree path description as a foundation.
2.  **Code Review:**  We will examine relevant sections of `drupal/core` code related to file handling, particularly in modules like `file`, `image`, and `system`.  This will help us understand how Drupal interacts with the file system and identify potential points of failure.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to Drupal file system misconfigurations, including CVEs and publicly disclosed issues.
4.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  We will review Drupal's official documentation and security best practices regarding file system permissions.
5.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:**  We will construct realistic exploitation scenarios to demonstrate the impact of different misconfigurations.
6.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  We will develop specific, actionable mitigation strategies for developers, including code examples, configuration recommendations, and testing procedures.
7.  **Tooling Recommendations:** We will suggest tools that can help automate the detection and prevention of file system misconfigurations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: [!] File System Misconfiguration

### 2.1.  Understanding the Threat

The core issue is that Drupal, like any web application, needs to interact with the file system.  It needs to:

*   Store uploaded files (images, documents, etc.).
*   Cache data for performance.
*   Read configuration files.
*   Potentially write to log files.

If the web server process (e.g., Apache, Nginx) has excessive write permissions, an attacker who gains *any* foothold on the system (even a seemingly minor vulnerability) can leverage those permissions to:

*   **Upload Malicious Files:**  The most common attack is uploading a PHP web shell.  This is a small PHP script that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Modify Existing Files:**  An attacker could modify `settings.php` to change database credentials, alter core Drupal files to inject malicious code, or deface the website.
*   **Create New Files:**  An attacker could create new PHP files in web-accessible directories, effectively adding new entry points to the application.

### 2.2.  Specific Drupal Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Scenarios

**2.2.1.  `sites/default/files` Misconfiguration (The Classic)**

*   **Vulnerability:** The `sites/default/files` directory (and its subdirectories) is writable by the web server user.  This is often a result of setting permissions to `777` (world-writable) during development or troubleshooting and forgetting to revert them.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** An attacker uses a tool like `wpscan` (even though it's primarily for WordPress, it can detect common misconfigurations) or a custom script to probe for writable directories.  They find that `https://example.com/sites/default/files/` is writable.
    2.  **Web Shell Upload:** The attacker crafts a simple PHP web shell (e.g., `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`) and saves it as `shell.php`.  They then use a tool like `curl` or a browser to upload this file to the vulnerable directory:
        ```bash
        curl -F "file=@shell.php" https://example.com/sites/default/files/
        ```
    3.  **Command Execution:** The attacker can now execute arbitrary commands on the server by accessing the web shell:
        ```
        https://example.com/sites/default/files/shell.php?cmd=ls -la /
        https://example.com/sites/default/files/shell.php?cmd=cat /etc/passwd
        ```
    4.  **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker uses the web shell to explore the system, potentially finding database credentials, SSH keys, or other sensitive information.  They might try to escalate privileges to gain root access.
    5.  **Data Exfiltration/Persistence:** The attacker exfiltrates sensitive data or establishes persistent access (e.g., by adding a backdoor user, modifying cron jobs).

*   **Drupal Core Interaction:** Drupal's file handling functions (e.g., `file_save_upload()`, `file_unmanaged_save()`) are used to manage files in this directory.  If the directory is writable, these functions will succeed in saving *any* file, including malicious ones.

**2.2.2.  `sites/default/settings.php` Misconfiguration**

*   **Vulnerability:** The `sites/default/settings.php` file is writable by the web server user.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** Similar to the previous scenario, the attacker identifies the writable file.
    2.  **Credential Modification:** The attacker modifies the `$databases` array in `settings.php` to point to a database server they control.  This allows them to intercept all database traffic and potentially steal or modify data.
    3.  **Code Injection:**  The attacker could add malicious PHP code to `settings.php`, which would be executed on every page load.

*   **Drupal Core Interaction:** Drupal reads `settings.php` on every request to obtain database connection details and other configuration settings.  If the file is modified, Drupal will use the attacker-supplied values.

**2.2.3.  Other Sensitive Directories**

*   **Vulnerability:** Other directories containing executable code (e.g., `core/`, `modules/`, `themes/`) are writable by the web server user.
*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies a writable directory within `core/` or a custom module.
    2.  **Code Modification:** The attacker modifies an existing PHP file to inject malicious code.  This could be a subtle change that's difficult to detect.
    3.  **Code Execution:** The injected code is executed when the modified file is loaded by Drupal.

*   **Drupal Core Interaction:** Drupal loads code from these directories as part of its normal operation.  Any modifications to these files will be executed.

### 2.3.  Mitigation Strategies (Developer-Focused)

**2.3.1.  Strict File Permissions (The Foundation)**

*   **Never use 777:** This is the cardinal rule.  `777` permissions grant read, write, and execute access to *everyone*.
*   **Follow Drupal's Recommendations:**
    *   Directories: Generally `755` (owner: read/write/execute, group: read/execute, others: read/execute).
    *   Files: Generally `644` (owner: read/write, group: read, others: read).
    *   `sites/default/files`:  This directory should *not* be directly writable by the web server in a production environment.
*   **Use a Separate User:**  The web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`) should *not* be the same user that owns the Drupal files.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they compromise the web server process.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The web server user should only have write access to the absolute minimum necessary directories.  Consider using a separate directory outside the web root for file uploads, and then using Drupal's file management functions to move them to the appropriate location.
* **.htaccess (Apache) or nginx.conf (Nginx) Configuration:** Use web server configuration files to *deny* access to sensitive files and directories, even if the file system permissions are incorrect.  For example, in Apache's `.htaccess`:

    ```apache
    <FilesMatch "\.(php|inc|module|install|engine|profile|po|sh|.*sql|theme|tpl(\.php)?|xtmpl|twig)(~|\.sw[op]|\.bak|\.orig|\.save)?$|^(\..*|Entries.*|Repository|Root|Tag|Template)$|^#.*#$|\.php(~|\.sw[op]|\.bak|\.orig\.save)?$">
      Order allow,deny
      Deny from all
    </FilesMatch>
    ```
    This prevents direct access to PHP files and other potentially sensitive files within the Drupal installation.  A similar configuration can be achieved with Nginx.

**2.3.2.  Secure File Upload Handling**

*   **Use Drupal's File API:**  Always use Drupal's built-in file handling functions (e.g., `file_save_upload()`, `file_managed_file_save_upload()`) to handle file uploads.  These functions perform security checks and ensure that files are stored in the correct location.
*   **Validate File Types:**  Use Drupal's file validation mechanisms to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.  For example, you can limit uploads to specific image types (e.g., JPG, PNG, GIF).
*   **Sanitize File Names:**  Drupal automatically sanitizes file names to prevent directory traversal attacks and other issues.  Do not bypass this sanitization.
*   **Consider a Separate Upload Directory:**  For enhanced security, consider using a separate directory *outside* the web root for initial file uploads.  Then, use Drupal's file management functions to move the files to the appropriate location within the `sites/default/files` directory (or a subdirectory) after validation. This prevents direct access to uploaded files before they have been validated.

**2.3.3.  Regular Security Audits and Scanning**

*   **Automated Scanners:**
    *   **Drupal's Security Review Module:**  This module checks for common security misconfigurations, including incorrect file permissions.
    *   **External Vulnerability Scanners:**  Tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Nikto can scan for web application vulnerabilities, including misconfigured directories.
    *   **Static Code Analysis Tools:** Tools like PHPStan, Psalm, and Phan can be integrated into the development workflow to detect potential security issues in the code.
*   **Manual Audits:**  Regularly review file permissions manually, especially after deployments or configuration changes.  Use the `find` command to identify files and directories with overly permissive permissions:

    ```bash
    find /path/to/drupal -type d -perm -o+w  # Find world-writable directories
    find /path/to/drupal -type f -perm -o+w  # Find world-writable files
    ```

**2.3.4.  Developer Training and Awareness**

*   **Security Best Practices Training:**  Ensure that all developers are familiar with Drupal's security best practices, including file system permissions.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Include security checks as part of the code review process.  Specifically look for any code that directly interacts with the file system.
*   **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL):**  Integrate security considerations into all stages of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment.

**2.3.5.  Containerization (Docker)**

*   **Immutable File Systems:**  When using Docker, you can create immutable file systems for your Drupal containers.  This means that the container's file system is read-only, preventing attackers from modifying files even if they gain access to the container.  Changes to the file system would require rebuilding the container image.
*   **Separate Volumes:**  Use Docker volumes to manage persistent data (e.g., uploaded files).  This separates the application code from the data, making it easier to manage and secure.
