## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities -> Target Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_-_target_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker monitors public sources like the Drupal security advisories, CVE databases, and security blogs for information about newly discovered vulnerabilities in Drupal core. Once a vulnerability is identified and understood, the attacker develops or obtains an exploit. This exploit is then used against a vulnerable Drupal application that has not been patched.
*   **Likelihood:** High - Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are actively targeted by attackers due to the availability of information and potential exploits.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution, data breaches, and complete system compromise.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available or can be developed with moderate effort.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Using existing exploits requires relatively low technical skill, while developing custom exploits requires more expertise.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - While intrusion detection systems (IDS) and web application firewalls (WAFs) can detect some exploitation attempts, sophisticated attackers may use techniques to evade detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 1: Abuse Features/Functionality -> Exploit Input Validation Flaws (Drupal Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1_abuse_featuresfunctionality_-_exploit_input_validation_flaws__drupal_specific_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Drupal core processes various forms of user input. Attackers identify weaknesses in how Drupal handles specific types of input, potentially related to form submissions, URL parameters, or API requests. By crafting malicious input that is not properly validated or sanitized by Drupal core, attackers can trigger unintended behavior. This could involve injecting malicious scripts (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS), manipulating database queries (though less common directly in core due to database abstraction), or even achieving remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in how Drupal processes certain data formats.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - Input validation flaws are a common vulnerability in web applications, and Drupal, despite its security focus, is not immune.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation can lead to various attacks, including XSS (allowing attackers to execute scripts in users' browsers), and potentially more severe issues like remote code execution.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Identifying specific input validation flaws in Drupal core requires some understanding of its architecture and code.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires a good understanding of web application security principles and how Drupal handles input.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detecting input validation attacks can be challenging as malicious input might resemble legitimate data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 2: Abuse Features/Functionality -> Abuse Access Control Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_2_abuse_featuresfunctionality_-_abuse_access_control_mechanisms.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Drupal has a robust permission system that controls access to various functionalities and data. Attackers attempt to bypass or abuse these access controls. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the permission checking logic, manipulating user roles or permissions through vulnerabilities, or leveraging misconfigurations in the access control setup. Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or administrative functionalities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - While Drupal's access control is generally well-designed, misconfigurations or subtle vulnerabilities can exist.
*   **Impact:** High - Gaining unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, modification of content, or complete control over the application.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding Drupal's permission system and potentially identifying subtle flaws in its implementation or configuration.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires knowledge of Drupal's user roles, permissions, and access control mechanisms.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detecting access control abuse can be challenging as it might involve actions that appear legitimate but are performed by an unauthorized user or with elevated privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Abuse Features/Functionality -> Leverage Drupal's Update System Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_abuse_featuresfunctionality_-_leverage_drupal's_update_system_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The Drupal update system is a critical component for maintaining security. Attackers target vulnerabilities within this system to inject malicious code or compromise the update process. This could involve exploiting flaws in how Drupal verifies update packages, manipulating the update process to install malicious modules or themes, or compromising the infrastructure used for distributing updates. Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain persistent control over the application, as their malicious code will be integrated into the core system.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - While Drupal's update system is designed with security in mind, vulnerabilities can be discovered.
*   **Impact:** High - Compromising the update system can lead to a complete and persistent compromise of the application.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires a deep understanding of Drupal's update mechanism and potentially sophisticated techniques to bypass security measures.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High - Requires significant technical expertise and knowledge of Drupal's internals.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Manipulating the update process can be difficult to detect, as it involves modifying core system files and processes.
