# Attack Surface Analysis for drupal/core

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in content rendering and user-generated content.](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_content_rendering_and_user-generated_content.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** Drupal core's content rendering pipeline and handling of user-generated content (e.g., comments, node bodies) can be vulnerable if input is not properly sanitized and output is not correctly escaped by core's mechanisms.
    *   **Example:** A user with permissions to post comments includes `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in their comment. When another user views the page, the script executes in their browser due to core's rendering process.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Utilize Drupal's built-in rendering mechanisms and Twig templating engine, which provide automatic contextual escaping.
            *   Employ proper input sanitization using Drupal's APIs (e.g., `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Xss::filterAdmin()`, `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Html::escape()`).
            *   Avoid directly concatenating user input into HTML without escaping.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Potential for SQL Injection vulnerabilities through improper use of database APIs.](./attack_surfaces/potential_for_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_through_improper_use_of_database_apis.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database queries.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** While Drupal core's database abstraction layer provides significant protection against SQL injection, vulnerabilities can arise if developers bypass this layer or use it incorrectly *within core modules* or when core APIs are misused leading to insecure query construction.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability within a core module directly constructs a SQL query using user-supplied data without proper parameterization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution in some database configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Always** use Drupal's database abstraction layer (Database API) for database interactions.
            *   Utilize parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
            *   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user input.
            *   Regularly review core code and any custom code extending core for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass vulnerabilities.](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative functions without proper credentials.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in Drupal core's authentication mechanisms, such as flaws in password hashing, session management, or login procedures, can directly lead to authentication bypass.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the core password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information and functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Adhere to secure coding practices when implementing authentication-related features within core.
            *   Utilize Drupal's built-in authentication and authorization systems correctly.
            *   Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication where possible.
            *   Regularly review and update Drupal core to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Access Control vulnerabilities leading to privilege escalation.](./attack_surfaces/access_control_vulnerabilities_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain higher privileges than they are intended to have.
    *   **How Core Contributes:**  Flaws in Drupal's core permission system or how core modules enforce access controls can allow users to bypass restrictions and perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a core module allows a user with limited permissions to access or modify content that should only be accessible to administrators due to a flaw in core's access checking logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential for complete site compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Thoroughly understand and correctly implement Drupal's core permission system.
            *   Enforce access controls at multiple levels (e.g., route access, entity access) within core modules.
            *   Avoid relying solely on UI-based permission settings; implement programmatic access checks where necessary within core.
            *   Regularly audit and review access control logic in core modules.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Update System.](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_update_system.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the process of updating Drupal core.
    *   **How Core Contributes:**  Vulnerabilities in the core update mechanism itself, such as insecure download protocols or insufficient verification of update packages, can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the core update process and injects a malicious version of Drupal core.
    *   **Impact:**  Installation of malware, backdoors, or compromised code, leading to complete site compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (Drupal Core):**
            *   Implement secure update mechanisms, including using HTTPS for downloads and verifying package integrity using cryptographic signatures.
        *   **Users (Administrators):**
            *   Keep Drupal core up-to-date with the latest security releases.
            *   Download updates only from trusted sources (e.g., drupal.org).
            *   Verify the integrity of downloaded update packages before installation.
            *   Consider using tools like Drush or Composer for managing updates, which often provide more secure update processes.
