# Threat Model Analysis for drupal/core

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Node Title](./threats/sql_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_node_title.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious node title containing SQL code. When Drupal core processes and uses this title in a database query without proper sanitization, the attacker's SQL code is executed.

**Impact:**  The attacker could read, modify, or delete arbitrary data in the Drupal database, potentially gaining full control of the application and its data.

**Affected Component:**  `Node module` (within Drupal core), specifically functions involved in saving and querying node entities (e.g., `Node::save()`, database query builders).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use Drupal's database abstraction layer (DBAL) and prepared statements with placeholders for user-provided data in database queries.
*   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user input.
*   Utilize Drupal's form API and validation mechanisms to sanitize input before it reaches the database layer.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unfiltered User Profile Field](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unfiltered_user_profile_field.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a user profile field (e.g., "About me") if Drupal core doesn't properly filter the input. When another user views this profile, the attacker's script executes in their browser.

**Impact:** The attacker could steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Affected Component:** `User module` (within Drupal core), specifically functions related to user profile rendering and saving (e.g., `user_view()`, form submission handlers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all user-provided content is properly filtered for XSS vulnerabilities during rendering.
*   Utilize Drupal's rendering pipeline and Twig templating engine with auto-escaping enabled.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Improperly Sanitized File Paths](./threats/command_injection_via_improperly_sanitized_file_paths.md)

**Description:** If Drupal core uses user-provided input to construct file paths for operations like image processing or file manipulation without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject shell commands into the path.

**Impact:** The attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user, potentially leading to full server compromise.

**Affected Component:**  Potentially various core modules dealing with file handling, such as `Image module`, `File module`, or core functions used by these modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using user input directly in system commands.
*   If necessary, use whitelisting and strict validation to ensure file paths are safe.
*   Utilize secure file handling libraries and functions provided by the operating system or programming language.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Missing Output Encoding in Block Title](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_missing_output_encoding_in_block_title.md)

**Description:** If Drupal core fails to properly encode the title of a block before rendering it in HTML, an attacker could create a block with a malicious title containing JavaScript code.

**Impact:** Similar to the previous XSS threat, the attacker could steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the website.

**Affected Component:** `Block module` (within Drupal core), specifically the rendering pipeline for block titles and potentially the theme system within core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all output is encoded appropriately for the context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) during rendering.
*   Leverage Twig's auto-escaping feature and explicitly escape variables when necessary.
*   Regularly review theme templates and custom code for potential output encoding vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Access Bypass via Vulnerability in Node Access System](./threats/access_bypass_via_vulnerability_in_node_access_system.md)

**Description:** A flaw in Drupal core's node access system could allow an attacker to view or edit nodes they are not authorized to access, bypassing the intended permissions.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive content, potential data breaches, and the ability to modify or delete content.

**Affected Component:** `Node module` (within Drupal core), specifically the node access API and related functions (e.g., `node_access()`, `hook_node_access_records()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test custom access control logic.
*   Keep Drupal core updated to benefit from security patches addressing access control vulnerabilities.
*   Follow Drupal's best practices for implementing custom access rules.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Flaw in Role Assignment](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_flaw_in_role_assignment.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in how Drupal core manages user roles could allow an attacker to grant themselves higher privileges than intended, potentially gaining administrative access.

**Impact:** Full control over the Drupal application, including the ability to manage users, content, and configuration.

**Affected Component:** `User module` (within Drupal core), specifically functions related to role assignment and permission management (e.g., `user_role_grant_permissions()`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit user roles and permissions.
*   Apply security updates promptly to address known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
*   Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Vulnerability in a Core API Endpoint](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_vulnerability_in_a_core_api_endpoint.md)

**Description:** A security flaw in a Drupal core API endpoint could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted request that leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Drupal application and potentially the underlying server.

**Affected Component:**  Specific API endpoints within Drupal core modules (e.g., RESTful Web Services module, JSON:API module - if part of core).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received by API endpoints.
*   Implement proper authentication and authorization for API access.
*   Keep Drupal core and contributed modules updated to patch API vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Core Update](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_during_core_update.md)

**Description:** If the communication channel used by Drupal core to download updates is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS without proper certificate validation), an attacker could intercept the update process and inject malicious code.

**Impact:** Installation of compromised Drupal core files, leading to full site compromise.

**Affected Component:**  The Drupal core update manager.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Drupal core is configured to use secure protocols (HTTPS) for downloading updates.
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded updates using checksums or signatures.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/unrestricted_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** If Drupal core doesn't properly validate the type and content of uploaded files, an attacker could upload a malicious executable file (e.g., a PHP web shell) and then access it directly to execute code on the server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Drupal application and potentially the underlying server.

**Affected Component:** `File module` (within Drupal core) and core functions handling file uploads.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just the file extension.
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in locations with restricted execution permissions.
*   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
