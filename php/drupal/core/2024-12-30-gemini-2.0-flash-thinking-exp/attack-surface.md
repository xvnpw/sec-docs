*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Description:**  Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal session cookies, redirect users, or deface websites.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** Drupal core handles user-provided content and renders it in the browser. If output encoding is not properly applied, malicious scripts can be executed. The Form API and rendering pipeline are key areas.
    *   **Example:** A user submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If this comment is displayed without proper escaping by Drupal's rendering engine, the script will execute in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement proper output encoding/escaping:** Use Drupal's built-in functions like `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Html::escape()` or Twig's `escape` filter for all user-generated content displayed on the site.
        *   **Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of injected scripts.
        *   **Sanitize user input:** While output encoding is the primary defense, sanitizing input can provide an additional layer of protection against certain types of XSS.
        *   **Keep Drupal core updated:** Security updates often include fixes for XSS vulnerabilities within the core.

*   **Attack Surface: SQL Injection**
    *   **Description:**  Allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database queries. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or even complete database takeover.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** Drupal core uses a database abstraction layer, but improper use of database APIs or direct SQL queries *within core* can introduce vulnerabilities. Dynamic query building without proper sanitization in core modules is a key risk.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a core module's database query construction allows an attacker to inject `'; DROP TABLE users; --` through a crafted URL parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data loss, unauthorized data modification, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Drupal's database API correctly:** Utilize prepared statements and parameterized queries provided by Drupal's database abstraction layer. *Core development adheres to this, but vigilance is needed.*
        *   **Avoid direct SQL queries:** Minimize the use of `db_query()` and favor the Entity API or Query Builder *within core development*.
        *   **Sanitize user input intended for database queries:** While the database API should handle this, ensure any custom query logic *within core* properly escapes or validates input.
        *   **Keep Drupal core updated:** Security updates often address SQL injection vulnerabilities within the core.

*   **Attack Surface: Access Control Bypass**
    *   **Description:**  Allows unauthorized users to access resources or perform actions they should not be able to. This can lead to privilege escalation and data breaches.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** Drupal's permission system and access checking mechanisms are fundamental. Vulnerabilities can arise from flaws in how permissions are defined, checked, or enforced *within core*.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a core routing mechanism allows an attacker to craft a URL that bypasses core permission checks and grants access to an administrative page.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, ability to modify site configuration or content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Follow Drupal's access control best practices:** Properly define and implement permissions for roles and users *within core development*.
        *   **Thoroughly test access control logic:** Ensure that permissions are enforced as intended *within core*.
        *   **Be cautious with custom access checks:** Ensure custom access logic *within core* is secure and doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   **Keep Drupal core updated:** Security updates often address access control vulnerabilities within the core.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure File Uploads**
    *   **Description:**  Allows attackers to upload malicious files to the server. These files can be used for various attacks, including remote code execution, website defacement, or serving as malware distribution points.
    *   **How Core Contributes:** Drupal core provides file upload functionality. Improper validation of file types, sizes, and content *within core's file handling mechanisms* can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in core's file upload processing allows an attacker to bypass file type restrictions and upload a PHP script.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, malware distribution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate file types:** Restrict allowed file extensions to only necessary and safe types *within core's file upload handling*.
        *   **Sanitize file names:** Prevent malicious file names that could lead to path traversal or other issues *within core's file handling*.
        *   **Store uploaded files outside the webroot:** This prevents direct execution of uploaded scripts. *This is a general best practice, but core's default behavior should adhere to this.*
        *   **Implement file scanning:** Use antivirus or malware scanning tools to check uploaded files for malicious content. *This is an additional layer, but core should provide a secure foundation.*
        *   **Set appropriate file permissions:** Ensure uploaded files have restrictive permissions. *Core's file handling should enforce secure defaults.*
