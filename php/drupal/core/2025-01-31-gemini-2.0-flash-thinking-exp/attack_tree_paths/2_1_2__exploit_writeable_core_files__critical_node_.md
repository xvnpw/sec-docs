### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.2. Exploit Writeable Core Files [CRITICAL NODE]

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown

**Attack Vector:** Leveraging writeable permissions on core files to inject malicious code or modify configurations.

This attack vector hinges on a fundamental security misconfiguration: **incorrect file system permissions**. In a properly secured Drupal installation, core files should be read-only for the web server user. If core files become writeable by the web server user (or a user the web server process runs as), it opens a critical vulnerability.

**Why are core files typically read-only?**

* **Integrity:** Read-only permissions ensure the integrity of the core application code.  Unauthorized modifications are prevented, protecting against accidental or malicious changes.
* **Security:**  Preventing write access to core files significantly reduces the attack surface. Attackers cannot directly modify the application's logic or inject malicious code if they lack write permissions.

#### 4.2. Prerequisites for Exploitation

For this attack to be successful, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. **Writeable Core Files:**  The most crucial prerequisite is that one or more files within the Drupal core directory structure must be writeable by the web server user (or the user under which the web server process runs, e.g., `www-data`, `apache`, `nginx`). This is a **misconfiguration** and should not be the default state in a secure Drupal installation.

2. **Web Server User Access:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger actions that are executed by the web server user. This is typically achieved through web requests to the Drupal application.

3. **Knowledge of Drupal Core Structure (Optional but Helpful):** While not strictly necessary, understanding Drupal's file structure and bootstrapping process can significantly aid an attacker in identifying critical files to target and crafting effective payloads.

#### 4.3. Attack Steps

An attacker exploiting writeable core files would typically follow these steps:

1. **Identify Writeable Core Files:** The attacker first needs to determine if any core files are writeable. This can be done through various methods:
    * **Error Messages:** Misconfigured servers might inadvertently reveal file permissions in error messages.
    * **Directory Listing (if enabled):** If directory listing is enabled (which is a security vulnerability in itself), an attacker could browse the Drupal core directories and potentially identify writeable files.
    * **Brute-force File Upload/Modification Attempts:**  An attacker could attempt to upload or modify known core files and observe the server's response.
    * **Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities:**  Other vulnerabilities in the application or server might inadvertently leak file permission information.

2. **Choose Target File(s):** Once writeable files are identified, the attacker will choose target files to modify.  Effective targets are typically:
    * **`index.php` (or similar entry point):** Modifying the main entry point allows the attacker to execute code at the very beginning of the Drupal request lifecycle, potentially hijacking the entire application.
    * **Configuration Files (`settings.php`, etc.):** Modifying configuration files can allow the attacker to change database credentials, disable security features, or redirect traffic.
    * **Frequently Executed Core Modules/Includes:** Injecting code into commonly used modules or include files ensures that the malicious code is executed frequently and potentially on every page load.

3. **Inject Malicious Code or Modify Configuration:** The attacker injects malicious code into the chosen writeable file(s). Common types of malicious code include:
    * **PHP Backdoors:**  Code that allows the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    * **Web Shells:**  Interactive interfaces that provide command-line access to the server through the web browser.
    * **Malicious Redirects:** Code that redirects users to attacker-controlled websites for phishing or malware distribution.
    * **Data Exfiltration Scripts:** Code that steals sensitive data from the Drupal database or file system.
    * **Configuration Changes:** Modifying configuration files to disable security features, create administrator accounts, or alter application behavior.

4. **Trigger Execution:** The attacker then triggers the execution of the injected code. This is usually done by simply accessing the Drupal website through a web browser, as Drupal's bootstrapping process will execute the modified core files.

#### 4.4. Technical Details and Impact

* **Code Execution Context:**  Injected code is executed with the privileges of the web server user. This user often has significant access to the server's file system and potentially database access.
* **Persistence:** Malicious code injected into core files can be persistent, meaning it remains active even after server restarts or application updates (unless the core files are overwritten by a clean installation or update process).
* **Impact - High - Critical:** The impact of successfully exploiting writeable core files is classified as "High - Critical" because:
    * **Full Application Compromise:**  Attackers gain complete control over the Drupal application. They can modify any aspect of the site, including content, functionality, and user data.
    * **Server Compromise:**  Depending on the web server user's permissions and server configuration, attackers can potentially escalate their privileges and compromise the entire server.
    * **Data Breach:**  Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the Drupal database, including user credentials, personal information, and confidential business data.
    * **Website Defacement and Reputation Damage:** Attackers can deface the website, causing reputational damage and loss of user trust.
    * **Malware Distribution:**  Compromised Drupal sites can be used to distribute malware to website visitors.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

Preventing writeable core files and mitigating the risk of this attack vector requires a multi-layered approach:

1. **Correct File Permissions:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the web server user has the **minimum necessary permissions**. Core files and directories should be **read-only** for the web server user.
    * **Proper Installation and Configuration:**  During Drupal installation and configuration, ensure that file permissions are set correctly. Drupal documentation provides guidance on recommended file permissions.
    * **Regular Audits:**  Periodically audit file permissions on the Drupal installation to ensure they remain correctly configured. Tools and scripts can be used to automate this process.

2. **Security Hardening:**
    * **Disable Directory Listing:**  Ensure directory listing is disabled on the web server to prevent attackers from easily browsing file structures.
    * **Restrict Web Server User Permissions:**  Limit the permissions of the web server user to the absolute minimum required for Drupal to function.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious requests, including attempts to exploit file upload vulnerabilities or inject code.

3. **Regular Security Updates:**
    * **Keep Drupal Core and Modules Up-to-Date:**  Regularly apply security updates released by the Drupal security team. These updates often patch vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to file permission issues or code injection.
    * **Security Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement security monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activity and potential security breaches.

4. **Secure Server Configuration:**
    * **Operating System Security:**  Harden the underlying operating system and ensure it is up-to-date with security patches.
    * **Web Server Security:**  Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) securely, following best practices and security guidelines.
    * **Firewall:**  Implement a firewall to restrict network access to the server and Drupal application.

5. **Code Review and Security Audits:**
    * **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews of custom modules and themes to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Perform periodic penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the Drupal installation.

#### 4.6. Real-World Examples and Drupal Context

While direct CVEs specifically targeting "writeable core files" as the *initial* vulnerability are less common (as it's often a misconfiguration), the *impact* of writeable files is frequently seen in exploits stemming from other vulnerabilities.

* **Exploits after Initial Compromise:**  Attackers who gain initial access through other vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, remote code execution in a contributed module) often leverage writeable file permissions (if they exist due to misconfiguration) to establish persistence by injecting backdoors into core files.
* **Misconfigured Hosting Environments:**  Shared hosting environments or poorly configured VPS/dedicated servers can sometimes have default file permissions that are too permissive, making core files writeable.
* **Accidental Permission Changes:**  Administrators might inadvertently change file permissions during maintenance or troubleshooting, unintentionally making core files writeable.

**Drupal Specific Considerations:**

* **`sites/default/settings.php`:** This file is a critical configuration file. While it needs to be writeable *during installation*, it should be made read-only afterwards.  If `settings.php` remains writeable, attackers can modify database credentials and other critical settings.
* **`modules/`, `themes/`, `libraries/` directories:** While not strictly "core" in the strictest sense, these directories within the Drupal installation are also sensitive and should generally not be writeable by the web server user for security reasons, except for specific scenarios like module/theme installation through the web UI (which should be carefully controlled).

#### 4.7. Severity and Likelihood Assessment

* **Severity: High - Critical:** As established, the impact of exploiting writeable core files is extremely severe, potentially leading to complete application and server compromise.
* **Likelihood:** The likelihood of this attack path being exploitable depends heavily on the security posture of the Drupal installation.
    * **Low Likelihood (Securely Configured Drupal):** In a properly configured Drupal environment with correct file permissions, the likelihood of core files being writeable is very low.
    * **Medium to High Likelihood (Misconfigured Drupal):** In environments with misconfigured file permissions, especially in shared hosting or less security-conscious setups, the likelihood can be significantly higher.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit Writeable Core Files" attack path, while often stemming from a misconfiguration rather than a direct Drupal core vulnerability, represents a **critical security risk**.  Proper file permission management is a fundamental security practice for Drupal and all web applications.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, development teams and system administrators can significantly reduce the risk of this highly impactful attack vector. Regular security audits and adherence to Drupal security best practices are essential to maintain a secure Drupal environment.
