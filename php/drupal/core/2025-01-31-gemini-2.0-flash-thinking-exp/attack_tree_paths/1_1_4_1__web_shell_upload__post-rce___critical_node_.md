### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.4.1. Web Shell Upload (Post-RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]

**Attack Vector:** After achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE), attackers often upload a web shell (a script that allows command execution through a web interface) to maintain persistent access even if the initial vulnerability is patched.

**Impact:** Critical. Web shells provide a backdoor for persistent access and control, enabling a wide range of malicious activities.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Prerequisites:**
    * **Successful Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the fundamental prerequisite. The attacker must have already exploited a vulnerability in the Drupal application or its environment to execute arbitrary code on the server. Common RCE vulnerabilities in web applications, and potentially Drupal, can include:
        * **Unsafe Deserialization:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Drupal handles serialized data (e.g., Drupalgeddon 2 - CVE-2017-6385).
        * **SQL Injection leading to Code Execution:**  In certain scenarios, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be leveraged to execute system commands or write files to the server.
        * **Template Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in template engines (like Twig in Drupal) to inject and execute code.
        * **File Upload Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting flaws in file upload mechanisms (in core or contributed modules) that allow uploading and executing arbitrary files, including PHP scripts.
        * **Code Injection Vulnerabilities:** Direct injection of malicious code into application logic due to insufficient input validation.

* **Steps Involved in Web Shell Upload:**

    1. **Vulnerability Exploitation and RCE Acquisition:** The attacker first identifies and exploits a vulnerability in the Drupal application to gain Remote Code Execution. This step is outside the scope of this specific attack path but is crucial for its initiation.
    2. **Web Shell Selection and Preparation:** The attacker chooses or crafts a web shell script. Common web shell languages for web servers are PHP, Python, Perl, or ASP. For Drupal (primarily PHP-based), PHP web shells are most prevalent. These scripts typically include functionalities for:
        * **Command Execution:** Executing system commands on the server.
        * **File System Browsing and Manipulation:**  Viewing, uploading, downloading, and modifying files and directories.
        * **Database Interaction:**  Connecting to and querying databases (if credentials are accessible).
        * **Privilege Escalation:** Attempting to gain higher privileges on the system.
        * **Network Scanning:**  Scanning the internal network for further targets.
    3. **Identifying Writable Upload Location:** The attacker needs to find a location on the Drupal server where they have write permissions and which is accessible via web requests. Common potential locations include:
        * **`sites/default/files/` directory:**  Drupal's default public files directory. If permissions are misconfigured or if Drupal's file handling logic is bypassed, this could be writable.
        * **Temporary directories (`/tmp`, `sites/default/files/tmp`):**  Depending on server configuration and Drupal's temporary file handling, these might be accessible and writable.
        * **Publicly accessible directories of contributed modules or themes:** If modules or themes have insecure file upload functionalities or misconfigured permissions, their public directories could be exploited.
        * **Cache directories:** In some cases, cache directories might be writable and accessible via web requests.
    4. **Web Shell Upload via RCE:** Using the already established RCE, the attacker uploads the prepared web shell script to the identified writable location. Common methods for uploading via RCE include:
        * **Using command-line tools:**  Tools like `wget` or `curl` (if available on the server) can be used to download the web shell from an external attacker-controlled server or upload it directly using `POST` requests.
        * **Direct file writing using RCE:**  If the RCE allows arbitrary code execution (e.g., PHP code execution), the attacker can use functions like `file_put_contents()` in PHP to write the web shell script directly to the target location.
        * **Exploiting file upload functionalities (if still accessible after initial RCE):**  Even if the initial RCE vulnerability is patched, other file upload functionalities might still be vulnerable and usable for web shell upload.
    5. **Web Shell Access and Verification:** After successful upload, the attacker accesses the web shell through a web browser by navigating to the uploaded script's URL (e.g., `http://drupal-site.com/sites/default/files/webshell.php`). They then verify that the web shell is functional by executing commands or performing other actions.

* **Technical Details in Drupal Context:**

    * **Drupal's File System Structure:** Understanding Drupal's directory structure is crucial for attackers to identify potential upload locations. `sites/default/files/` is a common target due to its intended public accessibility for user-uploaded files.
    * **Permissions and File Handling:** Drupal's security relies on proper file permissions and secure file handling practices. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in these areas can lead to writable web-accessible directories.
    * **PHP as the Primary Language:** Drupal's core and most modules are written in PHP, making PHP web shells highly effective for exploitation.
    * **Database Credentials:** If the web shell is uploaded successfully, attackers can often access Drupal's `settings.php` file (or environment variables) to retrieve database credentials, allowing them to directly interact with the Drupal database.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**

    * **Prevent Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most effective mitigation is to prevent RCE vulnerabilities in the first place. This involves:
        * **Regularly patching Drupal core and contributed modules:** Keeping Drupal up-to-date is critical to address known vulnerabilities.
        * **Secure coding practices:** Following secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and code injection.
        * **Input validation and output encoding:** Properly validating user inputs and encoding outputs to prevent injection attacks.
        * **Security audits and penetration testing:** Regularly conducting security assessments to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implementing a WAF to detect and block malicious requests targeting known vulnerabilities.
    * **Restrict File Uploads and Permissions:**
        * **Properly configure Drupal's file system permissions:** Ensure that web-accessible directories are not writable by the web server process unless absolutely necessary.
        * **Restrict allowed file types for uploads:**  Limit file uploads to only necessary file types and block execution-prone file types like `.php`, `.jsp`, `.py`, etc., unless explicitly required and securely handled.
        * **Sanitize filenames:**  Sanitize uploaded filenames to prevent directory traversal or other malicious manipulations.
        * **Store uploaded files outside the webroot:** If possible, store user-uploaded files outside the web server's document root to prevent direct execution of uploaded scripts.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM to monitor critical Drupal directories for unauthorized file modifications or additions, including the creation of new PHP files in unexpected locations.
    * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS solutions to detect and block suspicious network traffic and web requests associated with web shell activity.
    * **Log Monitoring and Analysis:**  Implement robust logging and monitoring of web server access logs, application logs, and security logs. Analyze logs for suspicious patterns, such as unusual POST requests, access to unknown PHP files, or error messages indicating exploitation attempts.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege to the web server user and Drupal processes, limiting their access to only necessary resources.

* **Detection Methods:**

    * **Web Server Log Analysis:** Monitor web server access logs for:
        * **Unusual POST requests:** Web shell uploads often involve POST requests to upload files.
        * **Access to unknown PHP files:** Look for requests to PHP files that are not part of the standard Drupal installation or expected modules/themes.
        * **Suspicious user agents or referrers:**  Attackers might use specific tools or scripts that leave identifiable patterns in logs.
    * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  IDS/IPS can detect web shell activity based on signatures, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis.
    * **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** FIM systems will alert on the creation or modification of files in monitored directories, including the upload of new web shell scripts.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  SIEM systems can aggregate logs from various sources (web servers, firewalls, IDS/IPS, FIM) and correlate events to detect web shell activity and other security incidents.
    * **Regular Malware Scanning:** Periodically scan the Drupal file system for known web shell signatures using malware scanners.
    * **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitor system behavior for unusual processes, network connections, or resource usage that might indicate web shell activity.

* **Real-world Examples and Scenarios:**

    * **Drupalgeddon 2 (CVE-2017-6385):** This vulnerability allowed unauthenticated remote code execution. After exploiting this vulnerability, attackers could easily upload web shells to maintain persistent access.
    * **Exploitation of vulnerable contributed modules:** Many contributed Drupal modules have had vulnerabilities, including file upload flaws or code injection points, which could be exploited for RCE and subsequent web shell upload.
    * **Misconfigured file permissions:**  If `sites/default/files/` or other directories are inadvertently made writable by the web server, attackers gaining even limited access could upload web shells.

* **Impact Assessment:**

    * **Critical Impact:** As stated in the attack tree, web shell upload is a critical node. Successful web shell deployment has severe consequences:
        * **Persistent Backdoor Access:**  Web shells provide a persistent backdoor, allowing attackers to regain access even after the initial vulnerability is patched.
        * **Data Breach and Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can use web shells to access sensitive data stored in the Drupal database or file system and exfiltrate it.
        * **Website Defacement:** Web shells can be used to deface the website, damaging reputation and user trust.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can use web shells to launch DoS attacks against the website or other systems.
        * **Malware Distribution:** Web shells can be used to host and distribute malware to website visitors.
        * **Lateral Movement:** Attackers can use compromised Drupal servers as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the internal network.
        * **Complete System Compromise:**  In the worst case, attackers can gain complete control over the compromised server and potentially the entire Drupal infrastructure.

* **Complexity of Execution:**

    * **Medium to High:** While uploading a web shell after RCE is conceptually straightforward, the complexity depends on:
        * **The initial RCE vulnerability:** Exploiting the initial vulnerability might be complex and require specialized skills.
        * **Server configuration:** Server hardening and security measures can make it more difficult to find writable upload locations and bypass security controls.
        * **Detection mechanisms:**  Effective detection mechanisms can alert administrators to web shell upload attempts, potentially interrupting the attack.

* **Skill Level Required:**

    * **Intermediate to Advanced:**  Exploiting RCE vulnerabilities and successfully uploading web shells typically requires intermediate to advanced cybersecurity skills, including:
        * Vulnerability analysis and exploitation.
        * Web application security knowledge.
        * Server administration and operating system knowledge.
        * Scripting and programming skills (for crafting and using web shells).
        * Understanding of attacker tactics and techniques.

**Conclusion:**

The "Web Shell Upload (Post-RCE)" attack path is a critical threat to Drupal applications. While it relies on a preceding RCE vulnerability, its successful execution grants attackers persistent and extensive control over the compromised system.  Prioritizing the prevention of RCE vulnerabilities through diligent patching, secure coding practices, and robust security measures is paramount.  Furthermore, implementing comprehensive detection and mitigation strategies specifically targeting web shell activity is crucial for minimizing the impact of this attack path and maintaining the security and integrity of Drupal applications.
