### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Modify `settings.php` (Database Credentials, etc.)

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Explanation

The core of this attack vector lies in the misconfiguration of file permissions within a Drupal installation. Specifically, if the `sites/default/settings.php` file is writeable by the web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`, `nginx`), it becomes a prime target for malicious actors.

`settings.php` is a critical configuration file in Drupal. It contains sensitive information, including:

* **Database Credentials:**  Username, password, database name, and host for the Drupal database.
* **Site Configuration:**  Base URL, trusted host patterns, and other site-specific settings.
* **Salt Keys:**  Used for cryptographic operations and password hashing.
* **Include Files:**  Mechanism to include additional PHP files, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.

If an attacker gains write access to this file, they can directly manipulate these settings. This is a highly privileged position, effectively granting them control over the Drupal application and potentially the underlying server.

#### 4.2. Prerequisites for Successful Exploitation

For this attack path to be successful, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. **Incorrect File Permissions:** The `sites/default/settings.php` file must have write permissions granted to the web server user or group. This is a common misconfiguration, often occurring due to:
    * **Initial Installation Errors:**  Incorrect permissions set during the Drupal installation process.
    * **Accidental Permission Changes:**  Administrators or scripts inadvertently changing file permissions.
    * **Compromised Web Server:**  If the web server itself is compromised, the attacker may gain the ability to modify file permissions.
2. **Web Server User Context:** The attacker needs to be able to execute actions as the web server user. This could be achieved through:
    * **Direct Web Server Compromise:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the web server software itself.
    * **Web Application Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting other vulnerabilities in the Drupal application or other web applications running on the same server that allow for code execution as the web server user.
    * **Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI) (Less Direct):** In some scenarios, LFI/RFI vulnerabilities could be chained to potentially modify files if the web server user has write access.

#### 4.3. Step-by-step Attack Execution

An attacker would typically follow these steps to exploit this vulnerability:

1. **Identify Target Drupal Site:** Locate a Drupal website and determine its version (though not strictly necessary for this attack).
2. **Permission Check (Optional but Recommended):**  Attempt to determine if `sites/default/settings.php` is writeable. This might be done through:
    * **Error Messages (Less Reliable):**  Looking for error messages that might indicate write permission issues (less common).
    * **Trial and Error (More Risky):**  Attempting to modify the file through a web shell or other means (risky and noisy).
    * **Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities (If Present):**  Exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain information about file permissions (more advanced).
3. **Gain Write Access (If Necessary):** If direct write access isn't immediately available, the attacker might need to exploit another vulnerability to gain code execution as the web server user.
4. **Modify `settings.php`:** Once write access is confirmed, the attacker will modify `sites/default/settings.php`. Common modifications include:
    * **Database Credential Theft:**  Read and exfiltrate the database credentials to gain direct database access.
    * **Database Credential Replacement:**  Replace the existing database credentials with attacker-controlled credentials to intercept database connections or deny service.
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution via `include_once`:**  Add an `include_once` statement to include a malicious PHP file hosted remotely or locally (if they can upload it). This allows for arbitrary PHP code execution within the Drupal context.
    * **Site Configuration Manipulation:**  Change site settings like `base_url`, `trusted_host_patterns`, or disable security features.
5. **Exploit Gained Access:**  After modifying `settings.php`, the attacker can leverage the gained access for various malicious purposes, as detailed in the "Impact" section.
6. **Cleanup (Optional):**  Depending on their goals, the attacker might attempt to remove traces of their modification or maintain persistence.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact

The impact of successfully modifying `settings.php` is **Critical**, as stated in the attack tree. This is due to the following severe consequences:

* **Database Breach:**  Gaining access to database credentials allows the attacker to:
    * **Steal Sensitive Data:**  Access and exfiltrate all data stored in the Drupal database, including user information, content, configuration data, and potentially sensitive business data.
    * **Modify Data:**  Alter or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption, misinformation, or denial of service.
    * **Gain Administrative Access:**  Modify user tables to create new administrative accounts or elevate privileges of existing accounts within Drupal.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Including malicious PHP code via `settings.php` allows the attacker to:
    * **Take Full Control of the Web Server:**  Execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user.
    * **Install Backdoors:**  Establish persistent access to the server for future attacks.
    * **Deface the Website:**  Modify website content to display malicious or propaganda messages.
    * **Launch Further Attacks:**  Use the compromised server as a staging point for attacks against other systems.
* **Site Disruption and Denial of Service:**  Modifying site configuration can lead to:
    * **Website Downtime:**  Incorrect configuration can render the website inaccessible.
    * **Functionality Breakdown:**  Disrupt core functionalities of the Drupal application.
    * **Data Loss:**  In extreme cases, incorrect configuration changes could lead to data loss or corruption.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack of this nature can severely damage the reputation of the organization hosting the Drupal website, leading to loss of trust and customer confidence.

#### 4.5. Detection Methods

Detecting attempts to modify `settings.php` or successful modifications is crucial.  Effective detection methods include:

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Implement FIM tools (like `AIDE`, `Tripwire`, or OSSEC) to monitor changes to critical files like `settings.php`. Any unauthorized modification will trigger an alert.
* **Access Logs Analysis:**  Regularly review web server access logs and system logs for suspicious activity related to `settings.php`. Look for:
    * **Unusual POST requests or file access patterns** targeting `settings.php`.
    * **Error messages** indicating permission issues when accessing `settings.php` (though this might be less reliable for detection).
    * **Log entries from unexpected IP addresses** accessing or modifying files.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**  Integrate logs from web servers, FIM tools, and other security systems into a SIEM to correlate events and detect suspicious patterns related to file modifications.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits, including file permission checks, to identify misconfigurations proactively.
* **Version Control System Monitoring:** If `settings.php` is (incorrectly, but sometimes happens) under version control, monitor commit logs for unexpected changes to this file. However, best practice is to *not* commit sensitive information like database credentials to version control.

#### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies

Preventing the "Modify `settings.php`" attack path is paramount.  Effective mitigation strategies include:

* **Correct File Permissions:**  **The most critical mitigation is to ensure `sites/default/settings.php` is NOT writeable by the web server user.**  The recommended permissions are typically read-only for the web server user and writeable only by the user deploying and managing the Drupal application (e.g., the system administrator).  Specifically:
    * **Owner:**  User responsible for Drupal administration (e.g., `root`, or a dedicated Drupal admin user). Permissions: Read, Write.
    * **Group:**  Group responsible for Drupal administration (e.g., `www-data` group, but ideally a more restricted group). Permissions: Read.
    * **Others:**  No permissions (or Read-only if absolutely necessary, but generally no access is best).
    * **Example (Linux):** `chmod 444 sites/default/settings.php` (Read-only for all users, then adjust owner/group as needed and potentially use `chown`).  **Important:** Ensure the *directory* `sites/default` and its parent directories have appropriate permissions to prevent bypassing file permissions by modifying the directory itself.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege to all aspects of the Drupal environment.  Ensure that the web server user has only the necessary permissions to run the application and nothing more.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests targeting `settings.php` or attempting to exploit vulnerabilities that could lead to file modification.
* **Security Hardening:**  Implement general server and Drupal hardening practices, including:
    * **Keeping Drupal Core and Modules Up-to-date:**  Patching known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain web server user access.
    * **Disabling Unnecessary Modules and Features:**  Reducing the attack surface.
    * **Secure Web Server Configuration:**  Following web server security best practices.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.
* **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to automate the deployment and configuration of Drupal environments, ensuring consistent and secure file permissions across all instances.
* **Immutable Infrastructure (Ideal but more complex):**  In more advanced setups, consider using immutable infrastructure principles where the `settings.php` file is part of a read-only deployment package, making direct modification on the live server impossible.

#### 4.7. Real-world Examples (Generalized)

While specific public examples of Drupal sites compromised solely due to writeable `settings.php` might be less frequently publicized directly (as attackers often exploit multiple vulnerabilities), the underlying issue of misconfigured file permissions leading to web application compromise is extremely common.

General real-world examples include:

* **WordPress sites compromised due to writeable `wp-config.php`:**  Similar to Drupal's `settings.php`, WordPress's `wp-config.php` contains database credentials and is a prime target if writeable. Numerous WordPress compromises have stemmed from this misconfiguration.
* **Generic web application compromises due to writeable configuration files:**  Many web applications rely on configuration files that, if writeable by the web server, can be exploited for similar attacks (database access, code execution).
* **Server breaches due to misconfigured permissions:**  Broader server security incidents often involve misconfigured file permissions as a contributing factor, allowing attackers to escalate privileges or gain access to sensitive data.

While not always the *sole* entry point, writeable configuration files are frequently a critical component in successful web application attacks.

#### 4.8. Risk Assessment

* **Likelihood:** **Medium to High**. While best practices dictate read-only permissions for `settings.php`, misconfigurations are unfortunately common, especially during initial setups, manual deployments, or in less mature security environments. Automated deployment processes and security hardening checklists can significantly reduce the likelihood.
* **Impact:** **Critical**. As detailed in section 4.4, the impact of successfully modifying `settings.php` is severe, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Drupal application, database, and even the underlying server.

**Overall Risk:** **High to Critical**.  The combination of a medium to high likelihood and a critical impact results in a high to critical overall risk rating for this attack path. This emphasizes the importance of prioritizing mitigation efforts.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Modify `settings.php` (Database Credentials, etc.)" attack path represents a **critical security vulnerability** in Drupal applications stemming from misconfigured file permissions.  Granting write access to `settings.php` to the web server user is a severe security flaw that can lead to database breaches, arbitrary code execution, site disruption, and significant reputational damage.

**Mitigation is straightforward and essential:**  Ensure `sites/default/settings.php` is **read-only for the web server user** and implement robust file integrity monitoring.  Regular security audits and adherence to Drupal security best practices are crucial for preventing this high-risk attack path and maintaining the security of Drupal applications.  This path should be considered a **top priority** for remediation in any Drupal security hardening effort.
