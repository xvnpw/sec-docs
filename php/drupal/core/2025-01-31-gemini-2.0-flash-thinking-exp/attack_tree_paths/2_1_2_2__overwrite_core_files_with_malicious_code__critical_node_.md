### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.2.2. Overwrite Core Files with Malicious Code

#### 4.1. Attack Description

This attack path focuses on the critical vulnerability arising from writeable Drupal core files. If an attacker can gain write access to files within the `core/` directory or other essential Drupal locations (like `vendor/`, or even root level files like `index.php` in some misconfigurations), they can replace legitimate Drupal code with malicious code. This malicious code can be a backdoor, a webshell, or any script designed to compromise the application and the underlying server.

The core principle is that Drupal, like most PHP applications, executes code directly from the files it reads. By replacing core files, an attacker can inject their own code into the application's execution flow, gaining control at a very fundamental level.

#### 4.2. Prerequisites for Successful Attack

For this attack to be successful, the following prerequisites must be met:

* **Writeable Core Files:** The most critical prerequisite is that the web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`, `nginx`) must have write permissions to the Drupal core files and directories. This is a significant misconfiguration, as core files should ideally be read-only for the web server user after installation and updates.
* **Access to the Server (Direct or Indirect):** Attackers need a way to write to the server's filesystem. This access can be achieved through various means:
    * **Direct Access (Misconfiguration):** In severely misconfigured environments, the web server user might inherently have write permissions to core directories.
    * **Exploited Vulnerability:** More commonly, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Drupal application, web server, or underlying operating system to gain the necessary permissions to write files. Examples include:
        * **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Drupal's file upload mechanisms or contributed modules to upload malicious files and then move or rename them to overwrite core files.
        * **Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities:**  While less direct, in combination with other misconfigurations or vulnerabilities, LFI/RFI could potentially be leveraged to write to files or execute code that then modifies core files.
        * **Operating System or Web Server Vulnerabilities:** Exploits in the underlying OS or web server software could grant attackers elevated privileges, allowing them to bypass file permission restrictions.
        * **Compromised Account:** If an attacker compromises an administrator account or a server account with write access to the web server files, they can directly modify core files.
        * **Supply Chain Attacks:** In rare cases, compromised dependencies or build processes could lead to malicious code being injected into core files during the application deployment or update process.

#### 4.3. Step-by-Step Attack Process

1. **Identify Writeable Core Files:** Attackers first need to determine if core files are indeed writeable. They might use various techniques:
    * **Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting directory traversal vulnerabilities to list directory contents and check file permissions.
    * **Error Messages:** Triggering errors that reveal file paths and potentially permission information.
    * **Brute-force Attempts:** Attempting to write a small test file to known core directories and checking for success.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Exploiting information disclosure vulnerabilities that might reveal server configurations or file permissions.

2. **Prepare Malicious Code:** Once write access is confirmed, attackers prepare malicious code. This is typically a PHP script designed to:
    * **Establish a Backdoor:** Create a persistent access point for the attacker, allowing them to regain control even if the initial vulnerability is patched.
    * **Execute Arbitrary Commands:** Allow the attacker to run commands on the server, enabling further exploitation, data exfiltration, or system compromise.
    * **Modify Application Behavior:** Alter the application's functionality for malicious purposes, such as redirecting users, injecting malware, or defacing the website.

3. **Upload/Inject Malicious Code (if necessary):** If the attacker is exploiting a vulnerability to gain write access, they will use that vulnerability to upload or inject their malicious code onto the server. For example, through a file upload vulnerability, they would upload a PHP file containing their malicious code.

4. **Overwrite Core File:** The attacker then needs to replace a legitimate Drupal core file with their malicious code. Common targets include:
    * **`index.php` (Drupal Root or `core/`):**  Replacing the main entry point of the application ensures the malicious code is executed on every request.
    * **`core/includes/bootstrap.inc` or other bootstrap files:** These files are loaded early in the Drupal bootstrap process, allowing for deep-level control.
    * **Frequently Executed Module or Theme Files:** Targeting files within commonly used modules or themes can ensure the malicious code is executed regularly.
    * **`vendor/autoload.php`:**  In some scenarios, compromising the autoloader can allow for code injection when classes are loaded.

5. **Trigger Malicious Code Execution:**  Once the core file is overwritten, the attacker simply needs to trigger the execution of that file. This is usually done by:
    * **Accessing the Drupal Website:**  Normal user browsing will trigger the execution of `index.php` or other core files.
    * **Specific Requests:**  Depending on the location of the overwritten file, the attacker might need to craft specific requests to ensure the malicious code is executed.

#### 4.4. Potential Vulnerabilities Exploited

While the primary vulnerability is **file permission misconfiguration (writeable core files)**, attackers often exploit other vulnerabilities to achieve the prerequisite of write access. These secondary vulnerabilities can include:

* **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** Unrestricted file uploads or vulnerabilities in upload handlers in Drupal core or contributed modules.
* **Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities:** Allowing attackers to navigate the file system and potentially access or manipulate files outside of intended directories.
* **Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  While less direct, these can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to achieve file writing.
* **SQL Injection:** In some complex scenarios, SQL injection vulnerabilities could potentially be leveraged to manipulate file system operations (though less common for this specific attack path).
* **Operating System or Web Server Vulnerabilities:** Exploits in the underlying infrastructure that grant elevated privileges.
* **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:** Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms and gain access to administrative functions or server resources.

#### 4.5. Impact of Successful Attack

A successful "Overwrite Core Files with Malicious Code" attack has a **CRITICAL** impact, as indicated in the attack tree. The consequences are severe and can include:

* **Complete Application Control:** Backdoors in core files provide persistent and deep-level access to the entire Drupal application. Attackers can execute arbitrary code, modify application behavior, and bypass security measures.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the Drupal database, configuration files, or file system. This includes user data, credentials, and confidential business information.
* **Website Defacement:** Attackers can easily modify the website's content, defacing it for malicious purposes, damaging reputation and user trust.
* **Server Compromise:** The compromised Drupal application can be used as a stepping stone to compromise the entire server. Attackers can escalate privileges, install malware, and pivot to other systems on the network.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can modify core files to intentionally cause application instability, crashes, or performance degradation, leading to denial of service.
* **Malware Distribution:** The compromised website can be used to distribute malware to visitors, further expanding the attacker's reach and impact.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful and publicized attack can severely damage the organization's reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to financial losses.

#### 4.6. Detection Methods

Detecting this type of attack requires a multi-layered approach:

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM tools (like `AIDE`, `Tripwire`, OSSEC) to regularly monitor the integrity of Drupal core files and directories. Any unauthorized modification should trigger immediate alerts. This is the most direct and effective detection method.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Network and host-based IDS/IPS can detect suspicious activity, such as unusual file access patterns, attempts to write to protected files, or execution of unexpected code.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** SIEM systems can aggregate logs from various sources (web servers, application logs, FIM tools, IDS/IPS) to correlate events and detect suspicious patterns indicative of an attack.
* **Log Analysis:** Regularly analyze web server access logs, error logs, and Drupal watchdog logs for suspicious activity, such as unusual file requests, error messages related to file permissions, or unexpected code execution.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Drupal application and server for known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain write access or facilitate file manipulation.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits to review file permissions, server configurations, and application security settings to identify and remediate potential misconfigurations.
* **Code Reviews:** Review code changes and updates to ensure no malicious code is introduced and that proper file handling and security practices are followed.

#### 4.7. Mitigation Strategies

Preventing "Overwrite Core Files with Malicious Code" attacks requires implementing robust security measures:

* **Correct File Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege):** **This is the most critical mitigation.** Ensure that Drupal core files and directories are **read-only** for the web server user. Only specific directories that require write access for Drupal's functionality (like `sites/default/files`, `tmp`, and potentially `modules/`, `themes/` if updates are managed through the UI - generally discouraged in production) should be writeable. Use appropriate `chown` and `chmod` commands to set correct ownership and permissions.
* **Disable Direct File Editing in Production:** Disable any features in Drupal that allow direct file editing through the administrative interface in production environments. This reduces the attack surface.
* **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Drupal core, contributed modules, and themes up-to-date with the latest security patches. Security updates often address vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain write access.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to protect against common web application attacks, including those that could lead to file uploads, directory traversal, or other vulnerabilities that could be chained to overwrite core files.
* **Secure Server Configuration:** Harden the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and operating system by following security best practices. This includes disabling unnecessary services, restricting access, and applying security patches.
* **Input Validation and Output Encoding:** Implement robust input validation and output encoding throughout the Drupal application to prevent injection vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain write access.
* **Regular Backups:** Maintain regular backups of the Drupal application and database. In case of a successful attack, backups allow for quick restoration to a clean state.
* **Security Hardening Scripts/Tools:** Utilize Drupal hardening scripts or tools that automate the process of securing file permissions, disabling unnecessary features, and applying other security best practices.
* **Principle of Least Privilege (Server Access):** Restrict access to the server and Drupal installation to only authorized personnel. Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for all accounts with server access.
* **Separation of Duties:** Separate administrative roles and responsibilities to limit the potential impact of a compromised account.

#### 4.8. Severity Assessment

**CRITICAL**. As highlighted in the attack tree, this attack path is considered **critical**. Successful exploitation leads to complete application compromise, potentially server compromise, and significant data breach risks.
