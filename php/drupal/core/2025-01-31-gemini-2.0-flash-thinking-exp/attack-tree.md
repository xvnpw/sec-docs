## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Drupal Application (Root Goal) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_drupal_application__root_goal___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate objective. Any successful path in the tree leads to this goal.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the Drupal application, including data, functionality, and potentially the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known Drupal Core Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_drupal_core_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Targeting publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities in specific versions of Drupal core. Attackers rely on administrators not patching their systems promptly.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, and other severe vulnerabilities depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Focusing on vulnerabilities that have been officially announced by the Drupal security team and assigned CVE identifiers. Information about these vulnerabilities and sometimes even exploit code is publicly available.
    * **Impact:** High, as these vulnerabilities are often critical and well-understood, making exploitation easier.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Execute Exploit [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__execute_exploit__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The stage where the attacker uses a developed or publicly available exploit to target a known vulnerability in the Drupal core application.
    * **Impact:**  Successful exploitation can directly lead to system compromise, depending on the vulnerability type.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) Exploits [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1__remote_code_execution__rce__exploits__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Drupal application. This is often the most critical type of vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Critical. RCE allows for complete control of the server, enabling data theft, defacement, malware installation, and further attacks on internal networks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1.1. Unauthenticated RCE [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1_1__unauthenticated_rce__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** RCE vulnerabilities that can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication or login to the Drupal application. These are particularly dangerous as they can be exploited by anyone on the internet.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Immediate and widespread compromise is possible as no access restrictions are in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1.2. Authenticated RCE (Requires initial access) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1_2__authenticated_rce__requires_initial_access___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** RCE vulnerabilities that require the attacker to have some form of authentication to the Drupal application, even if it's a low-privilege account. Attackers might gain initial access through other vulnerabilities or weak credentials.
    * **Impact:** Critical. While requiring initial access, these vulnerabilities still lead to full server compromise once exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1.2.2. Exploit Authenticated RCE Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1_2_2__exploit_authenticated_rce_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The specific action of using an exploit to trigger an authenticated RCE vulnerability after gaining some level of access to the Drupal application.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Leads to full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.2. SQL Injection Exploits [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_2__sql_injection_exploits__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
    * **Impact:** High. Can lead to data breaches (accessing sensitive information, modifying or deleting data), and in some cases, can be chained with other techniques to achieve Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.2.1. Unauthenticated SQL Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_2_1__unauthenticated_sql_injection__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities that can be exploited without requiring authentication.
    * **Impact:** High. Direct access to the database without needing to log in.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.2.2. Authenticated SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_2_2__authenticated_sql_injection__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities that require authentication to exploit.
    * **Impact:** High. Database access after gaining some level of application access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploits (Often for account takeover or further attacks) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_3__cross-site_scripting__xss__exploits__often_for_account_takeover_or_further_attacks___critic_d54927bb.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities where malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users. While often considered less severe than RCE or SQLi, XSS can be used for account takeover, defacement, and to launch further attacks.
    * **Impact:** Medium. Can lead to account compromise (especially administrator accounts), defacement of the website, and redirection of users to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.3.1. Stored XSS in Core Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_3_1__stored_xss_in_core_functionality__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts that are permanently stored in the Drupal database (e.g., in content, comments, user profiles) and executed whenever other users view the affected pages.
    * **Impact:** Medium. Persistent XSS attacks can affect many users over time.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.3.2. Reflected XSS in Core Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_3_2__reflected_xss_in_core_functionality__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts that are reflected back to the user's browser in the response to a request, often through URL parameters. These attacks require tricking users into clicking malicious links.
    * **Impact:** Medium. Reflected XSS attacks are often targeted and require social engineering.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4. Gain Initial Access & Escalate Privileges [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4__gain_initial_access_&_escalate_privileges__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** After successfully exploiting a vulnerability (like RCE or SQLi), attackers often aim to establish persistent access and increase their privileges within the system to gain full control.
    * **Impact:** High - Critical. This stage solidifies the attacker's foothold and allows for long-term control and further malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4.1. Web Shell Upload (Post-RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_1__web_shell_upload__post-rce___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** After achieving Remote Code Execution, attackers often upload a web shell (a script that allows command execution through a web interface) to maintain persistent access even if the initial vulnerability is patched.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Web shells provide a backdoor for persistent access and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4.2. Database Access (Post-SQLi) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_2__database_access__post-sqli___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** After exploiting SQL Injection, attackers directly access the database to extract sensitive information, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the system (e.g., by retrieving password hashes).
    * **Impact:** Critical. Data breaches and potential for further system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4.3. Privilege Escalation within Drupal (Post-Initial Access) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_3__privilege_escalation_within_drupal__post-initial_access___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Once attackers have initial access (e.g., through a low-privilege account or a less critical vulnerability), they attempt to exploit weaknesses in Drupal's permission system or find further vulnerabilities to gain administrative privileges.
    * **Impact:** High. Gaining administrative privileges allows for full control over the Drupal application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Drupal Core Configuration Weaknesses (Less Direct Core Vulnerability, but Core-Related) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_drupal_core_configuration_weaknesses__less_direct_core_vulnerability__but_core-related____555e7f72.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigurations in the Drupal core installation, particularly insecure file permissions on core files and directories. This is less about vulnerabilities in the code itself and more about improper setup or maintenance.
    * **Impact:** High - Critical. Can lead to direct modification of core files, access to sensitive configuration data, and ultimately, system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Insecure File Permissions (Core Files/Directories) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__insecure_file_permissions__core_filesdirectories___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting misconfigured file permissions that allow the web server user to write to critical Drupal core files or directories.
    * **Impact:** High - Critical. Allows attackers to modify core functionality or configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2. Exploit Writeable Core Files [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2__exploit_writeable_core_files__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The action of leveraging writeable permissions on core files to inject malicious code or modify configurations.
    * **Impact:** High - Critical. Direct manipulation of the Drupal core application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.1. Modify `settings.php` (Database Credentials, etc.) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_1__modify__settings_php___database_credentials__etc____high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If `sites/default/settings.php` is writeable by the web server user, attackers can modify this file to gain access to the database credentials, change site settings, or even include malicious PHP code that will be executed.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Direct access to the database and potential for arbitrary code execution by modifying the core configuration file.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.2. Overwrite Core Files with Malicious Code [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_2__overwrite_core_files_with_malicious_code__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If core files within the `core/` directory or other critical locations are writeable, attackers can replace them with backdoors or malicious scripts to gain control of the application.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Backdoors in core files provide persistent and deep-level access to the application.
