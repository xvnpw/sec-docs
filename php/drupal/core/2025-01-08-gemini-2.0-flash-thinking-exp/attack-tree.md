## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access and Control Over the Drupal Application](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_and_control_over_the_drupal_application.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means the attacker has bypassed security measures and can perform actions as if they were a legitimate administrator or have gained significant control over the application's resources and data.
    * **Why Critical:** This node signifies a complete security failure and has the highest possible impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Core Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_core_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents a category of attacks where the attacker leverages publicly known security flaws within the Drupal core code. These vulnerabilities can range from input validation errors to flaws in authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    * **Why Critical:**  Known vulnerabilities are actively targeted by attackers due to the availability of information and exploits. Successful exploitation can have a severe impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_publicly_disclosed_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers actively monitor public sources for newly disclosed vulnerabilities in Drupal core. Upon discovery, they attempt to exploit applications running the vulnerable versions before patches can be applied.
    * **Why Critical:** Publicly known vulnerabilities are prime targets for attackers, especially in the window between disclosure and widespread patching.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Initial Access (e.g., RCE, SQLi)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_initial_access__e_g___rce__sqli_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents the point where the attacker gains their first foothold into the application or server. RCE allows for direct command execution, while SQLi allows for database manipulation.
    * **Why Critical:** Initial access is a crucial step that enables further malicious activities, such as privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or deploying backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Code Execution or Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_execution_or_data_manipulation.md)

**Attack Vector:** By exploiting input validation weaknesses, attackers can inject malicious code (e.g., PHP, JavaScript) that is then executed by the server or client. Alternatively, they can manipulate data within the application's database, leading to unauthorized changes or information disclosure.
    * **Why Critical:** This signifies a significant compromise, allowing attackers to directly control the application's behavior or its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Twig Code for Server-Side Execution](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_twig_code_for_server-side_execution.md)

**Attack Vector:** Drupal uses the Twig templating engine. If user-controlled data is improperly handled within Twig templates, attackers can inject malicious Twig code that is then executed on the server, potentially leading to RCE.
    * **Why Critical:** Successful server-side template injection can directly lead to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Local File Inclusion during Update](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_local_file_inclusion_during_update.md)

**Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in the Drupal update mechanism, specifically Local File Inclusion (LFI), can allow attackers to include and execute arbitrary files present on the server. This could be exploited to execute malicious code.
    * **Why Critical:**  The update process is a privileged operation, and vulnerabilities here can have a severe impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Control through Malicious Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_through_malicious_extensions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in Drupal's core functionality related to installing or managing modules and themes to install malicious extensions. These extensions can then be used to gain control over the application.
    * **Why Critical:** Malicious extensions can provide broad and persistent access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Access Checks or Expose Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_access_checks_or_expose_sensitive_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** By crafting malicious requests or exploiting flaws in Drupal's Entity API, attackers can bypass access control mechanisms and gain access to data they are not authorized to view.
    * **Why Critical:** This can lead to significant data breaches and privacy violations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Alter User Roles or Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/alter_user_roles_or_permissions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Entity API or other core functionalities, attackers can modify user roles and permissions within Drupal, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges.
    * **Why Critical:** Elevating privileges allows attackers to take complete control of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Elevated Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/gain_elevated_privileges.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the result of successfully exploiting vulnerabilities to escalate user privileges within the Drupal application, often leading to administrator access.
    * **Why Critical:** Elevated privileges grant the attacker significant control over the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code during Batch Processing](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_during_batch_processing.md)

**Attack Vector:** Drupal's Batch API allows for processing large amounts of data in chunks. Attackers might inject malicious operations into batch processes that are then executed by the server.
    * **Why Critical:** This can lead to server-side code execution within the context of Drupal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Execution of Malicious Code (via Queue API)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_execution_of_malicious_code__via_queue_api_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Drupal's Queue API allows for asynchronous task processing. Attackers might inject malicious tasks into queues that are subsequently processed, leading to code execution.
    * **Why Critical:** Similar to the Batch API, this can lead to server-side code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** These vulnerabilities allow attackers to bypass the normal authentication process and gain access to the application without providing valid credentials.
    * **Why Critical:**  Authentication bypass provides direct and unauthorized access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Specific Security Features for Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/target_specific_security_features_for_bypass.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers might identify vulnerabilities within Drupal's built-in security features or commonly used security modules and find ways to circumvent them.
    * **Why Critical:**  Successfully bypassing security features weakens the application's overall defenses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Core Vulnerability -> Leverage Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability -> Achieve Initial Access](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_core_vulnerability_-_leverage_publicly_disclosed_vulnerability_-_achieve_initial_acces_b4ed83e2.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path relies on the attacker identifying a known vulnerability in the specific version of Drupal core being used by the application. Public vulnerability databases and Drupal security advisories are primary sources for this information. Once a suitable vulnerability is found, the attacker searches for and utilizes publicly available exploits. These exploits are often scripts or crafted requests designed to trigger the vulnerability, leading to initial access. This initial access could be Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, or SQL Injection (SQLi), enabling the attacker to manipulate the database.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This path is considered high-risk due to the relative ease of execution. Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities have readily available information and often working exploits, lowering the barrier to entry for attackers. The impact is very high as it directly leads to initial compromise.
