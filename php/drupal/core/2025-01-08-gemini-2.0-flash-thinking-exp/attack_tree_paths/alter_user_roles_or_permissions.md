## Deep Analysis: Alter User Roles or Permissions Attack Path in Drupal Core

This analysis delves into the attack path "Alter User Roles or Permissions" within a Drupal core application, focusing on the potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Entity API or other core functionalities. As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, my goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of this threat, its implications, and actionable recommendations for prevention and mitigation.

**Attack Tree Path:** Alter User Roles or Permissions

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Entity API or other core functionalities, attackers can modify user roles and permissions within Drupal, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges.

**Why Critical:** Elevating privileges allows attackers to take complete control of the application.

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

This attack path represents a critical security risk due to its potential for complete system compromise. Let's break down the components and implications:

**1. Attack Goal: Alter User Roles or Permissions**

* **Objective:** The attacker's primary goal is to manipulate the Drupal user system to gain unauthorized access and control. This involves changing existing user roles, assigning new roles, or modifying permissions associated with specific roles.
* **Target:** The core Drupal user management system, specifically the tables and logic responsible for storing and managing user roles and permissions.

**2. Attack Vector: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Entity API or other core functionalities**

This is the crucial element outlining *how* the attack is executed. Let's explore potential vulnerability types:

* **Entity API Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Access Control Bypass:**  The Entity API provides a structured way to interact with Drupal data. Vulnerabilities could exist in how access to entity operations (like updating user entities) is controlled. Attackers might exploit flaws in permission checks or bypass mechanisms to modify user role assignments without proper authorization.
    * **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:** If the Entity API allows modification of sensitive fields (like `roles`) without proper filtering or validation, attackers could inject malicious data through forms or API requests to alter user roles.
    * **GraphQL/REST API Vulnerabilities:** If the Drupal instance exposes its entities through APIs, vulnerabilities in these endpoints (e.g., lack of authentication, authorization flaws, parameter tampering) could allow attackers to manipulate user role data.
* **Other Core Functionality Vulnerabilities:**
    * **SQL Injection:**  If input sanitization is insufficient in code paths related to user role management, attackers could inject malicious SQL queries to directly manipulate the `users_roles` table or related database structures.
    * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker could trick an authenticated administrator into performing actions that modify user roles, such as clicking a malicious link or submitting a forged form.
    * **Logic Flaws:**  Subtle errors in the logic of Drupal's permission system or role assignment mechanisms could be exploited to grant unauthorized privileges. For example, a flaw in how roles are inherited or how permissions are evaluated.
    * **Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities might exist where a user with limited privileges can exploit a flaw to gain higher privileges, ultimately allowing them to modify other users' roles.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** While not directly related to the Entity API, a successful authentication bypass vulnerability could grant an attacker access with the privileges of a legitimate user, potentially allowing them to modify roles if that user has the necessary permissions.

**3. Why Critical: Elevating privileges allows attackers to take complete control of the application.**

This highlights the severe consequences of a successful attack:

* **Complete System Takeover:** By gaining administrative privileges (e.g., assigning themselves the "administrator" role), attackers can bypass all access controls and perform any action within the Drupal application.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored within the Drupal database.
* **Website Defacement:** Attackers can alter the website's content, appearance, and functionality.
* **Malware Distribution:** The compromised website can be used to distribute malware to visitors.
* **Service Disruption:** Attackers can disable the website or its critical functionalities, causing significant disruption.
* **Account Compromise:** Attackers can access and control other user accounts, potentially leading to further lateral movement within the system or access to connected services.
* **Backdoor Installation:** Attackers can install persistent backdoors to maintain access even after the initial vulnerability is patched.

**Technical Execution Scenarios:**

Let's consider potential scenarios for how an attacker might execute this attack:

* **Scenario 1: Exploiting an Entity API Vulnerability:**
    1. **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies a publicly known or zero-day vulnerability in the Drupal core Entity API, potentially related to access control or mass assignment.
    2. **Exploitation:** The attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., a POST request to an entity update endpoint) that bypasses access checks and modifies the `roles` field of a target user (e.g., their own account or a new account).
    3. **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker successfully assigns themselves an administrative role.
* **Scenario 2: Exploiting a SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    1. **Identification:** The attacker discovers a vulnerable input field or parameter within a Drupal core module related to user management that is not properly sanitized.
    2. **Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code that directly modifies the `users_roles` table, adding their user ID and the administrator role ID.
    3. **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains administrative privileges upon their next login.
* **Scenario 3: Exploiting a CSRF Vulnerability:**
    1. **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies an administrator user.
    2. **Malicious Request Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page or link containing a form submission that, when executed by the administrator, modifies user roles.
    3. **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks the administrator into clicking the link or visiting the malicious page while they are logged into the Drupal application.
    4. **Privilege Escalation:** The administrator unknowingly triggers the role modification, potentially granting the attacker administrative privileges.

**Detection and Prevention Strategies:**

As a cybersecurity expert, I would advise the development team to implement the following measures:

**Detection:**

* **Robust Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of user actions, especially changes to roles and permissions. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity, such as unexpected role assignments or privilege escalations.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS solutions to detect and potentially block malicious requests targeting known vulnerabilities or exhibiting suspicious patterns.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor core Drupal files and database structures for unauthorized modifications.
* **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Entity API and other core functionalities.
* **User Behavior Analytics (UBA):** Implement UBA tools to detect anomalous user behavior, such as a user suddenly gaining a large number of new permissions.

**Prevention:**

* **Keep Drupal Core and Contributed Modules Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Drupal core and all contributed modules to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Strict Access Control Implementation:** Ensure that access control mechanisms are correctly implemented and enforced throughout the application, especially within the Entity API and user management functionalities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks. Sanitize all user-supplied data before using it in database queries or other sensitive operations.
* **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF tokens and other anti-CSRF measures to prevent attackers from tricking authenticated users into performing unauthorized actions.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid assigning overly broad roles or permissions.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle, including regular code reviews and security training for developers.
* **Security Headers:** Implement security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `X-XSS-Protection` to mitigate various client-side attacks.
* **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments, including static and dynamic analysis, to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
* **Utilize Drupal's Security Features:** Leverage Drupal's built-in security features, such as the permission system and the security review module.

**Mitigation Strategies (If an attack occurs):**

* **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to handle security breaches effectively.
* **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately isolate the compromised Drupal instance to prevent further damage or spread of the attack.
* **Identify the Attack Vector:** Analyze logs and system activity to determine how the attacker gained access and modified user roles.
* **Remove Malicious Accounts and Permissions:** Revoke any unauthorized roles and permissions granted to the attacker. Remove any malicious user accounts.
* **Restore from Backup:** If possible, restore the Drupal application from a clean and trusted backup.
* **Patch the Vulnerability:** Identify and patch the vulnerability that allowed the attack to occur.
* **Review Security Measures:** Re-evaluate existing security measures and implement necessary improvements to prevent future attacks.
* **Notify Affected Parties:** Depending on the severity of the breach and applicable regulations, notify affected users and relevant authorities.
