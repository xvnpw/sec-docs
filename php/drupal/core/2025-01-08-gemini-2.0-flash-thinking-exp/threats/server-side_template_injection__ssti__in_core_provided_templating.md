## Deep Analysis: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Drupal Core Templating

This document provides a deep analysis of the Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) threat within Drupal's core templating engine (Twig), as described in the provided threat model. This analysis is intended for the development team to understand the intricacies of the threat, its potential impact, and the necessary steps for mitigation and prevention.

**1. Understanding Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**

SSTI is a vulnerability that arises when user-controllable data is embedded into template code and then processed by the template engine. Unlike Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI), which executes in the user's browser, SSTI executes directly on the server. This makes it a much more severe threat, as it grants attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's environment.

In the context of Drupal and Twig, this means an attacker could potentially inject malicious Twig syntax into data that is subsequently rendered by the Twig engine. If the injected syntax contains code that interacts with the underlying server or operating system, it can lead to complete system compromise.

**2. How SSTI Manifests in Drupal's Twig Implementation:**

While Drupal core developers are generally cautious about directly embedding user input into Twig templates, vulnerabilities can still arise in several ways:

* **Improper Handling of User-Provided Data in Custom Modules/Themes:**  The most common scenario is within custom modules or themes where developers might inadvertently pass user-controlled data directly into the `render()` function without proper sanitization or escaping. While this is not a *core* vulnerability in the strictest sense, it leverages the core templating engine and can be triggered through user interaction with the application.
* **Vulnerabilities in Core Modules or Contrib Modules:**  Less frequent, but still possible, are vulnerabilities within Drupal core modules or contributed modules where data intended for display is not properly sanitized before being passed to the Twig engine. This could involve data fetched from external sources or manipulated within the application logic.
* **Configuration Settings and Database Content:**  In certain scenarios, configuration settings or content stored in the database might be rendered through Twig. If an attacker can manipulate these settings or content (e.g., through an unrelated vulnerability like SQL Injection), they could inject malicious Twig code.
* **Exploiting Twig Features:**  Certain powerful features within Twig, while intended for legitimate use, could be abused if user input is directly incorporated into template expressions without careful consideration. For example, access to global variables or filters could be exploited.

**3. Technical Deep Dive into the Attack Mechanism:**

The core of the SSTI attack lies in exploiting the functionality of the Twig template engine. Twig allows for the execution of expressions and logic within templates using specific delimiters (e.g., `{{ ... }}`).

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a scenario where a custom module displays a user's name in a welcome message. A vulnerable implementation might look like this:

```php
// In a custom module's controller or block
$name = \Drupal::request()->get('name'); // Get user input from the URL
$build['welcome_message'] = [
  '#type' => 'inline_template',
  '#template' => 'Hello {{ name }}!',
  '#context' => [
    'name' => $name,
  ],
];
```

If an attacker crafts a URL like `example.com?name={{ system('whoami') }}`, the Twig engine will process the `{{ system('whoami') }}` part as a Twig expression. The `system()` function, if accessible within the Twig environment (which is often the case by default or through misconfiguration), will execute the `whoami` command on the server.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Template Syntax:** Attackers leverage Twig's syntax for accessing variables, performing operations, and potentially calling functions.
* **Object Access:** Twig allows access to object properties and methods. If the Twig environment provides access to objects with sensitive functionalities, these can be exploited.
* **Filters and Functions:** Twig provides filters and functions for manipulating data. While many are safe, some could be misused in an SSTI context if they allow interaction with the underlying system.
* **Sandbox Evasion:**  Sophisticated attacks might attempt to bypass any security measures or sandboxing implemented within the Twig environment to gain broader access.

**4. Impact Assessment - Beyond the Description:**

While the description accurately outlines the severe impact, let's delve deeper:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical consequence. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, allowing them to:
    * **Install Malware:** Introduce backdoors, trojans, or ransomware.
    * **Steal Sensitive Data:** Access databases, configuration files, user data, and API keys.
    * **Modify or Delete Data:** Disrupt the application's functionality and potentially cause significant damage.
    * **Pivot to Internal Networks:** Use the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the organization's network.
* **Data Breach:**  Access to sensitive data can lead to severe financial and reputational damage, regulatory fines, and loss of customer trust.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could execute resource-intensive commands to overload the server and make the application unavailable.
* **Website Defacement:**  While less severe than RCE, attackers could modify the website's content to display malicious messages or propaganda.
* **Lateral Movement:** In a more complex infrastructure, a compromised Drupal server could be used to gain access to other systems and applications.

**5. Detailed Examination of Mitigation Strategies and Additional Recommendations:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but we can expand on them:

* **Keep Drupal Core Updated:**
    * **Why it's crucial:** Security updates often include patches for known vulnerabilities, including potential SSTI flaws in core or contributed modules.
    * **Best Practices:** Implement a robust update process, including testing updates in a staging environment before deploying to production. Subscribe to security advisories and be proactive in applying patches.
* **Ensure Proper Escaping of Variables within Twig Templates (Primarily for Drupal Core Developers):**
    * **Explanation:** Escaping prevents the interpretation of special characters in user-provided data as code. Twig provides various escaping strategies (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS).
    * **Core Developer Responsibility:**  Drupal core developers must ensure that all user-provided data or data originating from potentially untrusted sources is properly escaped before being rendered in Twig templates.
* **Regularly Audit the Core Templating Code (Primarily for Drupal Core Developers):**
    * **Importance:** Code audits can identify potential vulnerabilities that might have been missed during development.
    * **Methods:** Utilize static analysis tools, perform manual code reviews, and engage security experts for penetration testing.

**Additional Mitigation and Prevention Strategies for the Development Team:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Crucial Step:**  Validate and sanitize all user input *before* it reaches the templating engine. This includes checking data types, formats, and lengths, and removing or escaping potentially malicious characters.
    * **Contextual Sanitization:**  Apply different sanitization techniques based on the context where the data will be used.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Application Level:**  Run the web server process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.
    * **Twig Environment:**  If possible, configure the Twig environment to restrict access to potentially dangerous functions or objects. While Drupal's default Twig implementation might not offer granular control over this, consider exploring extensions or custom solutions if needed.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Defense in Depth:** While not a direct mitigation for SSTI, CSP can help prevent the execution of malicious scripts injected through other vulnerabilities that might be chained with SSTI.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * **Detection and Blocking:** Implement a WAF to detect and block common attack patterns, including those associated with template injection. Configure the WAF with rules specific to SSTI.
* **Security Awareness Training for Developers:**
    * **Education is Key:**  Educate developers about the risks of SSTI and secure coding practices for template rendering.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools:**
    * **Automated Analysis:**  Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan code for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools:**
    * **Runtime Testing:**  Use DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in a running application.
* **Regular Penetration Testing:**
    * **Expert Evaluation:** Engage security professionals to conduct regular penetration tests to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including SSTI.
* **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**
    * **Early Detection:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual activity, such as attempts to access system commands or unexpected template rendering errors.

**6. Responsibilities and Collaboration:**

* **Drupal Core Developers:**  Responsible for ensuring the security of the core templating engine and providing secure APIs for module and theme developers. This includes proper escaping within core templates and mitigating potential vulnerabilities within Twig's integration with Drupal.
* **Development Team (Custom Modules and Themes):**  Responsible for securely handling user input and ensuring that data passed to the Twig engine is properly sanitized and escaped. This requires a deep understanding of Twig's security implications and adherence to secure coding practices.
* **Security Team:**  Responsible for providing guidance on secure development practices, conducting security audits and penetration tests, and implementing security tools like WAFs.

**Effective mitigation requires close collaboration between all teams.** Developers need to be aware of the potential risks and follow secure coding guidelines, while the security team provides expertise and tools to identify and prevent vulnerabilities.

**7. Conclusion:**

Server-Side Template Injection in Drupal's core templating engine is a critical threat that can lead to complete system compromise. While Drupal core developers take precautions, vulnerabilities can still arise, particularly in custom modules and themes. A multi-layered approach to security is crucial, including keeping Drupal core updated, implementing robust input validation and sanitization, utilizing security tools, and fostering a security-aware development culture.
