# Threat Model Analysis for drupal/core

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Core](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__in_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability within Drupal core's PHP code. They craft a malicious request or input that, when processed by Drupal, allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could involve exploiting insecure deserialization, unsafe file handling, or flaws in input sanitization within core functions.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Drupal installation and potentially the underlying server. The attacker can steal sensitive data, install malware, deface the website, or use the server for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Core PHP codebase (various functions and modules).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Drupal core updated to the latest version.
*   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests.
*   Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular code reviews of core contributions (primarily for Drupal core developers).

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Core Modules](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_core_modules.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages flaws in core database abstraction layers or within core modules that directly interact with the database. They inject malicious SQL code into input fields or URLs, which is then executed by the database, potentially allowing them to bypass security checks, access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary database commands.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (user credentials, personal information, application data), data manipulation or deletion, potential for privilege escalation within the database.

**Affected Component:** Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL), core modules interacting with the database (e.g., User module, Node module).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Drupal core updated to the latest version.
*   Ensure proper use of Drupal's database API (e.g., using prepared statements and parameterized queries) within core code (primarily for Drupal core developers).
*   Regularly audit core code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities (primarily for Drupal core developers).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Core Functionality](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_targeting_core_functionality.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits resource-intensive core features or vulnerabilities that can be triggered by a malicious actor. They send a large number of requests or specially crafted requests that overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network), making the application unavailable to legitimate users. This could involve exploiting inefficient database queries within core, infinite loops in core code, or vulnerabilities in core caching mechanisms.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, disruption of services, potential financial losses due to downtime, damage to reputation.

**Affected Component:** Various core modules and functionalities (e.g., caching system, request handling, database interaction).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Drupal core updated to the latest version.
*   Implement rate limiting and request throttling at the web server or application level.
*   Optimize database queries and caching configurations within Drupal core.
*   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to absorb some of the traffic.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Core](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities_in_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits flaws in Drupal's core authentication system. This could allow them to bypass the login process and gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative functionalities without providing valid credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential for data breaches, ability to perform actions as other users, including administrative actions.

**Affected Component:** User Authentication System (User module, session management).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Drupal core updated to the latest version.
*   Enforce strong password policies.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
*   Regularly review and audit the core authentication code (primarily for Drupal core developers).

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities in Core](./threats/privilege_escalation_vulnerabilities_in_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited privileges exploits weaknesses in Drupal's core permission system. This allows them to gain access to functionalities or data that should be restricted to higher-level users or administrators, potentially granting them unauthorized control over the application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and administrative functionalities, ability to modify critical configurations, potential for full site compromise.

**Affected Component:** Permission System (User module, access control mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Drupal core updated to the latest version.
*   Carefully review and configure user roles and permissions.
*   Regularly audit the core permission management code (primarily for Drupal core developers).

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Core Provided Templating](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_core_provided_templating.md)

**Description:** Flaws in Drupal's core templating engine (Twig) could allow attackers to inject malicious code into templates. When these templates are rendered, the injected code is executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Drupal installation and potentially the underlying server. The attacker can steal sensitive data, install malware, deface the website, or use the server for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Core Templating Engine (Twig).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Drupal core updated to the latest version.
*   Ensure proper escaping of variables within Twig templates within core (primarily for Drupal core developers).
*   Regularly audit the core templating code (primarily for Drupal core developers).
