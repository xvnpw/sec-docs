Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Configuration Tampering via Admin Interface" threat for a Drupal application, following a structured approach:

## Deep Analysis: Configuration Tampering via Admin Interface (Drupal)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Configuration Tampering via Admin Interface" threat, identify specific attack vectors, assess the potential impact on a Drupal application, and propose comprehensive mitigation strategies beyond the initial suggestions.  The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the security posture of the application.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses specifically on the threat of unauthorized configuration changes made through Drupal's administrative interface (`/admin` and related paths).  It considers various Drupal core components and common contributed modules that might be affected by such tampering.  It *does not* cover threats originating from direct database manipulation, server-level compromises, or vulnerabilities in custom code (unless those vulnerabilities are directly exploitable *because* of a configuration change).  The analysis assumes a standard Drupal installation with common security best practices *not* fully implemented.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the provided threat description and impact assessment.
    2.  **Attack Vector Enumeration:**  Identify specific ways an attacker with administrative access could tamper with the configuration to achieve malicious goals.  This will involve exploring various Drupal administrative sections and settings.
    3.  **Impact Analysis (Deep Dive):**  For each attack vector, detail the specific consequences, including potential data breaches, system compromise, and business impact.
    4.  **Mitigation Strategy Enhancement:**  Expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing more specific and actionable recommendations, including Drupal-specific modules and configuration options.
    5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Identify any remaining risks after implementing the proposed mitigations.

### 2. Threat Modeling Review (Confirmation)

The initial threat model provides a good starting point.  The description, impact, affected components, and risk severity (High) are accurate.  The initial mitigation strategies are valid but require further elaboration.

### 3. Attack Vector Enumeration

An attacker with administrative access can perform a wide range of malicious configuration changes. Here are some specific examples, categorized for clarity:

**A. User and Permission Manipulation:**

*   **Creating New Admin Users:**  The attacker could create a new user account with full administrative privileges, providing a persistent backdoor even if the original compromised account is secured.
*   **Elevating Existing User Roles:**  The attacker could grant administrative roles to an existing, seemingly low-privilege user account.
*   **Modifying Role Permissions:**  The attacker could subtly alter the permissions of existing roles (e.g., granting the "authenticated user" role access to sensitive administrative functions).
*   **Disabling User Security Modules:**  Modules like `flood_control` or those enforcing password policies could be disabled, making brute-force attacks easier.

**B. Security Module and Setting Manipulation:**

*   **Disabling Security Modules:**  Modules like `security_review`, `paranoia`, or custom security modules could be disabled, removing crucial security checks.
*   **Weakening Input Filters:**  The attacker could modify input filter settings (e.g., in `admin/config/content/formats`) to allow potentially dangerous HTML tags or JavaScript, enabling stored XSS attacks.
*   **Enabling PHP Filter (Highly Dangerous):**  If the PHP filter module is enabled (it should *never* be enabled on a production site), the attacker could inject arbitrary PHP code into content, leading to full server compromise.
*   **Changing File System Permissions (Indirectly):**  While Drupal doesn't directly manage server file permissions, configuration changes (e.g., to file upload settings) could indirectly lead to insecure file permissions.
*   **Disabling HTTPS Redirect:**  The attacker could disable any configuration that forces HTTPS, making the site vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Changing Error Reporting Settings:**  The attacker could modify error reporting settings to expose sensitive information to the public.

**C. Content and Appearance Manipulation:**

*   **Modifying Themes and Templates:**  The attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into theme settings or template files, leading to XSS attacks or website defacement.
*   **Altering Site Information:**  The attacker could change the site name, slogan, or contact information to mislead users or damage the site's reputation.
*   **Enabling/Disabling Modules that Affect Functionality:**  Disabling modules like Views or Panels could break critical site functionality.

**D. System Configuration Changes:**

*  **Changing the base URL:** Redirecting the website to a malicious domain.
*  **Modifying Cron Settings:**  The attacker could disable or alter cron jobs, potentially disrupting essential site maintenance tasks or security updates.
*  **Changing Database Credentials (Highly Unlikely but Possible via Custom Modules):** If a custom module stores database credentials in the Drupal configuration (a very bad practice), the attacker could modify them, potentially gaining access to the database.

### 4. Impact Analysis (Deep Dive)

The impact of each attack vector varies, but all are significant:
