# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proactive Patching and Updates (Drupal Core & Modules)](./mitigation_strategies/proactive_patching_and_updates__drupal_core_&_modules_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Establish and follow a rigorous update schedule for Drupal core and contributed modules, leveraging Drupal's update mechanisms.

**Description:**
1.  **Subscribe:** Subscribe to the Drupal Security Advisories mailing list and RSS feed.
2.  **Schedule:** Set a recurring calendar reminder (e.g., every Tuesday) to check for updates.
3.  **Check (Drupal-Specific):** Use `drush pm-updatestatus` (if using Drush) or the Drupal admin UI ("Reports" -> "Available updates") to list available updates.  These are Drupal-specific tools.
4.  **Prioritize:** Identify security updates (marked as such within the Drupal UI or Drush output). Prioritize "Highly Critical" and "Critical" updates.
5.  **Backup (Drupal-integrated):** Use Drupal's Backup and Migrate module (if installed) or `drush sql-dump` to create a database backup.
6.  **Staging:** Apply updates to a staging environment *first*.
7.  **Test:** Thoroughly test the staging environment.
8.  **Deploy (Drupal-Specific):** Use `drush updb` (if using Drush) or the Drupal admin UI ("Run database updates") to apply database updates. Use `drush deploy` to apply configuration changes.
9.  **Monitor:** Monitor the production environment.
10. **Rollback (Drupal-integrated):** If issues arise, use `drush sql-cli < backup.sql` (if using Drush) or restore the database backup through your hosting provider's tools. Use `drush deploy:rollback` to revert configuration changes.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):** Vulnerabilities in Drupal core or modules.
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical):** Flaws in Drupal core or modules.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High/Critical):** Vulnerabilities in Drupal core or modules.
    *   **Access Bypass (High/Critical):** Bugs in Drupal core or modules.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium/High):** Vulnerabilities in Drupal core or modules.

**Impact:** (Same as before - risk reduction to Low for most threats with timely updates)

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - adjust to your project)
    *   Updates are checked monthly via the Drupal admin UI.
    *   Backups are taken before major version upgrades using `drush sql-dump`.
    *   A staging environment exists.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - adjust to your project)
    *   No automated update checks.
    *   No weekly/bi-weekly schedule.
    *   Staging environment is not consistently used for *all* updates.
    *   No formal rollback plan using `drush deploy:rollback`.
    *   No subscription to Drupal Security Advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Module Selection and Vetting (Drupal.org Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/module_selection_and_vetting__drupal_org_focus_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully select and vet contributed modules from Drupal.org; review custom module code using Drupal coding standards.

**Description:**
1.  **Needs Assessment:** Define required functionality.
2.  **Drupal.org Review:** On Drupal.org, examine the module's project page:
    *   "Last updated" date.
    *   "Maintenance status" and "Development status."
    *   "Reported by" section for security issues.
    *   "Usage statistics."
    *   Verify if the module is covered by the Drupal Security Team. This is a Drupal-specific security program.
3.  **Alternative Consideration:** Compare modules on Drupal.org.
4.  **Custom Module Review (Drupal Standards):**
    *   Follow Drupal coding standards and security best practices (https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards). This is Drupal-specific guidance.
    *   Conduct code reviews, focusing on Drupal API usage for input validation, output encoding, and access control.
    *   Use static analysis tools configured for Drupal (e.g., PHPStan with Drupal extensions).
5. **Regular Audit:** Review enabled modules using the Drupal admin UI ("Extend").

**List of Threats Mitigated:** (Same as before)

**Impact:** (Same as before)

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   Basic review of module project pages on Drupal.org is done.
    *   Custom modules undergo *some* code review.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   No formal process for needs assessment.
    *   No regular audit of enabled modules via the Drupal UI.
    *   No use of static analysis tools configured for Drupal.
    *   No consistent check for Drupal Security Team coverage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Filtering and Output Encoding (Drupal API Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/input_filtering_and_output_encoding__drupal_api_usage_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Consistently use Drupal's API for handling user input and output encoding, and configure text formats within Drupal.

**Description:**
1.  **Form API:** Use Drupal's Form API for *all* forms.
2.  **Text Formats (Drupal Configuration):** Configure text formats (Admin -> Configuration -> Content authoring -> Text formats and editors) to limit allowed HTML tags. Use the "Limit allowed HTML tags and correct faulty HTML" filter. This is a Drupal core feature. Avoid "Full HTML."
3.  **Output Encoding (Drupal API):**
    *   Use `check_plain()` (Drupal 7) or Twig's `|e` filter (Drupal 8+).
    *   Use `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Xss::filter()` or Twig's `|raw` filter *only after* proper filtering.
    *   Use `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Html::escape()`.
4.  **Render Arrays:** Use Drupal's render array system.
5.  **Custom Code (Drupal API):** In custom modules and themes, *always* use the Drupal API functions.
6. **Disable PHP Filter (Drupal Module):** Disable the PHP filter module (Admin -> Extend) unless absolutely essential. This is a Drupal-specific module.

**List of Threats Mitigated:** (Same as before)

**Impact:** (Same as before)

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   Drupal's Form API is used.
    *   Text formats are configured in the Drupal admin UI.
    *   Twig's `|e` filter is generally used.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   Some custom modules might not consistently use the Drupal API.
    *   "Full HTML" is available to some roles.
    *   No comprehensive review of all custom code.
    *   PHP Filter module is enabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Access Control (Drupal Roles and Permissions)](./mitigation_strategies/access_control__drupal_roles_and_permissions_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement the principle of least privilege using Drupal's role-based access control system and Drupal's permission management.

**Description:**
1.  **Role Definition (Drupal UI):** Create distinct user roles (Admin -> People -> Roles) based on required access.
2.  **Permission Assignment (Drupal UI):** Assign *only* necessary permissions to each role (Admin -> People -> Permissions). This is Drupal's core permission system.
3.  **User Assignment (Drupal UI):** Assign users to roles (Admin -> People).
4.  **Regular Review (Drupal UI):** Review user roles and permissions (Admin -> People -> Permissions).
5.  **Custom Access Control (Drupal Hooks):** If needed, use Drupal's hook system (`hook_node_access()`, `hook_entity_access()`) to implement custom logic. These are Drupal-specific hooks.
6. **Restrict Directory Access (using .htaccess generated by Drupal):** Ensure that directories like `/sites/default/files` are not directly accessible. Drupal usually generates a `.htaccess` file in this directory with some basic protection; review and enhance it if necessary.

**List of Threats Mitigated:** (Same as before)

**Impact:** (Same as before)

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   Basic roles are defined in the Drupal UI.
    *   Permissions are assigned in the Drupal UI.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   No regular review of roles and permissions via the Drupal UI.
    *   Some roles might have excessive permissions.
    *   No custom access control logic using Drupal hooks.
    *   `.htaccess` file in `/sites/default/files` not reviewed.
