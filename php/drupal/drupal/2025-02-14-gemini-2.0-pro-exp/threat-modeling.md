# Threat Model Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Threat: [Core File Tampering via Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/core_file_tampering_via_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Drupal core (e.g., a previously unpatched 0-day or a known vulnerability in an outdated version) to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.  This could involve uploading a malicious file, modifying an existing file (like `index.php` or `.htaccess`), or injecting code into a database entry that is later executed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete site compromise.
    *   Data theft (including user data, configuration, and potentially sensitive business information).
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Use of the server for malicious purposes (e.g., sending spam, launching DDoS attacks).
    *   Installation of backdoors for persistent access.
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Core (specifically, vulnerable functions or modules within core that handle file uploads, input sanitization, or code execution). Examples include, but are not limited to, vulnerable versions of the Form API, REST API, or file handling functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate:** Apply security updates for Drupal core as soon as they are released.  Subscribe to Drupal security advisories.
    *   **Preventative:**
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests.
        *   Use a file integrity monitoring system (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes to core files.
        *   Restrict file system permissions to the absolute minimum.
        *   Disable PHP execution in directories where user-uploaded files are stored (e.g., `sites/default/files`).
        *   Regularly audit the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via Admin Interface](./threats/configuration_tampering_via_admin_interface.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a Drupal administrator account (through phishing, password guessing, or session hijacking) and modifies the site's configuration.  They might disable security modules, change user roles, enable insecure features, or alter the site's appearance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Weakening of site security.
    *   Exposure of sensitive data (if configuration settings are changed to reveal information).
    *   Disruption of site functionality.
    *   Defacement or redirection of the website.
    *   Potential for further attacks (e.g., enabling a vulnerable module).
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Core's administrative interface (`/admin`), including various configuration forms and settings pages.  Specific components affected depend on the changes made by the attacker (e.g., user roles, permissions, enabled modules, theme settings).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate:**  Change the password of the compromised account.  Review and revert any unauthorized configuration changes.
    *   **Preventative:**
        *   Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrator accounts.
        *   Restrict access to the administrative interface based on IP address (if feasible).
        *   Regularly review user roles and permissions, ensuring the principle of least privilege.
        *   Use Drupal's configuration management system (CMI) to track and manage configuration changes.  Store configuration in version control.
        *   Implement audit logging to track changes made through the administrative interface.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via `settings.php` Misconfiguration](./threats/information_disclosure_via__settings_php__misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** The `sites/default/settings.php` file, which contains sensitive database credentials and other configuration settings, is accidentally made publicly accessible (e.g., due to incorrect file permissions or a misconfigured web server).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of database credentials, allowing attackers to access the database directly.
    *   Exposure of other sensitive configuration settings (e.g., API keys, salts).
    *   Potential for complete site compromise.
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Core's configuration file (`sites/default/settings.php`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate:**  Correct the file permissions to make `settings.php` inaccessible to the web server user and the public.
    *   **Preventative:**
        *   Ensure that `settings.php` has the correct file permissions (typically 640 or 440, owned by the file owner and not writable by the web server user).
        *   Store `settings.php` outside of the web root (if possible).
        *   Use environment variables to store sensitive configuration settings instead of hardcoding them in `settings.php`.
        *   Regularly review file permissions and web server configuration to ensure that sensitive files are not exposed.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Role Misconfiguration](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_role_misconfiguration.md)

* **Description:** A user with limited privileges (e.g., a "subscriber" role) is able to perform actions or access content restricted to higher-privileged roles (e.g., "editor" or "administrator") due to misconfigured permissions in Drupal's role-based access control system. This is not a code vulnerability, but a configuration error.
* **Impact:**
    * Unauthorized access to sensitive content or functionality.
    * Ability to modify or delete content the user should not have access to.
    * Potential for further privilege escalation if the user can modify other user roles or permissions.
* **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Core's user module (`user`) and the permissions system, accessed via `/admin/people/permissions`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Immediate:** Review and correct the misconfigured permissions. Revoke any unintended access.
    * **Preventative:**
        * Carefully plan and implement user roles and permissions, following the principle of least privilege.
        * Regularly audit user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate.
        * Thoroughly test user roles and permissions to ensure they are working as expected. Use different user accounts with different roles to test access.
        * Use modules like `Role Delegation` to manage complex permission scenarios and avoid granting overly broad permissions.

## Threat: [Update Mechanism Tampering (Man-in-the-Middle)](./threats/update_mechanism_tampering__man-in-the-middle_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the Drupal site and the update server (drupal.org) during a core or module update. They replace the legitimate update package with a malicious one, effectively installing a backdoored version of Drupal or a module.
* **Impact:**
    * Installation of malicious code.
    * Complete site compromise.
    * Data theft.
    * Persistent backdoor access.
* **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Core's update manager (`update`) and the underlying mechanisms for fetching and verifying updates (e.g., HTTP requests, file system operations).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Immediate:** If suspected, restore the site from a known-good backup *before* the compromised update. Verify the integrity of all files.
    * **Preventative:**
        * Ensure Drupal's update server communication is secured via HTTPS (this is the default, but verify).
        * Manually verify the checksums of downloaded updates (if provided) before applying them.
        * Use a robust deployment process that includes testing updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.
        * Consider using a local mirror of the Drupal update server (for large organizations with strict security requirements).
