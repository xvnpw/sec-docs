Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Weak Admin Password" attack tree path for a Drupal application, following a structured approach:

## Deep Analysis: Drupal Weak Admin Password Attack Vector

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Weak Admin Password" attack vector against a Drupal application, identifying specific vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and residual risks.  This analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's security posture against this specific threat. We will go beyond the basic description and delve into Drupal-specific considerations.

### 2. Scope

**Scope:** This analysis focuses solely on the "Weak Admin Password" attack vector (node 2.2 in the provided attack tree).  It encompasses:

*   **Drupal Core:**  How Drupal's core password handling mechanisms and default configurations contribute to or mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Common Modules:**  How commonly used Drupal modules (e.g., those related to user management, authentication, or security) might interact with this attack vector.
*   **Custom Code:**  Potential vulnerabilities introduced by custom code that overrides or interacts with Drupal's default password handling.
*   **Hosting Environment:**  How the hosting environment (server configuration, web server, database) might influence the effectiveness of this attack or its mitigation.
*   **User Behavior:** The role of user education and awareness in preventing weak password choices.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Other attack vectors in the broader attack tree (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
*   Attacks targeting the underlying operating system or network infrastructure, *except* where they directly relate to the password attack.
*   Social engineering attacks aimed at obtaining the password directly from the user (this analysis focuses on technical attacks).

### 3. Methodology

**Methodology:** This analysis will employ a combination of techniques:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):** Examining relevant sections of Drupal core code, common module code, and (hypothetically) custom code to identify potential weaknesses related to password storage, validation, and enforcement.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Reviewing known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and security advisories related to Drupal and weak passwords.
*   **Best Practice Review:**  Comparing the application's configuration and implementation against established Drupal security best practices and industry standards (e.g., OWASP).
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Considering various attack scenarios and attacker capabilities to assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation.
*   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**  Describing how a penetration tester might attempt to exploit this vulnerability, including the tools and techniques they might use.  (We won't actually perform penetration testing, but we'll outline the approach).

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.2 Weak Admin Password

#### 4.1. Attack Surface Analysis

*   **Login Form:** The primary attack surface is the Drupal login form (`/user/login`).  This form is publicly accessible by default.
*   **Password Reset Form:** The password reset form (`/user/password`) is another potential attack surface.  If an attacker can guess or obtain a user's email address, they might try to trigger a password reset and intercept the reset link.
*   **XML-RPC/REST API (if enabled):** If Drupal's XML-RPC or REST API is enabled and allows user authentication, these endpoints could also be targeted for brute-force attacks.
*   **Drush (if accessible remotely):**  If Drush (Drupal Shell) is accessible remotely without proper authentication, it could be used to attempt password changes or brute-force attacks.

#### 4.2. Drupal-Specific Vulnerabilities and Considerations

*   **Password Hashing:** Drupal uses the Password Hashing API (PHPass) by default, which is generally considered secure (using bcrypt).  However, older Drupal versions or misconfigured systems might use weaker hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5).  This is a *critical* configuration point to verify.
*   **Password Policy Enforcement:** Drupal core provides basic password policy settings (minimum length, complexity requirements).  However, these settings might be disabled or set to weak values.  The `Password Policy` module provides more granular control.
*   **Flood Control:** Drupal has built-in flood control mechanisms to limit the rate of failed login attempts.  These mechanisms are crucial for mitigating brute-force attacks.  However, they might be misconfigured or bypassed under certain circumstances.  The `Flood Control` module offers additional protection.
*   **Account Lockout:** Drupal can automatically lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.  This is another important defense against brute-force attacks.  The configuration of this feature (number of attempts, lockout duration) needs careful consideration.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Drupal does *not* include 2FA in core.  However, modules like `TFA` (Two-Factor Authentication) are highly recommended.  The absence of 2FA significantly increases the risk of a successful weak password attack.
*   **User Enumeration:** Drupal's default behavior can sometimes reveal whether a username exists.  For example, the password reset form might display a different message if the username is valid versus invalid.  This information can be used by attackers to narrow down their brute-force attempts.  Modules like `Username Enumeration Prevention` can help mitigate this.
*   **Custom Code Issues:** Custom modules or themes that interact with user authentication or password handling could introduce vulnerabilities.  For example, a custom login form might bypass Drupal's built-in security checks.  Careful code review is essential.
* **Old Drupal versions:** Old versions of Drupal may contain vulnerabilities that allow to bypass security mechanisms.

#### 4.3. Attack Scenarios

*   **Basic Brute-Force:** An attacker uses a tool like Hydra or Burp Suite to systematically try common passwords (e.g., "password123," "admin," "123456") against the admin account.
*   **Dictionary Attack:** An attacker uses a list of common passwords (a "dictionary") and attempts to log in with each password.
*   **Credential Stuffing:** An attacker uses a list of usernames and passwords that have been leaked from other websites.  If the Drupal administrator reuses passwords, this attack could be successful.
*   **Targeted Attack:** An attacker gathers information about the administrator (e.g., their name, interests, hobbies) and uses this information to create a custom dictionary of likely passwords.
*   **Password Reset Attack:** An attacker guesses or obtains the administrator's email address and attempts to reset their password.  If the attacker can intercept the password reset email (e.g., through a phishing attack or by compromising the email server), they can gain access to the account.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

*   **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce a strong password policy that requires a minimum length (e.g., 12 characters), a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  Use the `Password Policy` module for granular control.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA using a module like `TFA`.  This adds an extra layer of security that makes it much harder for attackers to gain access, even if they have the password.
*   **Flood Control and Account Lockout:** Ensure that Drupal's built-in flood control and account lockout mechanisms are enabled and properly configured.  Consider using the `Flood Control` module for enhanced protection.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Drupal application, including code reviews, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning.
*   **Update Drupal Core and Modules:** Keep Drupal core and all contributed modules up to date.  Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited in brute-force attacks.
*   **User Education:** Educate users (especially administrators) about the importance of choosing strong passwords and avoiding password reuse.
*   **Monitor Login Attempts:** Monitor failed login attempts and look for patterns that might indicate a brute-force attack.  Use a security information and event management (SIEM) system or a Drupal module like `Login Security` to track and alert on suspicious activity.
*   **Disable XML-RPC/REST API (if not needed):** If the XML-RPC or REST API is not required, disable it to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Secure Drush Access:** If Drush is used, ensure that it is only accessible from trusted IP addresses and requires strong authentication.
*   **Harden Hosting Environment:** Configure the web server and database server securely.  For example, use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic.
*   **Use a Password Manager:** Encourage administrators to use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
*   **Prevent Username Enumeration:** Use a module like `Username Enumeration Prevention` to prevent attackers from determining whether a username exists.

#### 4.5. Residual Risk

Even with all of the above mitigation strategies in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  A new vulnerability in Drupal or a contributed module could be discovered that allows attackers to bypass security measures.
*   **Compromised 2FA:**  If an attacker can compromise the administrator's 2FA device (e.g., their phone), they could still gain access.
*   **Social Engineering:**  An attacker could use social engineering techniques to trick the administrator into revealing their password or 2FA code.
*   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access to the system could change the administrator's password or disable security measures.
*   **Compromised Hosting Environment:** If the hosting environment is compromised (e.g., through a vulnerability in the web server or operating system), the attacker could gain access to the Drupal database and potentially decrypt the administrator's password.

#### 4.6 Penetration Testing Approach (Conceptual)

1.  **Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the target Drupal site, including its version, installed modules, and any publicly available information about the administrator.
2.  **Identify Login Forms:** Locate all login forms, including the default `/user/login` form and any custom login forms.
3.  **Test for Username Enumeration:** Attempt to determine whether the site reveals whether a username exists.
4.  **Brute-Force Attack:** Use a tool like Hydra or Burp Suite to launch a brute-force attack against the administrator account, using a combination of common passwords, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.
5.  **Password Reset Attack:** Attempt to reset the administrator's password by guessing or obtaining their email address.
6.  **Test API Endpoints:** If the XML-RPC or REST API is enabled, attempt to brute-force authentication through these endpoints.
7.  **Test Drush Access:** If Drush is accessible, attempt to use it to change the administrator's password or brute-force authentication.
8.  **Bypass Flood Control:** Attempt to bypass Drupal's flood control mechanisms by using techniques like IP address rotation or slow attack rates.
9.  **Report Findings:** Document all findings, including successful attacks, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for remediation.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Weak Admin Password" attack vector is a significant threat to Drupal applications.  However, by implementing a combination of strong password policies, 2FA, flood control, regular security audits, and user education, the risk of a successful attack can be significantly reduced.  The development team should prioritize these mitigation strategies and continuously monitor the application for signs of attempted attacks.  Regular penetration testing, even conceptually, helps to identify weaknesses and ensure that defenses are effective. The most critical recommendations are:

1.  **Mandatory 2FA for all administrative accounts.** This is the single most effective mitigation.
2.  **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:** Enforce a robust password policy using the `Password Policy` module.
3.  **Regular Updates:** Keep Drupal core and all modules updated to the latest secure versions.
4.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring of login attempts.
5. **Harden Hosting Environment:** Use secure configuration for web server.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Weak Admin Password" attack vector and equips the development team with the knowledge to build a more secure Drupal application.
