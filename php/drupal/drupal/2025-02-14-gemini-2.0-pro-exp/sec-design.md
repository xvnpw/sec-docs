## BUILD

Drupal's build process typically involves managing dependencies, compiling assets, and packaging the code for deployment. While Drupal core itself doesn't have a traditional "build" process in the same way as compiled languages, contributed modules and themes often do.  A common approach is to use Composer for dependency management and a task runner like Gulp or Webpack for asset compilation.  Continuous Integration (CI) systems like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins are often used to automate these processes.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer(("Developer"))
    GitRepository(("Git Repository\n(e.g., GitHub, GitLab)"))
    CIEnvironment(("CI Environment\n(e.g., GitHub Actions)"))
    Composer(("Composer"))
    AssetCompiler(("Asset Compiler\n(e.g., Gulp, Webpack)"))
    ArtifactRepository(("Artifact Repository\n(e.g., Docker Registry, AWS ECR)"))
    SecurityScanner(("Security Scanner\n(e.g., SonarQube, Snyk)"))

    Developer -- "Commits code" --> GitRepository
    GitRepository -- "Triggers build" --> CIEnvironment
    CIEnvironment -- "Fetches dependencies" --> Composer
    CIEnvironment -- "Compiles assets" --> AssetCompiler
    CIEnvironment -- "Runs security scans" --> SecurityScanner
    CIEnvironment -- "Packages code" --> ArtifactRepository
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.  The commit triggers a build process in a CI environment (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
3.  The CI environment fetches dependencies using Composer.
4.  The CI environment compiles assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) using an asset compiler (e.g., Gulp, Webpack).
5.  The CI environment runs security scans on the codebase and dependencies using tools like SonarQube or Snyk.
6.  If all checks pass, the CI environment packages the code and any build artifacts (e.g., Docker images) and pushes them to an artifact repository (e.g., Docker Registry, AWS ECR).

Security Controls:

*   Dependency management with Composer, including checking for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using tools like SonarQube to identify code vulnerabilities.
*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA) using tools like Snyk to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   Container image security scanning (if applicable) to identify vulnerabilities in Docker images.
*   Automated build process to ensure consistency and repeatability.
*   Use of signed commits to verify the integrity of code changes.
*   Least privilege access control for CI/CD pipelines.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Content delivery and presentation: Ensuring that website content is accessible to users.
*   Content creation and management: Enabling content editors and administrators to create, edit, and publish content.
*   User management: Managing user accounts and access control.
*   E-commerce (if applicable): Processing transactions and managing customer data.
*   Community features (if applicable): Facilitating user interaction and engagement.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User data (e.g., usernames, email addresses, passwords): Sensitive, subject to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   Content data (e.g., articles, pages, comments): Varies in sensitivity, may include confidential or proprietary information.
*   Configuration data (e.g., database credentials, API keys): Highly sensitive, must be protected from unauthorized access.
*   Financial data (if applicable, e.g., credit card numbers, transaction details): Highly sensitive, subject to PCI DSS compliance.
*   Personal data (if applicable): Sensitive, subject to privacy regulations.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific contributed modules and themes are being used? This is crucial for assessing the overall security posture, as third-party code is a significant risk factor.
*   What is the specific deployment environment? (e.g., specific cloud provider, hosting configuration). This is needed for a more detailed deployment diagram and security recommendations.
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
*   What is the expected traffic volume and performance requirements?
*   Are there any integrations with external systems? If so, what are the security considerations for those integrations?
*   What is the process for managing and applying security updates?
*   What is the disaster recovery plan?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to maintain a secure, stable, and performant website.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Drupal core is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Basic security best practices are followed (e.g., strong passwords, regular backups).
*   DESIGN: A standard Drupal installation is used, with a MySQL database.  The deployment environment is a cloud-based infrastructure.  Composer is used for dependency management.
