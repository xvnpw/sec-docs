### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

**2.1 Drupal Core:**

*   **Architecture:** Drupal Core provides the foundation of the CMS, including user management, content management, access control, and the plugin system (modules). It's primarily PHP-based and interacts with a database (MySQL in this case).
*   **Threats:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Although Drupal's database API mitigates this, improper use of custom queries or contributed modules can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Drupal has robust output encoding, but vulnerabilities can arise from improperly sanitized user input or theme vulnerabilities.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Drupal includes CSRF protection, but custom forms or contributed modules might not implement it correctly.
    *   **Access Control Bypass:** Flaws in core modules or misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities in core components could be exploited to make the site unavailable.
    *   **PHP Code Injection:** If an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code, they can gain full control of the server.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Ensure Drupal core is *always* updated to the latest security release.  Automate this process within the Kubernetes deployment (e.g., using a rolling update strategy).
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Even with Drupal's built-in protections, review any custom code that handles user input to ensure it's properly validated and sanitized. Use Drupal's API functions for database interactions *exclusively*.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Verify that all output is properly encoded using Drupal's API functions (e.g., `t()`, `check_plain()`, `filter_xss()`).
    *   **CSRF Token Validation:**  Ensure all forms, especially custom forms, use Drupal's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Configure user roles and permissions according to the principle of least privilege.  Avoid granting unnecessary permissions.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  The recommended WAF (mentioned in the Security Posture) should be configured with rules specifically designed to protect against Drupal vulnerabilities.  On AWS, this would be AWS WAF.
    *   **PHP Configuration:**  Harden the PHP configuration in the container.  Disable unnecessary functions (e.g., `exec`, `system`, `shell_exec`) in `php.ini`.  Set `expose_php = Off`.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the Drupal pods in Kubernetes to prevent DoS attacks.

**2.2 Contributed Modules and Themes:**

*   **Architecture:** These are extensions to Drupal core, written by third-party developers. They can introduce significant functionality but also significant security risks.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **All threats listed for Drupal Core:** Contributed modules can introduce any of the vulnerabilities mentioned above.
    *   **Unmaintained Modules:** Modules that are no longer maintained are more likely to contain unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Malicious Modules:**  A module could be intentionally designed to be malicious.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromise of a module developer's account or the Drupal.org infrastructure could lead to the distribution of malicious code.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Selection:**  *Only* use modules from trusted sources and with a strong track record of security.  Prioritize modules that are actively maintained and have a large user base.  Check the module's project page for security advisories.
    *   **Security Reviews:**  Before installing a new module, conduct a security review of its code, focusing on input validation, output encoding, and access control.  This is *critical*.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep all contributed modules and themes updated to the latest versions.  Automate this process as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool (e.g., Snyk, as mentioned in the build process) to scan for known vulnerabilities in contributed modules and their dependencies.  Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Sandbox Environment:**  Test new modules and updates in a separate, isolated environment (a staging environment within the Kubernetes cluster) before deploying them to production.
    *   **Webform Module Specifics (If Used):** If using the Webform module, pay *extra* attention to its configuration and any custom handlers. Webform is a frequent target for attacks due to its complexity and ability to handle user input.  Ensure file uploads are strictly controlled and validated.
    * **Theme Security:** Ensure themes do not directly output user-provided data without proper sanitization. Avoid using PHP code directly in theme templates where possible.

**2.3 Deployment Environment (AWS Kubernetes - EKS):**

*   **Architecture:** Drupal is deployed as containers within a Kubernetes cluster managed by AWS EKS.  This includes a load balancer (ELB), auto-scaling group (ASG), worker nodes, Drupal pods, an RDS database (MySQL), and EFS for shared storage.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **Container Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in the base image or Drupal container image could be exploited.
    *   **Kubernetes Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured RBAC, network policies, or pod security policies could lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **Network Exposure:**  Exposing the Drupal pods directly to the internet without proper protection.
    *   **Database Exposure:**  Exposing the RDS database to the internet or allowing unauthorized access from the Drupal pods.
    *   **EFS Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured NFS permissions could allow unauthorized access to shared files.
    *   **Compromised Worker Nodes:**  If an attacker gains access to a worker node, they could potentially access other pods or resources in the cluster.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Container Image Security:**
        *   Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine Linux).
        *   Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using a tool like Amazon ECR's built-in scanning or a third-party tool (e.g., Trivy, Clair). Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Use a private container registry (e.g., AWS ECR) to store and manage container images.
        *   Implement image signing and verification to ensure that only trusted images are deployed.
    *   **Kubernetes Security:**
        *   **RBAC:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to Kubernetes resources based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Network Policies:** Use network policies to control traffic flow between pods and to isolate the Drupal pods from other applications in the cluster.  *Specifically*, ensure that only the load balancer can access the Drupal pods on the necessary ports (80/443).
        *   **Pod Security Policies (Deprecated, use Pod Security Admission instead):** Define pod security policies to enforce security best practices for pods, such as preventing privileged containers and restricting access to host resources.  Use the newer Pod Security Admission controller in recent Kubernetes versions.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the Kubernetes configuration for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **EKS Security Best Practices:** Follow AWS's security best practices for EKS, including using IAM roles for service accounts, enabling audit logging, and using security groups to control network access.
    *   **Network Security:**
        *   **Load Balancer:** Configure the ELB to terminate HTTPS and use strong SSL/TLS ciphers.
        *   **Security Groups:** Use security groups to restrict network access to the worker nodes and the RDS database.  Only allow necessary traffic.
        *   **Network ACLs:** Use network ACLs to control traffic flow at the subnet level.
    *   **Database Security:**
        *   **RDS Security Groups:**  Configure the RDS security group to *only* allow inbound connections from the Drupal pods within the private subnet.  *Do not* allow public access.
        *   **Database Encryption:**  Enable encryption at rest for the RDS database.
        *   **Strong Passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for the database user.
        *   **Automated Backups:**  Enable automated backups for the RDS database.
        *   **Automated Patching:** Enable automated patching for the RDS instance.
    *   **EFS Security:**
        *   **NFS Access Control:**  Configure NFS access control to restrict access to the EFS file system to only the Drupal pods.
        *   **Encryption at Rest:**  Enable encryption at rest for the EFS file system.
    *   **Worker Node Security:**
        *   **Regular Patching:**  Regularly patch the worker nodes with the latest security updates. Use managed node groups in EKS to automate this process.
        *   **IAM Roles:**  Use IAM roles to grant the worker nodes the necessary permissions to access AWS resources.
        *   **Security Groups:** Use security groups to restrict network access to the worker nodes.

**2.4 Data Flow:**

*   **Architecture:** User -> Web Server (ELB) -> Drupal Pods (PHP Runtime, Drupal Core, Modules, Themes) -> Database (RDS) / External Systems.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **Data Breaches:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database or transmitted between components.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  Interception of data transmitted between the user and the web server or between Drupal and external systems.
    *   **Data Tampering:**  Modification of data in transit or at rest.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS for all communication between the user and the web server.  Enforce HTTPS using HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security).
    *   **Secure Communication with External Systems:**  Use HTTPS and API authentication/authorization for all communication with external systems.
    *   **Data Encryption at Rest:**  Encrypt sensitive data stored in the database (RDS) and the shared file system (EFS).
    *   **Data Validation:**  Validate all data received from external systems and user input.
    *   **Database Connection Security:** Use a secure connection string and credentials to connect to the database. Store these credentials securely (e.g., using Kubernetes Secrets or AWS Secrets Manager). *Never* hardcode credentials in the Drupal configuration.

**2.5 Build Process:**

*   **Architecture:**  Developer -> Git Repository -> CI Environment (Composer, Asset Compiler, Security Scanner) -> Artifact Repository.
*   **Threats:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:**  Inclusion of third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Vulnerabilities:**  Introduction of security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    *   **Compromised Build Environment:**  An attacker gaining access to the CI environment could inject malicious code or steal secrets.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Use Composer to manage dependencies and regularly update them to the latest versions.  Use `composer audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **SAST:**  Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., SonarQube) into the CI pipeline to identify code vulnerabilities.
    *   **SCA:**  Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools (e.g., Snyk) into the CI pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   **Secure CI Environment:**  Secure the CI environment by following best practices, such as using strong passwords, restricting access, and regularly patching the environment.
    *   **Signed Commits:** Use signed commits to verify the integrity of code changes.
    *   **Least Privilege for CI/CD:** Grant the CI/CD pipeline only the necessary permissions to build and deploy the application.

**2.6 External Systems:**

*  **Architecture:** Drupal Core and Contributed Modules may interact with external systems via API calls.
*  **Threats:**
    * **Compromised External System:** If an external system is compromised, it could be used to attack the Drupal site.
    * **Data Leaks:** Sensitive data sent to external systems could be leaked if the external system is not secure.
    * **Injection Attacks:** If the external system's API is vulnerable to injection attacks, it could be used to inject malicious code into the Drupal site.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Communication:** Use HTTPS for all communication with external systems.
    * **API Authentication and Authorization:** Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect the API endpoints.
    * **Input Validation:** Validate all data received from external systems.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit the security of the external systems and their integrations with Drupal.
    * **Contractual Agreements:** Have clear contractual agreements with the providers of external systems that address security responsibilities.
