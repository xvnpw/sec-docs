## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability (Unpatched) - Core](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_publicly_disclosed_vulnerability__unpatched__-_core.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting a known vulnerability in Drupal core that has been publicly disclosed (e.g., through a Drupal Security Advisory) but has not been patched on the target system. Attackers often scan for systems running vulnerable versions of Drupal.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Exploit code for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities is often readily available, and many websites are slow to apply security updates.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Successful exploitation of a core vulnerability can grant the attacker full administrative access to the Drupal application, allowing them to exfiltrate data, deface the website, or use the server for malicious purposes.
*   **Effort:** Low. Once a vulnerability is disclosed and an exploit is available, the effort required to exploit it is typically low.
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate. While understanding the vulnerability might require some technical knowledge, using pre-built exploits often requires only basic scripting skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Medium. Vulnerability scanners can easily detect unpatched systems. Intrusion detection systems might detect exploit attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Weak Admin Password](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_weak_admin_password.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector involves gaining administrative access by guessing or brute-forcing a weak password for the Drupal administrator account.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Many users still choose weak or easily guessable passwords, despite warnings and best practices.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful compromise of the administrator account grants the attacker full control over the Drupal application.
*   **Effort:** Low. Brute-force attacks can be automated using readily available tools.
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner. Basic scripting skills are sufficient to launch a brute-force or dictionary attack.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy. Failed login attempts can be logged and monitored. Intrusion detection systems can often detect brute-force attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability (Unpatched) - Module](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_publicly_disclosed_vulnerability__unpatched__-_module.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector is similar to 1.2, but it targets vulnerabilities in contributed (third-party) or custom-built Drupal modules. The attacker exploits a known vulnerability that hasn't been patched.
*   **Likelihood:** High. Contributed modules are a frequent source of vulnerabilities, and many websites use a large number of modules, making it challenging to keep them all up-to-date.
*   **Impact:** High/Very High. The impact depends on the specific module and the vulnerability, but it can often lead to full administrative access or other significant compromises.
*   **Effort:** Low. Similar to core vulnerabilities, exploits for module vulnerabilities are often readily available.
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate. The skill level required is similar to exploiting core vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Medium. Vulnerability scanners can detect unpatched modules. Intrusion detection systems might detect exploit attempts.
