# Attack Surface Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Drupal Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_drupal_core_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Known security flaws exist in older versions of Drupal core that attackers can exploit.
    * **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal's core codebase is the foundation of the application. Vulnerabilities within it directly expose the entire application to risk.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses a publicly known exploit for a specific Drupal core vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution flaw) to gain administrative access, install malware, or deface the website.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the website, data breach, data loss, defacement, malware distribution, and reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Drupal core to the latest stable version.
        * Subscribe to Drupal security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        * Implement a process for testing updates in a staging environment before applying them to production.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Contributed Modules and Themes](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_contributed_modules_and_themes.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws can exist in third-party modules and themes that extend Drupal's functionality and appearance.
    * **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal's architecture allows for extensive customization through contributed modules and themes, increasing the attack surface if these components are insecure.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable contributed module allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access sensitive user data or execute arbitrary code. A vulnerable theme might allow for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, website defacement, cross-site scripting attacks, and potential remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only install modules and themes from trusted sources (drupal.org).
        * Regularly update contributed modules and themes.
        * Review the security advisories for contributed modules and themes.
        * Consider the security track record and community support of modules before installation.
        * Implement security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in modules and themes.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Drupal's Render Array System](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_drupal's_render_array_system.md)

* **Description:** Insecurely constructed render arrays, a core concept in Drupal for building output, can lead to vulnerabilities.
    * **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal's flexible render array system, if not used carefully, can be exploited to inject malicious code or disclose information.
    * **Example:** A developer incorrectly uses a render array to directly output user-supplied data without proper sanitization, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, information disclosure, and potentially remote code execution in specific scenarios.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always sanitize user input before including it in render arrays.
        * Be cautious when using render array properties like `#markup` and `#type`.
        * Follow Drupal's secure coding practices for render array construction.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_file_uploads.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Drupal's file upload mechanisms can allow attackers to upload malicious files.
    * **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal provides file upload functionality, and if not implemented securely, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image, and due to improper validation, the script is placed in a publicly accessible directory and can be executed, leading to remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, malware distribution, and data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension.
        * Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible.
        * Ensure proper permissions are set on uploaded files.
        * Consider using a dedicated file storage service.
        * Scan uploaded files for malware.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Contributed Modules or Custom Code (using Drupal's APIs Insecurely)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_contributed_modules_or_custom_code__using_drupal's_apis_insecurely_.md)

* **Description:** While Drupal core aims to prevent direct SQL injection, contributed modules or custom code might introduce this vulnerability by improperly using Drupal's database APIs.
    * **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal provides APIs for database interaction, and misuse can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in extending code.
    * **Example:** A contributed module constructs a database query by directly concatenating user input without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potential for complete database compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always use Drupal's database abstraction layer (e.g., `db_query()`, entity queries) with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
        * Thoroughly review and test custom and contributed code for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        * Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential SQL injection flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Contributed Modules or Custom Code (using Drupal's Rendering APIs Insecurely)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_contributed_modules_or_custom_code__using_drupal's_rendering_apis_93ea3203.md)

* **Description:**  Contributed modules or custom code might introduce XSS vulnerabilities by improperly handling user input when rendering output using Drupal's APIs.
    * **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal's rendering system, while providing tools for sanitization, requires developers to use them correctly.
    * **Example:** A contributed module displays user-submitted comments without properly escaping HTML characters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that executes in other users' browsers.
    * **Impact:** Account hijacking, session theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and information theft.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always sanitize user input before displaying it on the website.
        * Use Drupal's built-in sanitization functions (e.g., `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Xss::filterAdmin()`, `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Xss::filter()`).
        * Be mindful of the context in which data is being displayed and use appropriate sanitization methods.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
