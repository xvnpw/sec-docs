        1. **Search and Acquisition:** Attackers search for exploit code corresponding to the identified vulnerability and the specific version of the vulnerable module.
        2. **Adaptation and Testing:**  Exploit code might need minor adjustments to match the target environment. Attackers often test the exploit in a controlled environment before deploying it against the target.
        3. **Execution:** The attacker executes the exploit code against the target Drupal application. This could involve sending specially crafted HTTP requests, manipulating input parameters, or uploading malicious files.
    * **Challenges for Attackers:**
        * **Reliability of Exploit Code:** Publicly available exploit code might not always be reliable or work in all environments.
        * **Evasion of Security Measures:**  The exploit might need to bypass security measures like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

* **Exploit Vulnerability via Module's Functionality:**
    * **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities by interacting with the intended functionality of the vulnerable module in unintended and malicious ways. This often involves manipulating user input, exploiting logical flaws, or bypassing security checks within the module's code.
    * **Common Vulnerability Types in Modules:**
        * **SQL Injection:**  Manipulating input fields to inject malicious SQL queries into database interactions.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        * **Path Traversal:**  Bypassing security checks to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
        * **Insecure Deserialization:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how data is unserialized, potentially leading to RCE.
        * **Authentication and Authorization Flaws:**  Bypassing or escalating privileges due to weaknesses in authentication or authorization mechanisms.
        * **File Upload Vulnerabilities:**  Uploading malicious files that can be executed by the server.
    * **Attacker Methodology:**
        1. **Understanding Module Functionality:** Attackers analyze the module's code or documentation to understand its intended purpose and how it handles user input.
        2. **Identifying Attack Surfaces:** They identify areas where user input is processed, data is stored, or external resources are accessed.
        3. **Crafting Malicious Input:** Attackers craft specific input values designed to trigger the vulnerability. This might involve special characters, encoded data, or unexpected data types.
        4. **Executing the Attack:** The attacker interacts with the module's functionality, sending the crafted malicious input through web forms, API endpoints, or other interaction points.
    * **Challenges for Attackers:**
        * **Requires Deeper Understanding:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities through functionality often requires a more in-depth understanding of the module's code and logic compared to simply using existing exploit code.
        * **Evasion of Input Validation:**  Modules often implement input validation to prevent malicious input. Attackers need to find ways to bypass these checks.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

The consequences of successfully exploiting a contributed module vulnerability can be severe:
