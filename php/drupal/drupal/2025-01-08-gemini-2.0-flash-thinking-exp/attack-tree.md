## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Drupal Core Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_drupal_core_vulnerability.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Drupal Core Vulnerability**
    * **Attack Vectors (High-Risk Path: Exploit Known Drupal Core Vulnerability):**
        * **Identify Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability:** Attackers actively monitor Drupal security advisories and vulnerability databases for known weaknesses in the core software.
        * **Leverage Existing Exploit Code:** Publicly available exploit code simplifies the process of exploiting known vulnerabilities, requiring less skill from the attacker.
        * **Exploit Vulnerability via Network Access:** Attackers can often exploit these vulnerabilities remotely, without needing prior access to the system.
        * **Impact:** Successful exploitation of a core vulnerability can lead to complete application takeover, data breaches, and the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Contributed Module Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_contributed_module_vulnerability.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Contributed Module Vulnerability**
    * **Attack Vectors (High-Risk Path: Exploit Known Contributed Module Vulnerability):**
        * **Identify Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability in Installed Module:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in commonly used contributed modules, as these represent a large attack surface.
        * **Leverage Existing Exploit Code for the Module:** Similar to core vulnerabilities, exploits for popular module vulnerabilities are often publicly available.
        * **Exploit Vulnerability via Module's Functionality:** Attackers can use the intended functionality of a vulnerable module in unintended ways to compromise the application.
        * **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, and the ability to inject malicious content or code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Drupal API](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_drupal_api.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Unauthorized Access to API Endpoints due to Misconfiguration**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Lack of Authentication:** API endpoints may not require authentication, allowing anyone to access them.
        * **Weak or Default Credentials:** API keys or authentication tokens might be default or easily guessable.
        * **Insufficient Authorization:** Users might have access to API endpoints they shouldn't, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions.
        * **Impact:** Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, manipulation of data through the API, and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Drupal's Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_drupal's_configuration_weaknesses.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Drupal's Configuration Weaknesses**
    * **Attack Vectors (High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure File Permissions):**
        * **Access Sensitive Configuration Files (e.g., settings.php):** Incorrect file permissions allow attackers to read sensitive files containing database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
        * **Impact:** Access to `settings.php` often grants full database access and the ability to reconfigure the application.

    * **Attack Vectors (High-Risk Path: Exploit Default or Weak Administrative Credentials):**
        * **Default Credentials:** Attackers may attempt to log in using default usernames and passwords that were not changed during installation.
        * **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can use automated tools to try numerous password combinations to guess administrative credentials.
        * **Credential Stuffing:** If users reuse passwords across multiple sites, attackers can use credentials leaked from other breaches to access the Drupal admin panel.
        * **Impact:** Gaining administrative access provides complete control over the Drupal application, allowing attackers to modify content, users, install malicious modules, and potentially gain access to the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Configuration Files (e.g., settings.php)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_configuration_files__e_g___settings_php_.md)

* **Critical Node: Access Sensitive Configuration Files (e.g., settings.php)**
    * **Attack Vectors:** As described under "Exploit Insecure File Permissions."
    * **Impact:** Direct access to critical configuration details, most notably database credentials, leading to potential data breaches and full application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Access to the Drupal Backend](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_access_to_the_drupal_backend.md)

* **Critical Node: Gain Administrative Access to the Drupal Backend**
    * **Attack Vectors:** As described under "Exploit Default or Weak Administrative Credentials," but also can be the result of other successful exploits.
    * **Impact:** Full control over the Drupal application, enabling attackers to perform any action a legitimate administrator can.
