# Threat Model Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Threat: [Publicly Disclosed Drupal Core Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/publicly_disclosed_drupal_core_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Publicly Disclosed Drupal Core Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a publicly disclosed security vulnerability in Drupal core (e.g., through security advisories on drupal.org) and crafts an exploit to leverage this flaw. They might send specially crafted requests to the application to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control; data breaches by accessing sensitive information stored in the database; or denial of service by crashing the application.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Specific subsystems within Drupal core, such as the Form API, Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL), or rendering engine. The exact component varies depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply security updates for Drupal core promptly after release.
        *   Subscribe to Drupal security advisories to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a robust patch management process.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Drupal Core](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_drupal_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization in Drupal Core
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Drupal core handles serialized PHP objects. They craft malicious serialized data that, when unserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code on the server. This often involves manipulating session data or other inputs that are deserialized by Drupal core.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** PHP's `unserialize()` function used within Drupal core when processing potentially untrusted data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Drupal core is updated to versions that address known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data within Drupal core's processes.
        *   Implement integrity checks for serialized data handled by Drupal core.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Drupal Core's Rendering Pipeline](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_drupal_core's_rendering_pipeline.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Drupal Core's Rendering Pipeline
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the website through vulnerabilities in how Drupal core renders user-supplied content. This could involve exploiting insufficient sanitization of input fields or other user-generated data processed directly by Drupal core's rendering mechanisms. When other users view the affected page, the malicious script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Stealing user session cookies (leading to account takeover), redirecting users to malicious websites, defacing the website, or performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Drupal's rendering engine (including Twig templates within core), Form API when handling user input within core forms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Drupal's built-in XSS filtering mechanisms (e.g., using the `|escape` filter in Twig templates within core).
        *   Ensure proper input validation and sanitization when developing custom code interacting with Drupal core's rendering.

## Threat: [Access Control Bypass due to Vulnerabilities in Drupal Core's Permission Handling](./threats/access_control_bypass_due_to_vulnerabilities_in_drupal_core's_permission_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Access Control Bypass due to Vulnerabilities in Drupal Core's Permission Handling
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Drupal core handles access checks. This allows them to access content or functionality that they are not authorized to use, potentially gaining administrative privileges or accessing sensitive data managed by Drupal core.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to content and features, privilege escalation, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Drupal's User and Permissions system within core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure user roles and permissions, following the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly review and audit user permissions within the Drupal core interface.
        *   Ensure custom code respects Drupal core's permission system.
