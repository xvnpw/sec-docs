# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Drupal Core and Contributed Modules Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_drupal_core_and_contributed_modules_up-to-date.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Regularly update Drupal core and contributed modules to the latest security releases.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Patching Schedule:** Define a regular schedule (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) to check for and apply security updates released by the Drupal Security Team.
    2.  **Subscribe to Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Drupal Security Team's mailing list or RSS feed on Drupal.org to receive immediate notifications of security releases.
    3.  **Test Updates in a Staging Environment:** Before applying updates to the production environment, apply them to a staging environment that mirrors production. Thoroughly test Drupal functionality for any regressions or conflicts.
    4.  **Use Drupal Update Tools:** Utilize tools specifically designed for Drupal updates like Drush (`drush updb`, `drush pm-update`) or Drupal Console (`drupal update:entities`, `drupal update:code`) or Composer (`composer update`) which are Drupal-aware.
    5.  **Apply Updates to Production:** After successful testing in staging, apply the updates to the production Drupal environment during a scheduled maintenance window.
    6.  **Verify Drupal Update Success:** After applying updates, verify within Drupal's admin interface (or via Drush/Console) that the Drupal version and module versions are correctly updated and that the site is functioning as expected.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Drupal Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Exploits of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Drupal core and modules. These are Drupal-specific vulnerabilities that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other critical security breaches within the Drupal application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Drupal Vulnerabilities (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known Drupal vulnerabilities. Applying Drupal security patches promptly is the most effective way to mitigate these Drupal-specific threats.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:**  A monthly update schedule is in place, and the team uses Drush for updates. Drupal Security advisories are monitored, but staging environment testing is sometimes skipped for minor updates due to time constraints.
    *   **Location:** Update process documented in the team's DevOps procedures.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Staging Environment Testing for all Drupal Updates:**  Consistent testing in a staging environment before production deployment for *all* Drupal updates, regardless of perceived severity.
    *   **Automated Drupal Update Notifications:** Implement automated alerts from Drupal security feeds directly into the team's communication channels (e.g., Slack, email).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit Installed Modules within Drupal](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_installed_modules_within_drupal.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Periodically review and remove unnecessary or outdated Drupal modules *within the Drupal admin interface*.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Module Inventory via Drupal Admin:** Access the Drupal administration interface (`/admin/modules`) to view a list of all enabled and installed Drupal modules.
    2.  **Functionality Review within Drupal Context:** For each module, review its description and understand its purpose within the Drupal site's functionality. Determine if it is still actively used and necessary for the Drupal application's features.
    3.  **Maintenance Status Check on Drupal.org:** For each module, link to its Drupal.org project page to verify its maintenance status. Check for:
        *   Active development and recent Drupal releases.
        *   Security advisories history specifically related to the Drupal module.
        *   Number of reported issues and their resolution rate within the Drupal community.
    4.  **Disable Unnecessary Drupal Modules:** Disable Drupal modules that are no longer required or whose Drupal functionality is redundant through the Drupal admin interface.
    5.  **Uninstall Outdated/Unmaintained Drupal Modules:** Uninstall Drupal modules that are outdated, unmaintained, or have a poor security track record within the Drupal ecosystem, especially if they are not actively used in the Drupal site. Consider replacing Drupal module functionality with more secure or actively maintained Drupal alternatives if needed.
    6.  **Document Drupal Module Rationale:** Document within Drupal's configuration or externally the reason for keeping each enabled Drupal module to facilitate future audits and onboarding of new team members familiar with Drupal.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Unused Drupal Modules (Medium Severity):**  Even disabled Drupal modules can sometimes contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited if re-enabled or if Drupal configuration files are compromised. These are Drupal module specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Increased Drupal Attack Surface (Medium Severity):**  More Drupal modules mean more Drupal code, increasing the potential Drupal attack surface and complexity of Drupal security management.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Unused Drupal Modules (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk by removing potential Drupal attack vectors from unused Drupal code.
    *   **Increased Drupal Attack Surface (Medium Impact):** Simplifies Drupal security management and reduces the overall Drupal codebase to maintain.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Drupal module audits are conducted annually as part of a general security review, focusing on the Drupal module list in the admin interface.
    *   **Location:**  Drupal module inventory is maintained in a spreadsheet.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **More Frequent Drupal Audits:** Conduct Drupal module audits more frequently, ideally quarterly or bi-annually, specifically reviewing the Drupal module list.
    *   **Automated Drupal Module Inventory:** Implement a tool or script (potentially using Drush or Drupal Console) to automatically generate a Drupal module inventory report for easier auditing within the Drupal context.
    *   **Formal Drupal Module Removal Process:** Establish a formal process for disabling and uninstalling Drupal modules, including documentation and testing within the Drupal environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Drupal's Security Features](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_drupal's_security_features.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Leverage Drupal's built-in security features and APIs for secure development.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Form API for CSRF Protection:**  When developing custom Drupal modules or forms, *always* use Drupal's Form API. It provides automatic CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, a Drupal core security feature.
    2.  **Database Abstraction Layer for SQL Injection Prevention:**  *Never* write direct SQL queries in Drupal.  Utilize Drupal's Database API (e.g., `\Drupal::database()`, Entity Query) for all database interactions. This API provides parameterized queries and input sanitization, preventing SQL Injection vulnerabilities within Drupal.
    3.  **Output Escaping for XSS Prevention:** When displaying user-generated content or any dynamic data in Drupal, use Drupal's rendering system and theming functions (e.g., Twig's `escape` filter, `\Drupal\Component\Utility\Html::escape()`). These mechanisms automatically escape output, mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Drupal templates and code.
    4.  **Drupal Permissions System:**  Utilize Drupal's robust permissions system to control access to content and administrative functions. Define granular roles and permissions to enforce the principle of least privilege within the Drupal application. Configure these permissions through the Drupal admin interface (`/admin/people/permissions`).
    5.  **Drupal Security Settings Review:** Regularly review Drupal's security-related configuration settings in `settings.php` and through the Drupal admin interface (if available via modules). Ensure settings like error reporting are appropriately configured for production environments to prevent information disclosure from Drupal.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity):**  Exploitation of Drupal forms without CSRF protection.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities arising from direct SQL queries in Drupal code.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  Vulnerabilities due to improper output handling in Drupal templates and code.
    *   **Authorization Bypass (Medium to High Severity):**  Incorrectly configured Drupal permissions leading to unauthorized access to Drupal functionalities and data.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):**  Verbose Drupal error reporting in production environments revealing sensitive information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF (Medium Impact):** Prevents attackers from performing actions on behalf of authenticated Drupal users.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Impact):**  Eliminates a critical vulnerability that could lead to complete database compromise in Drupal.
    *   **XSS (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks within the Drupal application.
    *   **Authorization Bypass (Medium to High Impact):** Enforces access control and protects sensitive Drupal functionalities and data.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Impact):** Prevents leakage of potentially sensitive information through Drupal error messages.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Largely Implemented:** The development team generally uses Drupal's Form API, Database API, and output escaping mechanisms. Drupal's permission system is used for access control.
    *   **Location:**  Coding standards documentation, Drupal module development guidelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Code Reviews focused on Drupal Security APIs:** Implement mandatory code reviews specifically focused on verifying the correct usage of Drupal's security-related APIs (Form API, Database API, output escaping) in all custom Drupal code and module contributions.
    *   **Automated Static Analysis for Drupal Security API Usage:** Explore and integrate static analysis tools that can automatically check for correct usage of Drupal's security APIs in custom code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden Drupal Configuration Settings](./mitigation_strategies/harden_drupal_configuration_settings.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Review and adjust Drupal's configuration settings to enhance security.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Error Reporting in Drupal Production:** In Drupal's `settings.php` file, ensure error reporting is disabled for production environments (`error_level: error_level: 'hide'`). This prevents sensitive information from being displayed in error messages to public users of the Drupal site.
    2.  **Configure Drupal Caching:** Properly configure Drupal's caching mechanisms (e.g., page cache, block cache, internal dynamic page cache) through the Drupal admin interface (`/admin/config/development/performance`) or `settings.php`. Caching can help mitigate denial-of-service attacks by reducing server load.
    3.  **Set Secure Cookie Flags in Drupal:** Configure Drupal's cookie settings in `settings.php` to include `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. `HttpOnly` prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing cookies, mitigating XSS-based cookie theft. `Secure` ensures cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
    4.  **Review Drupal User Registration and Password Policies:** Review and adjust Drupal's user registration settings (`/admin/config/people/accounts`) and password policies (`/admin/config/security/password-policy` - if using a module) within the Drupal admin interface. Enforce strong password policies and consider disabling open registration if not needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):** Drupal error messages revealing sensitive information in production.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Lack of Drupal caching making the site vulnerable to DoS attacks.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) based Cookie Theft (Medium Severity):**  Cookies without `HttpOnly` flag vulnerable to theft via XSS.
    *   **Session Hijacking (Medium Severity):** Cookies without `Secure` flag vulnerable to interception over non-HTTPS connections.
    *   **Weak Passwords (Medium Severity):**  Lack of strong password policies leading to easily guessable user passwords in Drupal.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Impact):** Prevents leakage of potentially sensitive information through Drupal error messages.
    *   **DoS (Medium Impact):** Improves site resilience against DoS attacks by reducing server load.
    *   **XSS Cookie Theft (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of cookie theft via XSS attacks.
    *   **Session Hijacking (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of session hijacking by ensuring secure cookie transmission.
    *   **Weak Passwords (Medium Impact):**  Encourages or enforces stronger passwords, making user accounts more secure within Drupal.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Error reporting is disabled in production. Basic Drupal caching is configured. Cookie flags and password policies are not explicitly configured beyond default Drupal settings.
    *   **Location:** `settings.php` configuration, Drupal performance settings in admin interface.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Explicitly Configure Secure Cookie Flags in Drupal:**  Add explicit configuration for `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookie flags in Drupal's `settings.php`.
    *   **Implement Strong Drupal Password Policies:**  Implement and enforce strong password policies using Drupal's built-in features or password policy modules.
    *   **Regular Review of Drupal Security Settings:**  Establish a schedule for regular review of Drupal's security-related configuration settings to ensure they remain appropriately hardened.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Properly Utilize Drupal's APIs for Input Validation and Output Escaping](./mitigation_strategies/properly_utilize_drupal's_apis_for_input_validation_and_output_escaping.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Strictly adhere to Drupal's APIs for handling user input and output in custom Drupal code and modules.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Form API for Input Validation:**  *Always* use Drupal's Form API for form handling. The Form API provides built-in validation mechanisms. Define validation callbacks in your Drupal forms to validate user input on the server-side before processing or storing it.
    2.  **Rendering System and Theming for Output Escaping:**  *Always* use Drupal's rendering system (Render Arrays) and theming functions (Twig templates, theme functions) for outputting data to the browser. These systems automatically apply context-aware output escaping, preventing XSS vulnerabilities in Drupal. Avoid manually concatenating strings for output in Drupal templates or code.
    3.  **Database API for Parameterized Queries:**  *Exclusively* use Drupal's Database API for all database interactions. Utilize parameterized queries (placeholders) when constructing database queries with user-provided input. This prevents SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Drupal database interactions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  Vulnerabilities due to improper output handling in custom Drupal code and modules.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities arising from insecure database queries in custom Drupal code and modules.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):**  Lack of input validation leading to invalid or malicious data being stored in Drupal.
