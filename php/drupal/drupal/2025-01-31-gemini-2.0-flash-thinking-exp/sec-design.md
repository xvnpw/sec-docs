# BUSINESS POSTURE

Drupal is a powerful open-source content management system (CMS) that enables organizations to build and manage websites and digital experiences. The primary business goal for adopting Drupal is to create, manage, and deliver content effectively to various audiences, supporting business objectives such as marketing, communication, e-commerce, and community engagement.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Content Creation and Management: Empower content creators to easily publish and update website content.
- Digital Experience Delivery: Provide engaging and personalized digital experiences to users across different channels and devices.
- Scalability and Performance: Ensure the website can handle increasing traffic and content volume while maintaining optimal performance.
- Extensibility and Flexibility: Offer a platform that can be customized and extended to meet evolving business needs through modules and integrations.
- Community and Ecosystem: Leverage a large and active open-source community for support, innovation, and security updates.

Business Risks:
- Data Breach and Data Loss: Sensitive content and user data could be compromised, leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.
- Website Defacement and Malware Injection: Unauthorized modification of the website or injection of malicious code can damage brand reputation and user trust.
- Service Disruption and Downtime: Website unavailability can lead to loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction, and missed business opportunities.
- Complexity and Maintenance Overhead: Managing a complex CMS like Drupal can require specialized skills and resources, potentially increasing operational costs.
- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Security vulnerabilities in contributed modules or third-party integrations can introduce risks to the Drupal platform.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Drupal core and contributed modules undergo community security reviews and are regularly updated to address vulnerabilities. (Source: Drupal Security Team and release notes)
- security control: Drupal provides a robust permission system for managing user access and roles. (Source: Drupal documentation)
- security control: Drupal supports secure password hashing and storage. (Source: Drupal core code)
- security control: Drupal core includes protection against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. (Source: Drupal security documentation and code)
- security control: Drupal community provides security advisories and best practices documentation. (Source: Drupal.org/security)
- security control: Hosting providers often offer infrastructure-level security controls such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. (Source: General cloud hosting practices)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community-driven security updates may introduce a delay in patching newly discovered vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Security of contributed modules depends on the module maintainers and may vary in quality and security rigor.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of Drupal or its modules can introduce security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Third-party integrations may introduce security risks if not properly vetted and maintained.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
- security control: Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for security monitoring and incident response.

Build Process Description:
The build process for Drupal typically involves the following steps, focusing on security and automation:

1. Developer Code Commit: Developers commit code changes to a Version Control System (VCS) like Git hosted on GitHub.
2. CI/CD Trigger: A webhook in the VCS triggers the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) upon code changes.
3. Build Environment Setup: The CI/CD system sets up a clean and isolated build environment.
4. Security Checks:
    - SAST Scanner: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Code Linter: Code linters are used to enforce code quality and coding standards, which can indirectly improve security.
5. Automated Testing: Unit and integration tests are executed to ensure code functionality and prevent regressions.
6. Package Building: The build environment packages the Drupal application and its dependencies into deployable artifacts (e.g., tar.gz, Docker image).
7. Artifact Repository: The build artifacts are stored in a secure artifact repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory, cloud storage).
8. Deployment: The artifacts from the repository are deployed to the target deployment environment (e.g., staging, production).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Content Publishing and Management: The ability to create, update, and publish content is critical for maintaining website freshness and relevance. Disruption to this process can impact marketing campaigns, communication efforts, and overall website effectiveness.
- Website Availability: Website uptime is crucial for user access and business operations. Downtime can lead to loss of revenue, customer dissatisfaction, and reputational damage.
- User Account Management: Secure management of user accounts, especially administrative accounts, is essential to prevent unauthorized access and maintain website integrity.
- Data Collection and Processing (if applicable): If the Drupal website collects user data (e.g., through forms, e-commerce transactions), the secure processing and storage of this data are critical for compliance and user trust.

Data Sensitivity:
- Content Data: Website content itself may vary in sensitivity. Public-facing content is generally low sensitivity, while internal documentation or proprietary information would be considered more sensitive.
- User Data: User accounts, personal information collected through forms, and potentially e-commerce transaction data are considered sensitive data. The sensitivity level depends on the type of data collected and applicable privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Configuration Data: Drupal configuration data, including database credentials, API keys, and server settings, is highly sensitive. Compromise of this data can lead to full system compromise.
- Log Data: Logs may contain sensitive information and are important for security monitoring and incident response. Log data sensitivity depends on the level of detail and type of information logged.
