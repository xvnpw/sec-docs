## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Contributed Modules/Themes Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Vulnerability in Module/Theme -> SQL Injection (Common in poorly written modules)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_contributed_modulesthemes_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_vulnerability_in_moduletheme_-_sql_injec_fada7cc7.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within contributed Drupal modules and themes, which are often less rigorously reviewed than Drupal core. SQL Injection is a prevalent vulnerability in these components due to:
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Modules may fail to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries.
    *   **Direct Database Queries:** Modules might bypass Drupal's database abstraction layer and execute direct SQL queries, increasing the risk of injection if not handled carefully.
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields or URL parameters processed by vulnerable modules. This injected code is then executed by the database, allowing attackers to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Extract sensitive data from the Drupal database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Administrative Access:** Potentially gain administrative privileges by manipulating user roles or creating new admin accounts.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Contributed modules are a large and diverse attack surface. SQL Injection is a well-understood and easily exploitable vulnerability. Many modules are developed by third parties with varying security expertise, increasing the likelihood of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Drupal Update/Patching Negligence -> Identify Outdated Drupal Installation -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Version -> Utilize Publicly Available Exploits](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_drupal_updatepatching_negligence_-_identify_outdated_drupal_installation_-_exploit_known_vul_bab2ecd5.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the failure to keep Drupal core and contributed modules/themes updated with security patches.
    *   **Version Enumeration:** Attackers first identify the Drupal version (and potentially module/theme versions) using various techniques like checking changelog files, HTTP headers, or using version scanners.
    *   **Public Exploit Databases:** Once an outdated version is identified, attackers search public vulnerability databases (like Drupal Security Advisories, Exploit-DB, Metasploit) for known exploits targeting that specific version.
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers utilize readily available exploits (often pre-built scripts or Metasploit modules) to target known vulnerabilities in the outdated Drupal installation. These exploits can lead to:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting known SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Other Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting various other vulnerabilities depending on the specific outdated version.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Outdated software is a primary target for attackers. Publicly available exploits significantly lower the barrier to entry, making it easy for even less skilled attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities.  Many organizations fail to apply security updates promptly, leaving them vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Drupal Configuration/Misconfiguration -> Publicly Accessible Administrative Interfaces -> Brute-Force Attacks on Admin/User Logins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_drupal_configurationmisconfiguration_-_publicly_accessible_administrative_interfaces_-_brute_c6bd3b31.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations related to administrative access and weak credentials.
    *   **Public Admin Interfaces:** Leaving administrative login pages (like `/user`, `/admin`) publicly accessible allows anyone to attempt login.
    *   **Weak Passwords:**  Using weak, default, or easily guessable passwords for administrative accounts makes brute-force attacks feasible.
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers use automated tools to perform brute-force attacks against the administrative login pages, attempting to guess valid usernames and passwords. Successful brute-force attacks grant attackers:
    *   **Administrative Access:** Full control over the Drupal application, allowing them to modify content, install modules, access data, and potentially gain control of the underlying server.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Publicly accessible admin interfaces are a common misconfiguration. Weak passwords are still prevalent. Brute-force attacks are relatively simple to execute and can be automated, making this a readily available attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Drupal API/Service Weaknesses -> Exploit API/Service Vulnerability -> Authentication Bypass in API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_drupal_apiservice_weaknesses_-_exploit_apiservice_vulnerability_-_authentication_bypass_in_a_10b3e185.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in Drupal's APIs (RESTful, GraphQL, etc.) or web services modules, specifically focusing on authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   **Authentication Flaws:** APIs may have flaws in their authentication mechanisms, allowing attackers to bypass login requirements and access API endpoints without proper credentials. This could be due to insecure coding practices in API implementation or misconfiguration of authentication settings.
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers exploit authentication bypass vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to API endpoints. This allows them to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Access sensitive data exposed through the API.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data via API endpoints.
    *   **Functionality Abuse:** Utilize API functionalities for malicious purposes.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  APIs are increasingly common in modern Drupal applications. Authentication bypass vulnerabilities in APIs can have a significant impact, potentially exposing large amounts of data or critical functionalities.  API security is often overlooked or not implemented as robustly as web application security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Drupal Core Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Vulnerability -> Remote Code Execution (RCE) / SQL Injection (Drupal specific vectors)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_drupal_core_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_vulnerability_-_remote_code_execution__rce___sql_injec_5af95bd4.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities directly within Drupal core code. While less frequent than in contributed modules, core vulnerabilities can have a wide-reaching impact. RCE and SQL Injection are particularly critical vulnerability types.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. In Drupal core, these might arise from:
        *   Unserialize vulnerabilities (historically in older versions).
        *   Less common, but potential, code injection flaws.
    *   **SQL Injection (Drupal specific vectors):** Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. In Drupal core, these might involve:
        *   Weaknesses in the database abstraction layer (less likely but possible).
        *   Vulnerabilities in core modules like Views or form handling.
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers exploit RCE vulnerabilities to gain full control of the server. SQL Injection vulnerabilities allow for database manipulation and potential data breaches.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Core vulnerabilities, especially RCE and SQL Injection, are extremely critical due to their potential for complete system compromise and data breaches. While Drupal core is generally well-secured, when vulnerabilities are found, they are often highly impactful and widely targeted.
