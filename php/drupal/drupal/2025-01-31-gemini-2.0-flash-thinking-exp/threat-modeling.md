# Threat Model Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Threat: [Exploitation of Drupal Core Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_drupal_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Drupal Core Vulnerability Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a publicly known or zero-day vulnerability in Drupal core code. This could involve sending crafted requests to trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data access, or complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), data breaches, website defacement, complete system compromise.
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Core (various subsystems depending on the vulnerability, e.g., database abstraction layer, routing, form API, etc.)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Timely Patching:** Apply security updates released by the Drupal Security Team *immediately* after release. This is the most critical mitigation.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Subscribe to Drupal security advisories and configure alerts for new security releases to ensure rapid patching.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to provide an additional layer of defense and potentially block exploit attempts before patches are applied, especially for zero-day vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Contributed Module Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_contributed_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Contributed Module Vulnerability Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a contributed Drupal module. This could be due to insecure coding practices, lack of maintenance, or undiscovered vulnerabilities. Attackers may target popular modules or modules specific to the application to gain control.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), data breaches, website defacement, access bypass, complete system compromise.
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Contributed Modules (specific module code and functionality)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if RCE or direct data breach is possible, High for other significant impacts like SQLi or access bypass leading to sensitive data)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Module Selection & Vetting:**  Prioritize using well-established, actively maintained, and security-reviewed contributed modules. Check Drupal.org security advisories and module issue queues *before* installation.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep *all* contributed modules updated to the latest versions, applying security patches *immediately*. Automate this process where possible.
    *   **Security Reviews (of critical modules):** For modules handling sensitive data or core functionality, consider security reviews or penetration testing, especially if they are less common or have a history of vulnerabilities.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle for Modules:** Grant modules only the *minimum* necessary permissions to limit the potential damage if a module is compromised.

## Threat: [Insecure Drupal Configuration leading to Privilege Escalation or Takeover](./threats/insecure_drupal_configuration_leading_to_privilege_escalation_or_takeover.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Drupal Configuration - Privilege Escalation/Takeover
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits critical misconfigurations in Drupal settings to gain administrative privileges or take complete control of the website. This includes leaving default administrator credentials unchanged, exposing administrative paths without proper protection, or granting overly permissive roles to anonymous or untrusted users.
*   **Impact:** Privilege Escalation, Website Takeover, Complete System Compromise, Data Breach, Website Defacement.
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Configuration (settings.php, permissions system, user roles, administrative interface settings)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Installation & Hardening:** Follow Drupal security best practices *rigorously* during installation and hardening. This includes *immediately* changing default administrator credentials to strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Restrict Administrative Access:**  Implement strict access controls to administrative paths and functions. Use IP whitelisting or VPNs to limit access to administrative interfaces.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Roles:**  Design and configure user roles and permissions with the *principle of least privilege*. Regularly audit and refine roles to ensure they are not overly permissive.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of Drupal configuration settings, specifically focusing on user roles, permissions, and administrative access controls.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Outdated Drupal Core and Modules](./threats/exploitation_of_outdated_drupal_core_and_modules.md)

*   **Threat:** Outdated Drupal Components Exploitation
*   **Description:** Attackers target *known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities* in outdated versions of Drupal core or contributed modules. Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often readily available and easily automated, making outdated systems highly vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), data breaches, website defacement, complete system compromise.
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Core and Contributed Modules (outdated versions)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive and Automated Patching:** Implement a *fully automated* patching process for Drupal core and modules. Aim for near-instantaneous patching upon security release.
    *   **Version Control and Staging Environment:** Use version control to manage Drupal codebase and *mandatory* testing of updates in a staging environment *before* deploying to production. However, for security patches, the priority is speed, so a streamlined testing process focused on stability and not delaying security updates is crucial.
    *   **Continuous Monitoring for Outdated Components:** Implement continuous monitoring to detect outdated Drupal core and module versions and trigger immediate update processes.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Insecure Custom Code (Themes and Modules)](./threats/exploitation_of_insecure_custom_code__themes_and_modules_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Custom Code Vulnerability Exploitation
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit *critical vulnerabilities* (like RCE, SQLi) introduced in custom Drupal themes or modules. These vulnerabilities are often due to lack of security expertise during development and insufficient security testing.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, data breaches, complete system compromise, privilege escalation.
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Custom Themes and Modules (specific code developed for the application)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (Critical if RCE or direct data breach is possible, High for SQLi or significant access bypass)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Secure Coding Practices:** Enforce *strict* secure coding guidelines for *all* custom Drupal development. Focus on preventing common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and insecure file handling.
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews by Security-Conscious Developers:** Implement *mandatory* code reviews for *all* custom code by developers with security expertise.
    *   **Mandatory Security Testing (including Penetration Testing):** Perform *mandatory* security testing, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing, on *all* custom code *before* deployment to production.
    *   **Security Training for Developers:** Provide *regular and comprehensive* security training to developers on secure Drupal development practices and common Drupal-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Focused Development Lifecycle:** Integrate security into *every stage* of the development lifecycle for custom code, from design to deployment and maintenance.

## Threat: [Drupal Specific Access Control Bypass leading to Administrative Access or Sensitive Data Access](./threats/drupal_specific_access_control_bypass_leading_to_administrative_access_or_sensitive_data_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Drupal Access Control Bypass - Administrative/Sensitive Data Access
*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses Drupal's access control mechanisms to gain *administrative privileges* or access *sensitive data* they are not authorized to view or modify. This could be due to vulnerabilities in the permission system or flaws in custom access control implementations that grant excessive access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Administrative Access, Sensitive Data Breach, Privilege Escalation, Website Takeover.
*   **Drupal Component Affected:** Drupal Access Control System (permissions system, user roles, access checking functions)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if administrative access is gained or a large-scale sensitive data breach is possible, High for access to moderately sensitive data or privilege escalation within user roles)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Access Control Testing:** Thoroughly test access control mechanisms to ensure they *effectively* prevent unauthorized access, especially to administrative functions and sensitive data. Include both automated and manual testing.
    *   **Regular Permission Audits and Reviews:** Conduct *frequent* audits of Drupal permissions and user roles to identify and correct any misconfigurations or overly permissive settings that could lead to bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Custom Access Control Logic (if necessary):** If custom access control logic is implemented, ensure it is developed with *extreme care* and undergoes *extensive security review and testing*. Avoid complex custom access control logic if possible, relying on Drupal's built-in system.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege Enforcement:**  *Strictly enforce* the principle of least privilege in all aspects of Drupal access control configuration and custom code.
