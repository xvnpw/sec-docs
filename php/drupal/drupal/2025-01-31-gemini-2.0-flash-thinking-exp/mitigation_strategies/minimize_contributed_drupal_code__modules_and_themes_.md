#### 4.2. Threat Mitigation Assessment:

*   **Increased Drupal Attack Surface (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**.  Minimizing contributed code directly reduces the number of potential entry points for attackers. Each module introduces new code, potentially with vulnerabilities. This strategy directly addresses this threat by limiting the amount of external code.
    *   **Justification:** Fewer modules mean less code to analyze for vulnerabilities, fewer dependencies to manage, and a smaller overall attack surface.

*   **Vulnerabilities in Less Maintained Drupal Modules (Medium to High Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **High**.  Prioritizing well-maintained modules and minimizing reliance on contributed code significantly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.  Focusing on reputable modules and core features shifts the risk towards more actively managed and scrutinized codebases.
    *   **Justification:** Less maintained modules are more likely to contain undiscovered vulnerabilities and less likely to receive timely security updates. This strategy directly reduces exposure to such modules.

*   **Drupal Performance Issues (Low to Medium Severity):**
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:** **Medium to High**.  Reducing the number of modules can improve performance by reducing overhead, database queries, and code execution. While not the sole factor in performance, excessive modules can contribute significantly to slowdowns.
    *   **Justification:** Each module adds to the processing load of a Drupal site. Fewer modules generally lead to faster page load times and improved overall performance. The impact can be significant, especially for sites with numerous modules.

#### 4.3. Impact Analysis:

*   **Increased Drupal Attack Surface:** **Medium Reduction** -  While the reduction is significant, it's categorized as "Medium" because other factors also contribute to the attack surface (e.g., server configuration, network security, user permissions). However, within the Drupal application itself, this strategy provides a substantial reduction.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Less Maintained Drupal Modules:** **Medium to High Reduction** -  The reduction is potentially "High" because it directly targets a significant source of vulnerabilities. However, it's also "Medium" because even well-maintained modules can have vulnerabilities, and custom code can also introduce risks. The effectiveness depends heavily on the rigor of the implementation.
*   **Drupal Performance Issues:** **Low to Medium Reduction** -  The reduction is "Low to Medium" because performance is influenced by many factors beyond the number of modules (e.g., database optimization, caching, server resources).  While reducing modules helps, it's often part of a broader performance optimization strategy.

#### 4.4. Currently Implemented: Partially Implemented

*   **Analysis:**  The "Partially Implemented" status indicates a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  Attempting to use core features first is a positive practice. Reviewing module descriptions is a basic step, but lacks depth.  The absence of systematic reputation checks is a significant gap.
*   **Strengths of Current Implementation:**
    *   Awareness of core feature prioritization.
    *   Basic module description review.
*   **Weaknesses of Current Implementation:**
    *   Lack of formal extension selection process.
    *   Inconsistent or absent Drupal.org reputation checks.
    *   No regular extension audit policy.

#### 4.5. Missing Implementation and Recommendations:

*   **Formal Drupal Extension Selection Process:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a documented process for requesting, evaluating, and approving new contributed modules and themes. This process should involve:
        *   **Needs Justification:**  Require a clear justification for the functionality the extension provides and why core features are insufficient.
        *   **Functionality Review:**  Documented review of the extension's features and overlap with existing functionality.
        *   **Security Review:**  Mandatory Drupal.org reputation and maintenance checks (see below).
        *   **Performance Considerations:**  Assess potential performance impact of the extension.
        *   **Approval Workflow:**  Establish a clear approval workflow involving security and development leads.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Define the roles and responsibilities within the approval process.
        2.  Create a template or checklist for module/theme evaluation.
        3.  Document the approval workflow and communication channels.
        4.  Train development team on the new process.

*   **Mandatory Drupal.org Checks:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Make Drupal.org reputation and maintenance checks a mandatory step before installing *any* new contributed code.  Integrate this into the formal selection process.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Develop a checklist of Drupal.org metrics to evaluate (usage, releases, issues, security advisories, maintainer reputation).
        2.  Create a tool or script to automate some aspects of Drupal.org checks (if feasible).
        3.  Document the Drupal.org check process and required evidence.
        4.  Enforce the mandatory check through code review or automated checks in the development pipeline.

*   **Regular Drupal Extension Audit Policy:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Establish a formal policy for regular audits of installed modules and themes. Define the audit frequency, scope, criteria for removal, and responsible parties.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Define the audit frequency (e.g., quarterly).
        2.  Assign responsibility for conducting audits (e.g., security team, senior developers).
        3.  Develop an audit checklist or procedure.
        4.  Document the audit policy and communication plan for audit findings and actions.
        5.  Utilize Drupal tools or scripts to assist with identifying unused or outdated modules.

#### 4.6. Potential Drawbacks and Challenges:

*   **Reduced Feature Set:**  Strictly minimizing modules might limit access to readily available functionalities offered by contributed modules, potentially requiring more custom development effort.
*   **Increased Custom Development Burden:**  Over-reliance on custom development can increase development costs, time, and maintenance burden if not managed effectively.
*   **Developer Resistance:**  Developers might resist stricter module selection processes if it perceived as slowing down development or limiting their toolset.
*   **Balancing Security and Functionality:**  Finding the right balance between minimizing modules and providing necessary functionality requires careful judgment and ongoing evaluation.

#### 4.7. Overall Recommendation:

The "Minimize Contributed Drupal Code" mitigation strategy is a highly valuable and recommended approach for enhancing the security and performance of our Drupal application.
