# Attack Surface Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (SQLi)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__sqli_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, manipulating the database.
*   **Drupal Contribution:** Drupal's DBAL aims to prevent SQLi, but vulnerabilities can arise in core, contributed modules, or custom code if queries are improperly constructed, especially with user input.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable module concatenates unsanitized user input into a database query, allowing SQL injection via a form field.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, data loss, account takeover, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Drupal's DBAL API:** Employ prepared statements and query builders, avoiding direct string concatenation.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs before database use.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit custom and contributed code for SQLi vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users:** Limit database user privileges.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect SQLi attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Drupal Contribution:** Drupal's theming and content rendering can be vulnerable if user content is not properly sanitized. Contributed modules and custom code can also introduce XSS.
*   **Example:** A comment form lacks proper sanitization, allowing JavaScript injection in comments, executing in other users' browsers.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, website defacement, redirection, malware distribution, phishing.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (Stored XSS is High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode output when displaying user content, using Twig's auto-escaping correctly.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input server-side before database storage.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to control resource loading.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review themes and modules for XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use Drupal's Security APIs:** Utilize Drupal's built-in security functions.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers execute arbitrary code on the web server, leading to system compromise.
*   **Drupal Contribution:** Drupal core and modules can have vulnerabilities in file uploads, deserialization, or insecure function calls exploitable for RCE. Outdated versions are highly vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A module's file upload vulnerability allows uploading a malicious PHP script, enabling RCE by accessing the script directly.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, data manipulation, defacement, DoS, server misuse for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Drupal Core and Modules Up-to-Date:** Apply security updates immediately.
    *   **Disable Unused Modules:** Reduce attack surface by disabling unused modules.
    *   **Secure File Upload Handling:** Implement strict validation, restrict file types, store files outside webroot.
    *   **Code Reviews and Security Audits:** Audit custom and contributed code for RCE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** WAF can detect and block some RCE attempts.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Web Server User:** Run web server with minimal privileges.
    *   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Use scanners to identify known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Access Control Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/access_control_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass access controls to gain unauthorized access to data or functions.
*   **Drupal Contribution:** Drupal's permission system and node access logic can be misconfigured or contain vulnerabilities in core or modules, leading to bypasses.
*   **Example:** Misconfigured permissions grant anonymous users access to admin pages. A module vulnerability bypasses node access, allowing unauthorized content access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, website defacement, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (depending on exposed data/functions).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for User Roles and Permissions:** Grant minimal necessary access.
    *   **Regularly Review and Audit Permissions:** Ensure correct and policy-aligned permissions.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Access Control Logic:** Test custom module access control.
    *   **Use Drupal's Access Control APIs:** Utilize Drupal's built-in Permission and Node Access systems.
    *   **Security Audits:** Audit configurations and code for access control vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Contributed Modules and Themes](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_contributed_modules_and_themes.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in community-developed modules and themes.
*   **Drupal Contribution:** Drupal's ecosystem expands the attack surface with contributed components that may have vulnerabilities due to less scrutiny.
*   **Example:** A popular, unmaintained module contains an SQL injection or XSS vulnerability, targeted by attackers.
*   **Impact:** Varies (SQLi, XSS, RCE etc.), from information disclosure to system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Medium** (depending on vulnerability and module usage).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Choose Modules and Themes Carefully:** Select reputable, actively maintained components.
    *   **Regularly Update Modules and Themes:** Apply security patches promptly.
    *   **Security Reviews of Modules and Themes:** Review code or check for known vulnerabilities before use.
    *   **Use Drupal's Security Advisory System:** Monitor advisories for module/theme vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable Unused Modules and Themes:** Reduce attack surface.
    *   **Consider Security Audits for Critical Modules:** Audit critical or widely used modules.
