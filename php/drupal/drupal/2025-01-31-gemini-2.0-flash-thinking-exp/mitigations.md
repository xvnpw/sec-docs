    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Yes, Partially Implemented:** We have defined Drupal user roles, but a thorough review and enforcement of least privilege across all roles and permissions might be missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Drupal Permission Audit and Refinement:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of Drupal user roles and permissions and refine them to strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Drupal Least Privilege Policy:** Document and implement a formal Drupal least privilege policy for user roles and permissions.
        *   **Regular Drupal Permission Review Schedule:** Implement a schedule for regularly reviewing and auditing Drupal user roles and permissions to ensure ongoing adherence to least privilege.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit Drupal User Accounts and Roles](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_drupal_user_accounts_and_roles.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Drupal User Account Audit Schedule:** Define a regular schedule (e.g., quarterly or bi-annually) for auditing Drupal user accounts and roles.
    2.  **Identify Inactive Drupal User Accounts:** Identify Drupal user accounts that have been inactive for a defined period (e.g., 90 days) and investigate their necessity.
    3.  **Disable or Remove Inactive Drupal Accounts:** Disable or remove inactive Drupal user accounts that are no longer needed to reduce the attack surface.
    4.  **Review Drupal User Role Assignments:** Review Drupal user role assignments to ensure they are still appropriate and aligned with current user responsibilities.
    5.  **Document Drupal User Account Audit Process:** Document the Drupal user account audit process and maintain records of audits performed and actions taken.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromised Inactive Drupal Accounts (Medium to High Severity):** Inactive Drupal user accounts are often neglected and can become targets for attackers to compromise and use for malicious purposes.
        *   **Unauthorized Access via Stale Drupal Accounts (Medium to High Severity):** Stale Drupal user accounts belonging to former employees or users who no longer require access can be exploited for unauthorized access.
        *   **Increased Drupal User Management Overhead (Low Severity):** Maintaining a large number of unnecessary Drupal user accounts increases user management overhead.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromised Inactive Drupal Accounts:** **Medium to High Reduction** - Disabling or removing inactive Drupal accounts eliminates a potential attack vector through compromised stale accounts.
        *   **Unauthorized Access via Stale Drupal Accounts:** **Medium to High Reduction** - Removing stale Drupal accounts prevents unauthorized access by former users or through compromised stale accounts.
        *   **Increased Drupal User Management Overhead:** **Low Reduction** - Reducing the number of Drupal user accounts simplifies Drupal user management.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **No, Not Implemented:** Regular Drupal user account and role audits are currently not performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Drupal User Account Audit Script/Process:** Develop a script or process to automate the identification of inactive Drupal user accounts.
        *   **Drupal User Account Audit Schedule Implementation:** Implement the defined schedule for regular Drupal user account and role audits.
        *   **Drupal User Account Management Policy:** Document a Drupal user account management policy that includes account creation, deactivation, and auditing procedures.
