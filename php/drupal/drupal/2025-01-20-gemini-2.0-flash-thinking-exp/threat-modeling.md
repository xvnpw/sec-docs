# Threat Model Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Threat: [Exploitation of Drupal Core SQL Injection Vulnerability](./threats/exploitation_of_drupal_core_sql_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies a publicly disclosed SQL injection vulnerability in Drupal core (e.g., a flaw in a database abstraction layer function). They craft a malicious request with embedded SQL code, injecting it into a vulnerable input field or URL parameter. This allows them to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the database, including sensitive user data, configuration details, and potentially other application data. Could lead to data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and complete site takeover.
*   **Affected Component:** Drupal Core (specifically database abstraction layer, form API, or other input handling mechanisms).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply security updates for Drupal core as soon as they are released.
    *   Subscribe to Drupal security advisories to be notified of vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a regular update schedule and testing process for updates.
    *   Avoid modifying core Drupal files directly.

## Threat: [Access Bypass due to Insecure Permissions Configuration](./threats/access_bypass_due_to_insecure_permissions_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An administrator incorrectly configures Drupal's permission system, granting excessive privileges to anonymous or authenticated users. An attacker exploits this misconfiguration to access administrative functionalities, view sensitive content, or perform actions they are not authorized to perform.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of website content or settings, potential for privilege escalation, and overall compromise of the site's integrity.
*   **Affected Component:** Drupal Core (User module, Permission system).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.
    *   Understand the implications of each permission before granting it.
    *   Use Drupal's built-in permission system instead of implementing custom access control logic where possible.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Exposed Configuration Files](./threats/information_disclosure_via_exposed_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive configuration files (e.g., `settings.php`) due to misconfigured web server settings or vulnerabilities. These files may contain database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information that can be used to further compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to database compromise, access to external services, and potential for further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Drupal Core (configuration files).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure proper file permissions for configuration files, restricting access to the web server user only.
    *   Store sensitive credentials securely, potentially using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
    *   Configure the web server to prevent direct access to sensitive files.
    *   Regularly audit file permissions and web server configurations.

## Threat: [Account Takeover via Weak Password Recovery Mechanism](./threats/account_takeover_via_weak_password_recovery_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Drupal's password recovery process. This could involve predictable password reset links or insecure email verification. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to reset a user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential for data breaches, manipulation of user profiles, and impersonation.
*   **Affected Component:** Drupal Core (User module, password reset functionality).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Drupal's password recovery mechanism is configured securely (e.g., using strong random tokens for password reset links).
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced account security.
    *   Educate users on the importance of strong passwords and avoiding password reuse.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Drupal's Update Mechanism Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_drupal's_update_mechanism_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates the Drupal update process if it's not properly secured. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks to inject malicious code into update packages or exploiting vulnerabilities in the update mechanism itself.
*   **Impact:** Installation of backdoors or malware through compromised updates, leading to complete site compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Drupal Core (update manager).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the server's SSL/TLS configuration is strong and up-to-date.
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded update packages if possible.
    *   Restrict access to the Drupal update interface to authorized administrators only.
    *   Monitor the update process for any suspicious activity.
