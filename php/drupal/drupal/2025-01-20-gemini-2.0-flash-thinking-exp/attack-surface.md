# Attack Surface Analysis for drupal/drupal

## Attack Surface: [Drupal Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/drupal_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws within the core Drupal codebase that can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Drupal Contributes:** The complexity and extensive functionality of Drupal core can introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully developed and maintained. The database abstraction layer, rendering pipeline, and permission system are potential areas for flaws.
    *   **Example:** A SQL injection vulnerability in Drupal's node access system allows an attacker to bypass access controls and retrieve sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to complete site compromise, data breaches, defacement, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Drupal core updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Subscribe to Drupal security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom modules or patches for core.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in custom code.

## Attack Surface: [Contributed Modules and Themes Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/contributed_modules_and_themes_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in third-party modules and themes installed on the Drupal site.
    *   **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal's modular architecture encourages the use of contributed modules, which are developed by a wide range of individuals and organizations with varying levels of security expertise.
    *   **Example:** A popular module has an unpatched cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into pages viewed by other users.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from minor annoyances to complete site compromise, depending on the vulnerability and the module's privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the module's popularity and the severity of the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install modules and themes from trusted sources.
        *   Regularly check for updates to contributed modules and themes and apply them promptly.
        *   Review the security advisories for contributed modules.
        *   Consider the security track record and maintainership of modules before installation.
        *   Disable or uninstall unused modules and themes.

## Attack Surface: [Drupal Configuration and Settings](./attack_surfaces/drupal_configuration_and_settings.md)

*   **Description:** Security weaknesses arising from misconfigured Drupal settings.
    *   **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal offers numerous configuration options, and incorrect settings can expose vulnerabilities. Examples include insecure file system permissions, weak administrative passwords, or disabled security features.
    *   **Example:**  The "Update manager" module is enabled without proper access controls, allowing an attacker to remotely update Drupal with malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or the ability to inject malicious code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow Drupal security best practices for configuration.
        *   Use strong and unique passwords for administrative accounts.
        *   Restrict access to sensitive administrative pages.
        *   Properly configure file system permissions.
        *   Review and configure security-related modules like Flood Control and Security Kit.
        *   Disable unnecessary features and modules.

## Attack Surface: [Drupal's API and Web Services](./attack_surfaces/drupal's_api_and_web_services.md)

*   **Description:** Security risks associated with Drupal's built-in APIs (like RESTful Web Services) or contributed modules providing APIs.
    *   **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal's API framework, while powerful, requires careful implementation to prevent vulnerabilities like authentication bypass, injection flaws, or data exposure.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint lacks proper authentication, allowing anonymous users to access or modify sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for API endpoints.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize input received through API requests.
        *   Follow secure API development best practices.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Drupal's Update System](./attack_surfaces/drupal's_update_system.md)

*   **Description:** Risks associated with the process of updating Drupal core and contributed modules.
    *   **How Drupal Contributes:** While the update system is designed for security, vulnerabilities can arise if the process is not secure or if updates are not applied promptly.
    *   **Example:** A man-in-the-middle attack intercepts the update process and injects malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to complete site compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure updates are performed over HTTPS.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded update packages.
        *   Apply security updates promptly after they are released.
        *   Restrict access to the update management interface.

## Attack Surface: [Drupal's File System and Assets](./attack_surfaces/drupal's_file_system_and_assets.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to how Drupal manages uploaded files and assets.
    *   **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal's file handling mechanisms, if not properly secured, can allow attackers to upload malicious files or access sensitive files.
    *   **Example:**  Unrestricted file upload allows an attacker to upload a PHP script and execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Properly configure file upload settings to restrict allowed file types.
        *   Sanitize file names and content upon upload.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible.
        *   Implement access controls for uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Drupal's Plugin System (Modules and Themes)](./attack_surfaces/drupal's_plugin_system__modules_and_themes_.md)

*   **Description:** The inherent risk of relying on third-party code within Drupal's modular architecture.
    *   **How Drupal Contributes:** Drupal's strength lies in its extensibility, but this also introduces risk as the security of the site depends on the security of all installed modules and themes.
    *   **Example:** A popular theme contains a backdoor that allows an attacker to gain administrative access.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from minor issues to complete site compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise caution when installing modules and themes from unknown or untrusted sources.
        *   Regularly audit installed modules and themes for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in third-party code.
        *   Stay informed about security advisories for popular modules and themes.
