## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Drupal Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_drupal_core_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Drupal core is a high-risk path because these vulnerabilities are often publicly disclosed and actively targeted by attackers.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to critical outcomes like Remote Code Execution (RCE) or SQL Injection, granting the attacker significant control over the application and potentially the underlying server.
- **Why High-Risk:** The combination of public knowledge of vulnerabilities, readily available exploit code, and the potential for critical impact makes this a primary target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Achieving Remote Code Execution allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Drupal application. This can be achieved through various vulnerabilities in Drupal core or contributed modules.
- **Impact:** RCE grants the attacker complete control over the server, allowing them to steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.
- **Why Critical:** RCE represents the highest level of compromise, giving the attacker virtually unlimited capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: SQL Injection (Drupal Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_sql_injection__drupal_specific_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Drupal allow attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database interactions. This can occur in Drupal core or within contributed modules.
- **Impact:** Successful SQL Injection can lead to the bypass of authentication mechanisms, the extraction of sensitive data from the Drupal database, and potentially even Remote Code Execution in certain database configurations.
- **Why Critical:** SQL Injection is a common and powerful attack that can lead to significant data breaches and compromise of the application's integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Contributed Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_contributed_module_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Drupal's extensive module ecosystem introduces a significant attack surface. Outdated or poorly coded modules can contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
- **Impact:** Exploiting module vulnerabilities can lead to the same critical outcomes as core vulnerabilities, such as RCE and SQL Injection, but within the context of the specific module's functionality.
- **Why High-Risk:** The large number of contributed modules, the varying levels of security awareness among module developers, and the tendency for administrators to neglect module updates make this a high-risk area.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Remote Code Execution (RCE) within Drupal context](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_remote_code_execution__rce__within_drupal_context.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Similar to core RCE, but achieved through vulnerabilities within a specific contributed module.
- **Impact:** While potentially limited to the scope of the vulnerable module, successful exploitation can still lead to significant compromise, especially if the module has privileged access or handles sensitive data.
- **Why Critical:**  Allows for significant control within the Drupal application and potentially the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: SQL Injection vulnerabilities introduced by the module](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_the_module.md)

- **Attack Vector:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities specifically present within the code of a contributed module.
- **Impact:** Can lead to data breaches and manipulation within the module's specific data scope, and potentially broader compromise if the module interacts with sensitive core Drupal data.
- **Why Critical:** A common and impactful vulnerability type that can be introduced by third-party code.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Drupal's Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_drupal's_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Misconfigurations in the Drupal application or server environment can create exploitable weaknesses.
- **Impact:**  This path can lead to critical outcomes like gaining administrative access through default credentials or achieving code execution through insecure file uploads.
- **Why High-Risk:** Configuration errors are common and often overlooked, making them an easy target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Default or Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_default_or_weak_credentials.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Failing to change default administrator credentials or using easily guessable passwords allows attackers to gain direct administrative access through brute-force or simply trying default credentials.
- **Impact:** Full administrative control over the Drupal application.
- **Why Critical:** Provides immediate and complete access to the application with minimal effort for the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk: Default administrator credentials not changed](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_default_administrator_credentials_not_changed.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  The most basic form of credential exploitation, relying on administrators failing to perform a fundamental security step.
- **Impact:** Complete administrative takeover.
- **Why High-Risk:** Despite being a well-known security risk, it remains a surprisingly common vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk: Insecure File Upload Configuration (Drupal Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_insecure_file_upload_configuration__drupal_specific_.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Improperly configured file upload mechanisms in Drupal can allow attackers to upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts, and execute them on the server.
- **Impact:** Can lead to Remote Code Execution, granting the attacker full control.
- **Why High-Risk:** A common vulnerability in web applications, including Drupal, if not properly implemented with security in mind.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Social Engineering Targeting Drupal Administrators](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_social_engineering_targeting_drupal_administrators.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating Drupal administrators into revealing their credentials or performing actions that compromise the application's security.
- **Impact:** Can lead to critical outcomes like gaining administrative access or tricking administrators into installing malicious modules, both granting significant control to the attacker.
- **Why High-Risk:**  Human error is often the weakest link in security, and social engineering attacks can be highly effective.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk: Phishing for Administrator Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_phishing_for_administrator_credentials.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Deceiving administrators into providing their login credentials through fake login pages or emails.
- **Impact:**  Direct access to the Drupal administration panel.
- **Why High-Risk:**  A prevalent and often successful attack method.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk: Tricking Administrators into Installing Malicious Modules](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_tricking_administrators_into_installing_malicious_modules.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Convincing administrators to install malicious modules disguised as legitimate ones or through exploiting trust relationships.
- **Impact:**  Introduction of backdoors or other malicious functionality into the Drupal application.
- **Why High-Risk:**  Can provide persistent access and control to the attacker, and is difficult to detect without careful code review.
