    2.  **Check for Laminas Security Advisories:** Regularly monitor Laminas Project's security advisories and release notes for any reported vulnerabilities in Laminas MVC components or related libraries.
    3.  **Update Laminas Packages:** Utilize Composer to update outdated Laminas packages using `composer update laminas/*`.
    4.  **Test Laminas MVC Functionality:** After updating Laminas packages, thoroughly test core Laminas MVC functionalities, including routing, controllers, views, forms, and database interactions, to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.
    5.  **Deploy Updated Laminas MVC:** Once testing is successful, deploy the updated application with the latest Laminas MVC components to the production environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Laminas MVC and Dependencies (High Severity):** Exploits targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities specifically within Laminas MVC framework code or its direct dependencies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Laminas MVC and Dependencies:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities within the framework itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Laminas MVC updates are performed manually during general dependency updates, but not always immediately after Laminas security advisories.
    *   Location: Project's development and deployment process, `composer.json`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a process for proactively monitoring Laminas security advisories and applying updates specifically for Laminas components more frequently.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Configuration Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Externalize Laminas MVC Specific Configuration:** Identify sensitive configuration parameters within Laminas MVC configuration files (`module.config.php`, `autoload/*.config.php`, etc.), such as database credentials used by Laminas DB, API keys used in Laminas services, and any security-related settings.
    2.  **Environment Variables for Laminas Configuration:** Utilize environment variables to override sensitive configuration values defined in Laminas MVC configuration files. Access these variables within Laminas configuration arrays using placeholders or environment variable retrieval functions.
    3.  **Secure Storage for Laminas Configuration:** Ensure that the environment where these variables are stored (server environment, container environment, secret management tools) is securely managed and access is restricted.
    4.  **Avoid Hardcoding in Laminas Configuration:**  Refrain from hardcoding sensitive information directly within Laminas MVC configuration files.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Laminas Configuration (High Severity):** Accidental or intentional exposure of credentials within Laminas MVC configuration files, leading to unauthorized access to resources managed by the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Laminas Configuration:** High -  Significantly reduces the risk of credential exposure specifically within the application's Laminas MVC configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Database credentials used by Laminas DB are stored as environment variables and accessed in Laminas DB configuration. Some API keys used in Laminas services might still be in configuration files.
    *   Location: `.env` file, `config/autoload/db.local.php`, other `config/autoload/*.local.php` files.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Migrate all sensitive configurations used within Laminas MVC components (API keys, service credentials, etc.) to environment variables or a dedicated secret management solution, ensuring they are not directly present in configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debugging and Development Tools in Production](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debugging_and_development_tools_in_production.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Debugging and Development Tools in Production
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Laminas Development Modules:** Ensure modules like `ZendDeveloperTools` (if used) and any custom debugging modules built for Laminas MVC are explicitly disabled in the production `modules.config.php` or application configuration.
    2.  **Configure Laminas Error Handling:** Configure Laminas MVC's error handling to prevent detailed error messages from being displayed to users in production. Utilize Laminas's error handling mechanisms to log errors securely and display generic error pages.
    3.  **Remove Laminas Debugging Code:**  Review controllers, views, and services for any debugging code specific to Laminas MVC (e.g., `var_dump()` of Laminas objects, logging statements intended only for development within Laminas components) and remove them before production deployment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Leakage via Laminas MVC Error Handling (Medium Severity):** Exposure of internal application details, file paths, Laminas MVC structure, or database information through detailed error messages generated by Laminas MVC, aiding attackers in reconnaissance.
*   **Impact:**
