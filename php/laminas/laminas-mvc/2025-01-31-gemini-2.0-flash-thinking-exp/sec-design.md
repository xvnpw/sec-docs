# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Facilitate the development of robust, maintainable, and scalable web applications using the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.
 - Provide a flexible and extensible framework that adapts to diverse project requirements.
 - Foster a thriving community of developers through open-source collaboration and contribution.
 - Ensure long-term stability and support for applications built on the framework.
 - Enable rapid application development while maintaining code quality and security.
- Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities within the framework could compromise applications built upon it.
 - Lack of community support or decline in active development could lead to framework obsolescence.
 - Performance bottlenecks in the framework could negatively impact application performance.
 - Incompatibility issues with evolving PHP versions or other dependencies could disrupt application stability.
 - Complexity of the framework might increase the learning curve for new developers.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Open Source Codebase - The framework's source code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/laminas/laminas-mvc), allowing for community review and scrutiny.
 - security control: Community Review -  Being an open-source project, the codebase is subject to review by a wide community of developers, potentially identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Input Validation Features - The framework likely provides components and best practices for input validation to prevent common injection attacks (e.g., within form handling and data filtering components, described in framework documentation).
 - security control: Output Encoding Features - The framework likely provides components and best practices for output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks (e.g., within view rendering and template engines, described in framework documentation).
 - security control: CSRF Protection - The framework likely offers mechanisms to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks (e.g., form helpers and security middleware, described in framework documentation).
 - security control: Security Advisories -  The Laminas project likely publishes security advisories for reported vulnerabilities (check project website and security channels).
- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Public Disclosure of Vulnerabilities - As an open-source project, once a vulnerability is discovered and reported, it becomes publicly known before a patch might be available.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on Community for Security Patches - The speed and availability of security patches depend on the responsiveness of the community and maintainers.
 - accepted risk: Potential for Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities - The framework relies on third-party libraries, which could introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed and updated.
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools in the development pipeline to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in the framework code.
 - security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning - Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning tools to monitor and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the framework.
 - security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to thoroughly assess the framework's security posture and identify potential weaknesses.
 - security control: Security Champions Program - Establish a security champions program within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices throughout the development lifecycle.
 - security control: Bug Bounty Program - Consider implementing a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Applications built with the framework must be able to implement secure authentication mechanisms to verify user identities. The framework should provide components or guidance to facilitate secure authentication (e.g., session management, integration with authentication libraries).
 - Authorization:
  - Applications built with the framework must be able to implement robust authorization controls to manage user access to resources and functionalities. The framework should provide components or guidance to facilitate secure authorization (e.g., role-based access control, access control lists).
 - Input Validation:
  - The framework must encourage and facilitate comprehensive input validation to prevent injection attacks. This includes validating data from various sources (e.g., HTTP requests, file uploads, external APIs) against expected formats and constraints.
 - Cryptography:
  - The framework should support and promote the use of strong cryptography for protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit. This includes providing secure APIs for encryption, decryption, hashing, and secure random number generation. The framework should avoid insecure cryptographic practices and guide developers towards secure implementations.
