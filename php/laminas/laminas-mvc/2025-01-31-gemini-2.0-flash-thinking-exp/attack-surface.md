# Attack Surface Analysis for laminas/laminas-mvc

## Attack Surface: [Route Configuration Vulnerabilities - Overly Permissive Routes](./attack_surfaces/route_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_overly_permissive_routes.md)

*   **Description:** Routes defined too broadly can expose unintended application functionality, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Laminas MVC Contribution:** Laminas MVC's flexible routing system, if not carefully configured, can lead to overly permissive route definitions that match more URLs than intended.
*   **Example:** A route like `/admin/*` meant for the admin panel might unintentionally match URLs like `/admin/publicly-accessible-resource`, bypassing intended access restrictions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application features, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Define routes with specific and restrictive patterns.
    *   Utilize route constraints to limit parameter values and match only intended inputs.
    *   Regularly review route configurations to ensure they align with intended access control policies.
    *   Implement robust authorization checks within controllers to verify user permissions, regardless of route matching.

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Unvalidated route parameters can be used to inject malicious data into application logic, leading to various injection attacks.
*   **Laminas MVC Contribution:** Laminas MVC routes capture parameters from URLs and pass them to controllers. If these parameters are not sanitized and validated before use, injection vulnerabilities can occur.
*   **Example:** A route `/user/:id` where `:id` is directly used in a SQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id`. An attacker could inject SQL by providing an ID like `1' OR '1'='1`.
*   **Impact:** SQL Injection, Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (depending on parameter usage), data breaches, remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always validate and sanitize route parameters before using them in application logic.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Avoid directly passing route parameters to system commands. If necessary, strictly validate and escape them.
    *   Implement input filtering and validation using Laminas MVC's InputFilter component.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Controller/Action Execution due to Missing Access Control](./attack_surfaces/unintended_controlleraction_execution_due_to_missing_access_control.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper authorization checks in controllers and actions allows unauthorized users to execute sensitive functionalities.
*   **Laminas MVC Contribution:** Laminas MVC structures applications with controllers and actions. Developers must implement access control within these components. Missing or weak authorization allows direct access by manipulating dispatched controller/action names.
*   **Example:** An admin controller `AdminController` with a `deleteUserAction` is accessible without authentication. An attacker could directly access `/admin/delete-user` and execute the action.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms in controllers and actions.
    *   Use Laminas MVC's ACL or RBAC components or integrate with external authorization libraries.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions.
    *   Enforce authorization checks at the beginning of controller actions.

## Attack Surface: [Service Manager/Dependency Injection - Insecure Service Configuration](./attack_surfaces/service_managerdependency_injection_-_insecure_service_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure configuration of the Service Manager can lead to object injection vulnerabilities, potentially allowing remote code execution.
*   **Laminas MVC Contribution:** Laminas MVC's Service Manager is central to dependency injection. Insecure factory configurations that instantiate arbitrary classes based on user input can lead to object injection.
*   **Example:** A service factory configured to instantiate a class based on a request parameter. An attacker could manipulate this parameter to inject and instantiate a malicious class, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamically instantiating classes based on user input in service factories.
    *   Strictly control and validate service configurations.
    *   Prefer factory classes over invokables for better control over object creation.
    *   Regularly review service configurations for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Unsafe use of template engines can allow attackers to inject code into server-side templates, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Laminas MVC Contribution:** Laminas MVC uses template engines for views. Directly embedding user-controlled input into templates without proper escaping can lead to SSTI.
*   **Example:** A view template directly outputting a controller variable: `<?=$this->userInput?>`. If `userInput` contains template engine syntax (e.g., `{{ system('whoami') }}` for some template engines), it could be executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, data breaches, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always escape user-provided data before outputting it in templates using appropriate escaping functions.
    *   Avoid directly embedding raw user input into templates.
    *   Use template engines with automatic escaping features.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential SSTI or XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via View Helpers](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_view_helpers.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure view helpers that do not properly encode output can introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Laminas MVC Contribution:** Laminas MVC view helpers simplify template tasks. If view helpers, built-in or custom, don't properly encode output, they can become XSS vectors.
*   **Example:** A custom view helper outputting user text without HTML escaping. If used to display user comments, malicious script in a comment could execute in other users' browsers.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting, session hijacking, defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure all view helpers properly encode output based on context (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML).
    *   Use Laminas MVC's built-in escaping view helpers (e.g., `escapeHtml`, `escapeJs`).
    *   Review and audit custom view helpers for XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Storage - Plain Text Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_storage_-_plain_text_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Storing sensitive credentials in plain text configuration files exposes them to unauthorized access.
*   **Laminas MVC Contribution:** Laminas MVC uses configuration files. Developers might mistakenly store credentials directly in these files in plain text, making them vulnerable.
*   **Example:** Database credentials (username, password) stored in `config/autoload/db.local.php` in plain text. Compromise of this file leaks credentials.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized database/service access, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never store sensitive credentials in plain text configuration files.
    *   Use environment variables for sensitive configuration values.
    *   Utilize secure configuration management or secret management systems.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data in configuration files if environment variables are not feasible.
    *   Ensure configuration files have restricted file system permissions.
