# Attack Surface Analysis for laminas/laminas-mvc

## Attack Surface: [Route Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate routing parameters (e.g., in the URL) to access unintended parts of the application or trigger unexpected behavior.

**How Laminas MVC Contributes:** The framework's routing mechanism, which maps URLs to controllers and actions based on defined routes, can be exploited if route definitions are too broad or lack sufficient constraints.

**Example:** An application has a route `/user/:id`. An attacker might try `/user/../admin` hoping to bypass access controls if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the `id` parameter.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, bypassing security checks, potential for arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define Specific Route Constraints: Use regular expressions and constraints in route definitions to restrict the allowed values for route parameters.
*   Input Validation in Controllers:  Thoroughly validate all route parameters within the corresponding controller actions before using them.
*   Avoid Relying Solely on Route Matching for Security: Implement robust authorization checks within controllers, independent of the route.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Action Execution](./attack_surfaces/unintended_action_execution.md)

**Description:** Attackers directly access controller actions that are not intended for public use or lack proper security checks.

**How Laminas MVC Contributes:** The framework's convention-based routing, where action names often correspond to methods in controllers, can make it easier for attackers to guess and attempt to access internal actions.

**Example:** A controller `AdminController` has an action `deleteUserAction`. If not properly secured, an attacker might try to access `/admin/delete-user` directly.

**Impact:** Execution of privileged actions without authorization, data manipulation, potential for denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly Define Public Actions:  Use annotations or configuration to clearly mark actions intended for public access.
*   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Use Laminas's or a third-party RBAC system to control access to specific actions based on user roles and permissions.
*   Restrict HTTP Methods:  Specify the allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for each action to prevent unintended access through different methods.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into view templates, which is then executed on the server.

**How Laminas MVC Contributes:** If user-supplied data is directly embedded into view scripts (templates) without proper escaping or sanitization, the template engine (e.g., PhpRenderer) can interpret and execute malicious code.

**Example:** A view script uses `<?php echo $this->userInput; ?>` where `$userInput` comes directly from a user request. An attacker could inject template engine syntax like `{{ system('whoami') }}` (if using a template engine like Twig and not properly escaped).

**Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), full server compromise, access to sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always Escape User-Supplied Data:  Use appropriate escaping functions (e.g., `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP) when displaying user input in templates.
*   Use a Secure Template Engine:  Choose template engines with built-in security features and keep them updated.
*   Avoid Direct Variable Output:  Prefer using template engine features for outputting variables, which often provide automatic escaping.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating some consequences of successful SSTI.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (with Laminas\Form)](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities__with_laminasform_.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate form data to set unintended object properties, potentially leading to security breaches or data corruption.

**How Laminas MVC Contributes:** If using Laminas\Form and binding form data directly to objects without strict filtering and whitelisting of allowed fields, attackers can inject extra data.

**Example:** A user registration form is bound to a `User` entity. An attacker might add an `isAdmin` field to the form data, potentially elevating their privileges if the application blindly assigns all form data.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, bypassing security checks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Fieldsets and Input Filters: Define explicit fieldsets in your forms and use input filters to specify which fields are allowed and how they should be validated and sanitized.
*   Whitelist Allowed Fields:  When binding form data to objects, explicitly specify the allowed properties to prevent unintended assignments.
*   Avoid Direct Binding of Request Data:  Consider mapping form data to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) first and then selectively transferring data to your domain entities.

## Attack Surface: [CSRF Vulnerabilities (with Laminas\Form)](./attack_surfaces/csrf_vulnerabilities__with_laminasform_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application.

**How Laminas MVC Contributes:** While Laminas\Form provides built-in CSRF protection, it needs to be explicitly enabled and configured correctly. Failure to do so leaves the application vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link or form that, when clicked by an authenticated user, submits a request to the application to change the user's password or make a purchase without their knowledge.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users, data manipulation, financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable CSRF Protection in Forms:  Use the `Csrf` form element in your Laminas\Form instances.
*   Verify CSRF Tokens: Ensure that the CSRF token is correctly generated and validated on form submissions.
*   Synchronizer Token Pattern: Understand and implement the synchronizer token pattern used by Laminas\Form for CSRF protection.
