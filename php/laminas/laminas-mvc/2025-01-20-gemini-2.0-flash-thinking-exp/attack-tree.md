## Attack Tree Path: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_tree_paths/route_parameter_injection.md)

* Description: An attacker manipulates route parameters by injecting malicious code or unexpected values. This can lead to unintended code execution, such as including and executing arbitrary files, or accessing sensitive data by bypassing intended access controls.
    * Attack Vector: Modifying the URL to include malicious payloads within the parameters expected by the application's routing system. For example, changing `/user/{id}` to `/user/../../../../etc/passwd` if the `id` parameter is used unsafely in file operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Input Handling in Actions](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_input_handling_in_actions.md)

* Description: Controller actions fail to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input. This allows attackers to inject malicious code, such as SQL injection payloads, command injection sequences, or script code, which is then executed by the application.
    * Attack Vector: Submitting malicious data through forms, query parameters, or request bodies that are directly used in database queries, system commands, or other sensitive operations without proper escaping or validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Module Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_module_dependencies.md)

* Description: The application relies on third-party modules that contain known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application, even if the core Laminas MVC code is secure.
    * Attack Vector: Identifying vulnerable dependencies using tools like dependency checkers and then leveraging known exploits for those specific versions of the libraries. This could involve sending crafted requests or providing specific input that triggers the vulnerability in the dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Accessing Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/accessing_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

* Description: Attackers gain unauthorized access to configuration files that contain sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or internal system details. This information can then be used for further attacks.
    * Attack Vector: Exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities (e.g., Local File Inclusion - LFI), directory traversal vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations in the web server that allow direct access to configuration files like `application.config.php` or `.env` files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Server](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_server.md)

* Description: This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means the attacker has gained the ability to run any code they choose on the server hosting the application, leading to complete compromise.
    * Significance: Represents the highest level of impact and the culmination of successful exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Laminas MVC Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_laminas_mvc_components.md)

* Description: This node represents the broad category of attacks that specifically target weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Laminas MVC framework itself.
    * Significance: Highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating framework-specific risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Controllers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_controllers.md)

* Description: Controllers handle the core application logic and user input. Vulnerabilities here can directly lead to code execution or data breaches.
    * Significance: Emphasizes the need for secure coding practices within controller actions, especially regarding input handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Input Handling in Actions](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_input_handling_in_actions.md)

* Description: As described in the High-Risk Paths, this specific attack vector is critical due to its high likelihood and severe impact.
    * Significance: Represents a direct and common path to achieving arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Service Manager/Dependency Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_service_managerdependency_injection.md)

* Description: The Service Manager controls the instantiation and management of application components. Compromising it can allow attackers to inject malicious services or overwrite legitimate ones, gaining widespread control.
    * Significance: Represents a powerful attack vector that can undermine the entire application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* Description: This node encompasses attacks that target the application's configuration. Successful exploitation can expose sensitive data or allow modification of critical settings.
    * Significance: Highlights the importance of secure configuration management and protecting access to configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Accessing Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/accessing_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

* Description: As described in the High-Risk Paths, gaining access to configuration data is a critical step for attackers as it provides valuable information for further attacks.
    * Significance: Represents a significant information disclosure vulnerability with severe consequences.
