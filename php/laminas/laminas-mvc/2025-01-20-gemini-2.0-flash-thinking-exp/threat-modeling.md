# Threat Model Analysis for laminas/laminas-mvc

## Threat: [Route Parameter Manipulation](./threats/route_parameter_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates URL parameters (e.g., IDs, names) within the route to access resources or trigger actions they are not authorized for. They might guess parameter values, brute-force them, or exploit predictable patterns. This directly leverages the Laminas MVC routing mechanism.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, modification of data belonging to other users, execution of unintended application logic, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** `Laminas\Mvc\Router\RouteMatch`, `Laminas\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController` (actions relying on route parameters).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Define strict route constraints using regular expressions or custom route segments within the Laminas MVC routing configuration.
* Implement robust authorization checks within controller actions, verifying the user's right to access the resource identified by the route parameter.
* Avoid relying solely on route parameters for security decisions.
* Use UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers where appropriate.

## Threat: [Unintended Action Execution via Dispatcher Bypass](./threats/unintended_action_execution_via_dispatcher_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts requests or exploits vulnerabilities in custom dispatchers or event listeners to bypass the standard Laminas MVC routing and dispatching process, directly invoking controller actions without proper authorization or input validation.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application context, bypassing security checks, potential for privilege escalation or data manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `Laminas\Mvc\DispatchListener`, `Laminas\EventManager\EventManager` (if custom listeners are vulnerable).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input used in custom dispatchers or event listeners that influence action execution.
* Avoid directly invoking controller actions based on user-provided data without proper authorization.
* Adhere to the principle of least privilege when designing custom dispatchers and event listeners.

## Threat: [View Helper Vulnerabilities (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./threats/view_helper_vulnerabilities__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious client-side scripts (JavaScript) into web pages rendered by the application by exploiting improper or missing output escaping in Laminas MVC view helpers. This can occur when displaying user-provided data or data from untrusted sources within templates.

**Impact:** Stealing user credentials (session cookies), redirecting users to malicious websites, defacing websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected Component:** `Laminas\View\Helper\*` (especially helpers rendering user-provided data like `escapeHtml`, `escapeJs`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use appropriate escaping view helpers (e.g., `escapeHtml`, `escapeJs`) provided by Laminas MVC when rendering user-provided data or data from untrusted sources.
* Be mindful of the context when escaping data (e.g., escaping for HTML attributes vs. JavaScript).
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Event Listener Injection/Abuse](./threats/event_listener_injectionabuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious event listeners into the application's Laminas MVC event manager, allowing them to intercept events and execute arbitrary code or manipulate the application's flow. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in administrative interfaces or configuration mechanisms interacting with the event manager.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application context, manipulation of application logic, potential for data breaches or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `Laminas\EventManager\EventManager`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid allowing dynamic registration of event listeners based on untrusted input.
* Implement strict access controls for managing event listeners.
* Sanitize and validate any input used in event listener registration.

## Threat: [Service Overriding/Hijacking](./threats/service_overridinghijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker replaces legitimate services within the Laminas Service Manager with malicious implementations. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in service factories or configuration mechanisms, allowing them to control application components or data flow managed by the Service Manager.

**Impact:** Complete control over application components, data manipulation, arbitrary code execution, potential for full application compromise.

**Affected Component:** `Laminas\ServiceManager\ServiceManager`, `Laminas\ServiceManager\Factory\*`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to service manager configuration files and mechanisms.
* Ensure that service factories are secure and do not introduce vulnerabilities.
* Use immutable configuration where possible to prevent runtime modification of service definitions.

## Threat: [Module Autoloader Vulnerabilities](./threats/module_autoloader_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in the Laminas MVC module autoloader to trick the application into loading malicious code from unexpected locations. This could involve placing malicious files in directories where the autoloader searches based on the framework's configuration.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application context, potentially leading to full application compromise.

**Affected Component:** `Laminas\ModuleManager\Listener\AutoloaderListener`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure the autoloader to only load classes from trusted locations.
* Restrict write access to directories where the autoloader searches for class files.
* Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized file modifications.
