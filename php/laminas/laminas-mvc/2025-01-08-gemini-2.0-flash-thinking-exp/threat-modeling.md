# Threat Model Analysis for laminas/laminas-mvc

## Threat: [Insecure Route Definition Exploitation](./threats/insecure_route_definition_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious URLs that, due to overly permissive or poorly defined route patterns within Laminas MVC's routing component, are unexpectedly matched to internal application actions or functionalities not intended for public access. This could involve manipulating URL segments or parameters.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features, potential execution of unintended code paths, information disclosure, or denial of service by overloading specific actions.

**Affected Component:** `Laminas\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack` (the HTTP routing component).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use specific and restrictive route definitions with clear constraints on URL segments within Laminas MVC's routing configuration.
* Avoid using overly broad wildcard patterns in routes.
* Implement thorough testing of route configurations to identify potential ambiguities or unintended matches.
* Regularly review and audit route definitions.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via View Helpers or Template Engines](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_view_helpers_or_template_engines.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into templates if user-controlled data is directly rendered without proper sanitization or escaping. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in custom view helpers provided by Laminas MVC or the underlying template engine (e.g., PhpRenderer) integrated with Laminas. The injected code would then be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach, modification of application logic.

**Affected Component:** `Laminas\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer` (or other configured template renderers within Laminas MVC), custom view helpers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always escape output data based on the context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) using Laminas' built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., the `escapeHtml` view helper).
* Avoid directly concatenating user input into template strings.
* If using a third-party template engine integrated with Laminas, ensure it is up-to-date and has proper auto-escaping enabled.
* Sanitize user input before passing it to the view layer, although escaping at the output is the primary defense.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability through Request Data Binding](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability_through_request_data_binding.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate HTTP request parameters to modify object properties that were not intended to be directly accessible through user input. If controllers within the Laminas MVC framework directly bind request data to entity properties without proper filtering or whitelisting, attackers can potentially alter sensitive data or application state.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation (if roles or permissions are affected), bypassing business logic.

**Affected Component:** Controller actions within the Laminas MVC framework, potentially data mappers or entity classes if direct binding is used.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use input filters and validation rules provided by Laminas to explicitly define which request parameters are allowed and how they should be processed.
* Employ Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or specific input filter classes within the Laminas MVC context to control data binding.
* Avoid directly binding request data to entity properties without careful consideration and filtering in controller actions.
