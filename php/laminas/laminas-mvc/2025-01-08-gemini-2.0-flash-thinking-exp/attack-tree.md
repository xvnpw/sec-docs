## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unvalidated Route Parameters -> Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unvalidated_route_parameters_-_insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious URLs by manipulating route parameters. If the application doesn't properly validate these parameters, the attacker can supply unexpected values. This can lead to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), where the manipulated route parameter directly references a database record or file without proper authorization checks.

**Example:** A URL like `/users/profile/123` might be changed to `/users/profile/456` to access another user's profile if the `123` parameter is not validated and authorization is missing.

**Risk:** Relatively easy to exploit (Medium likelihood for unvalidated parameters), leading to significant impact (accessing unauthorized data).

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Input Handling in Actions](./attack_tree_paths/improper_input_handling_in_actions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers provide unexpected or malicious input to controller actions. If this input is not properly validated or sanitized, it can lead to various vulnerabilities.

**Examples:**

*   Injecting malicious scripts into form fields that are later displayed without escaping (XSS).
*   Providing specially crafted input that is used in database queries without sanitization (potentially leading to SQL injection, though less directly a Laminas MVC issue).
*   Sending overly long strings or unexpected data types that cause application errors or crashes.

**Risk:**  Highly likely (common developer oversight), with the potential to lead to significant vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Output](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_output.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into data that is later rendered in the application's templates. If the templating engine does not properly escape this data, the malicious script will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Example:** A user-provided comment containing `<script>alert('You have been hacked!');</script>` is displayed on the page without escaping, causing the alert to pop up in other users' browsers.

**Risk:**  Medium to high likelihood if developers are not careful, leading to a moderate impact (client-side compromise, data theft, session hijacking).

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) without Proper Protection](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__without_proper_protection.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks an authenticated user into making unintended requests on the application. This is possible if the application does not implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms (like CSRF tokens).

**Example:** An attacker sends a link or embeds an image tag in an email that, when clicked or loaded by an authenticated user, sends a request to the application to change the user's password or perform other actions.

**Risk:** Medium to high likelihood if CSRF protection is missing, leading to a moderate to significant impact (unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Internal Routes](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_internal_routes.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The application exposes routes that are intended for internal use only. Attackers who discover these routes can gain access to sensitive information or administrative functionalities that should not be publicly accessible.

**Risk:** Moderate to Critical impact, as it can directly lead to access to sensitive data or administrative control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers manipulate route parameters or other identifiers to directly access resources (database records, files) that belong to other users or are otherwise restricted. This occurs when authorization checks are insufficient.

**Risk:** Significant impact, as it allows attackers to bypass access controls and potentially steal or manipulate sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code into template variables that are processed by the server-side templating engine. If not properly handled, this code can be executed on the server.

**Risk:** Critical impact, as it allows for remote code execution, giving the attacker complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting Malicious Event Listeners](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_malicious_event_listeners.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers find a way to register or inject malicious event listeners into the application's event management system. These listeners can intercept and manipulate application flow or data in unintended ways.

**Risk:** Critical impact, as it allows for deep manipulation of the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwriting Service Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/overwriting_service_definitions.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the service manager to overwrite existing service definitions with malicious implementations. This allows them to replace legitimate components with their own malicious code.

**Risk:** Critical impact, as it can compromise core application functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injecting Malicious Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/injecting_malicious_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the dependency injection mechanism to inject malicious objects or services into the application. This can allow them to control the behavior of dependent components.

**Risk:** Critical impact, as it can lead to various forms of compromise depending on the injected dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Accessing Sensitive Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/accessing_sensitive_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to access configuration files (e.g., `config/autoload/*.global.php`, `config/autoload/*.local.php`) that contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or other secrets.

**Risk:** Critical impact, as exposure of these credentials can lead to widespread compromise of the application and related systems.
