# Attack Surface Analysis for laminas/laminas-mvc

## Attack Surface: [Route Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/route_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application defines and processes routes to access unintended controllers or actions.
    *   **How Laminas MVC Contributes:** Laminas MVC's routing system relies on configuration (often in `module.config.php`) to map URLs to specific handlers. If this configuration is dynamically generated based on untrusted input or lacks proper validation, attackers can inject malicious route patterns or manipulate existing ones.
    *   **Example:** An application dynamically generates routes based on user-provided categories. If the category name isn't sanitized, an attacker could inject a route like `/../../admin/dashboard` to bypass intended access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, execution of unintended code, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic route generation based on untrusted input. If necessary, strictly sanitize and validate the input used for route generation.
        *   Use explicit route definitions in configuration files rather than relying on dynamic generation where possible.
        *   Implement proper input validation for route parameters.
        *   Regularly review route configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Action Execution (Lack of Authorization)](./attack_surfaces/unintended_action_execution__lack_of_authorization_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass intended access controls and execute controller actions they are not authorized to access.
    *   **How Laminas MVC Contributes:** While Laminas MVC provides tools for authorization, the framework itself doesn't enforce it. Developers are responsible for implementing authorization checks within controllers or through event listeners. Failure to do so, or incorrect implementation, creates this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A controller action for deleting user accounts lacks an authorization check. An attacker could directly access the URL for this action and delete accounts without proper privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks within controller actions or through the event manager.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   Centralize authorization logic.
        *   Test authorization rules thoroughly.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template files, which is then executed on the server when the template is rendered.
    *   **How Laminas MVC Contributes:** If user-provided data is directly embedded into view templates without proper escaping, or if developers use template features that allow for code execution without careful consideration, SSTI vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses a template helper that directly renders user-provided HTML without escaping. An attacker could inject code like `<script>/* malicious code */</script>` which could execute in the user's browser (XSS) or potentially on the server if the template engine allows server-side code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, complete compromise of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data in templates using Laminas MVC's escaping mechanisms.
        *   Avoid direct PHP execution in templates.
        *   Use a secure template engine.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Forms](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__in_forms.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application.
    *   **How Laminas MVC Contributes:** Laminas MVC provides built-in features for CSRF protection through form helpers and middleware. Failure to implement or configure these features correctly leaves the application vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A form for updating user profile information does not include a CSRF token. An attacker could craft a malicious website that submits a request to the profile update endpoint, potentially changing the victim's information without their knowledge.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized state changes, data manipulation, financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Laminas MVC's CSRF protection in all state-changing forms.
        *   Validate CSRF tokens on the server-side.
        *   Use appropriate HTTP methods (POST for state changes).
