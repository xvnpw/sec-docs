# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Livewire, aims to simplify the development of dynamic interfaces using Laravel and PHP. It allows developers to build modern, reactive web applications without extensive JavaScript knowledge, by writing backend code in PHP that interacts with the frontend.

Business priorities for projects using Livewire are likely focused on rapid development and ease of maintenance of web applications. The goal is to deliver interactive user experiences efficiently, leveraging the existing Laravel ecosystem and PHP skills.

The most important business risks associated with Livewire projects revolve around security vulnerabilities that could impact applications built using it. These risks include:

- Web application vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection) in Livewire itself or in applications built with it, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
- Dependency vulnerabilities in Livewire's dependencies, which could be exploited to compromise applications.
- Availability and performance issues if Livewire introduces bottlenecks or inefficiencies in web applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for Livewire projects are primarily inherited from the underlying Laravel framework and general web application security best practices.

- security control: Laravel framework's built-in security features, including protection against common web vulnerabilities like CSRF, SQL injection, and XSS. Implemented within the Laravel framework itself.
- security control: Use of HTTPS for secure communication between the browser and the server. Typically configured at the web server or load balancer level.
- security control: Input validation and sanitization provided by Laravel's validation mechanisms and Eloquent ORM. Implemented within Laravel applications using Livewire.
- security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by Laravel's built-in features like Laravel Sanctum or Passport. Implemented within Laravel applications using Livewire.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in Livewire.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party JavaScript dependencies used by Livewire.

Recommended security controls to enhance the security posture of Livewire projects:

- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- recommended security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to continuously monitor and manage dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of applications built with Livewire to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
- recommended security control: Provide security training for developers on secure coding practices for Livewire and Laravel applications, focusing on common web application vulnerabilities and secure component design.

Security requirements for Livewire projects:

- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Securely authenticate users accessing applications built with Livewire.
  - Requirement: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive applications or user roles.
  - Requirement: Protect authentication credentials in transit and at rest.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to application features and data based on user roles.
  - Requirement: Enforce authorization checks at the component and data level to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Requirement: Regularly review and update authorization policies.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Validate all user inputs on both the client-side and server-side to prevent injection attacks and data integrity issues.
  - Requirement: Sanitize user inputs before displaying them to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
  - Requirement: Use Laravel's validation features and Livewire's form handling capabilities to enforce input validation rules.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols for protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest.
  - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and secrets.
  - Requirement: Leverage Laravel's encryption features for data at rest encryption where necessary.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by Livewire projects are the functionalities of the web applications built using it. These processes vary depending on the specific application but could include e-commerce transactions, user data management, content delivery, or business-critical workflows.

Data protected by Livewire projects depends on the application. It can range from publicly accessible content to highly sensitive user data (PII, financial information, health records) or confidential business data. The sensitivity of the data directly impacts the potential business impact of a security breach. For applications handling sensitive data, the data sensitivity is high. For applications with public content, the data sensitivity is low. However, even for public content applications, availability and integrity are critical.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the risk appetite of organizations using Livewire? Is it primarily used by startups with higher risk tolerance or also by larger enterprises with stricter security requirements?
- What are the typical deployment environments for Livewire applications? Cloud, on-premise, hybrid? Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) that need to be considered?
- What is the expected level of security expertise of developers using Livewire? Are they expected to be security experts, or should Livewire provide more built-in security features and guidance for less security-focused developers?
- Are there specific types of applications (e.g., e-commerce, dashboards, public websites) that are more commonly built with Livewire, and do these application types have specific security considerations?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: We assume that projects using Livewire prioritize rapid development and ease of maintenance, but security is still a significant concern, especially for applications handling sensitive data.
- SECURITY POSTURE: We assume that existing security controls are primarily based on Laravel's features and general web security practices. We assume a need for enhanced security controls like SAST/DAST and dependency scanning to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- DESIGN: We assume a cloud-based deployment scenario as a common and scalable option. We assume a standard CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for build automation and security checks.
