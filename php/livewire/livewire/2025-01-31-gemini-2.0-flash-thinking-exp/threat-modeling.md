# Threat Model Analysis for livewire/livewire

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Public Properties](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_public_properties.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates HTTP request parameters to modify public properties of a Livewire component that were not intended to be user-editable. They can achieve this by inspecting the component's public properties and crafting requests with modified values. This allows them to potentially alter application state or gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, potential compromise of application logic, data integrity issues.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Livewire Components with publicly accessible properties, particularly those handling sensitive data or application state.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Use `$fillable` and `$guarded` properties in Eloquent models to control mass assignment.
*   Implement server-side input validation within Livewire component methods.
*   Enforce authorization checks before updating sensitive properties or performing actions based on user input.
*   Minimize the number of public properties and carefully consider which properties are exposed.

## Threat: [Insecure Property Binding and Data Injection](./threats/insecure_property_binding_and_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code or data through user-controlled properties that are used within Livewire components to construct dynamic queries, commands, or outputs. This can occur if developers fail to properly sanitize or escape user input *within the component logic* before using it in operations like database queries or shell commands.

**Impact:** SQL Injection, Command Injection, other forms of injection vulnerabilities, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Livewire Components that dynamically construct queries or commands based on user-provided properties, especially within component methods and lifecycle hooks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.
*   Sanitize and validate all user inputs within Livewire component methods before using them in dynamic operations.
*   Ensure proper output encoding when rendering user-provided data, considering context-specific encoding needs.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to database users and system accounts used by the application.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Controlled URLs in Livewire Actions](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_user-controlled_urls_in_livewire_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a malicious URL as input to a Livewire action that processes external URLs (e.g., for fetching resources). The attacker can then force the server to make requests to internal network resources or arbitrary external sites, potentially exposing internal services or performing actions on behalf of the server.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, denial of service, potential remote code execution if vulnerable internal services are targeted.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Livewire Actions and component logic that handle user-provided URLs for external resource access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict URL validation and sanitization, using allowlists for permitted domains or protocols.
*   Restrict network access from the application server to only necessary external resources using firewalls.
*   Avoid directly processing user-provided URLs if possible; consider indirect methods for resource access.
*   Use SSRF protection libraries or functions when handling URLs.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Livewire Actions](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_livewire_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates predictable identifiers (like database IDs) passed from the frontend to Livewire actions to access or modify resources they are not authorized to interact with. They can guess or enumerate IDs and bypass access controls if actions lack proper authorization checks based on the current user and the requested resource.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, potential data breaches.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Livewire Actions that handle data related to specific entities and rely on identifiers passed from the frontend.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust authorization checks within each Livewire action to verify user authorization for the requested resource.
*   Use UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) instead of sequential database IDs to make ID guessing harder.
*   Consider using indirect object references or access control lists to manage resource access.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Livewire Actions](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_livewire_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to access or execute Livewire actions that perform sensitive operations without proper authorization. This occurs when developers fail to implement or correctly implement authorization checks *within the Livewire action logic*, assuming server-side execution is inherently secure.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, privilege escalation, data breaches, unauthorized data modification.

**Affected Livewire Component:** All Livewire Actions that handle sensitive operations, such as data modification, deletion, or access to restricted resources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Explicitly implement authorization checks at the beginning of every Livewire action that handles sensitive operations.
*   Utilize framework's authorization features (like policies in Laravel) to enforce access control rules within Livewire actions.
*   Conduct regular security audits to identify and address any missing or weak authorization checks in Livewire actions.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Improper Handling of Livewire Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_improper_handling_of_livewire_output.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the application that are then executed in the browsers of other users. While Livewire provides default output escaping, developers might bypass this escaping or introduce raw HTML rendering without proper sanitization, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Livewire Components that render user-provided data or handle raw HTML, especially when using `@entangle` with unescaped data or manually rendering HTML.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always ensure proper output encoding for user-provided data, even with Livewire's default escaping, considering context-specific needs.
*   Avoid disabling Livewire's automatic escaping mechanisms unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
*   If rendering user-provided HTML is required, use a robust HTML sanitization library to remove potentially malicious code.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
