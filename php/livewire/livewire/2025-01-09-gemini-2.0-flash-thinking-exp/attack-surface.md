# Attack Surface Analysis for livewire/livewire

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment via Public Properties](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_via_public_properties.md)

**Description:** Attackers can potentially modify backend model properties by manipulating the data sent during Livewire updates, targeting publicly accessible properties in the component.

**How Livewire Contributes:** Livewire automatically binds public properties of a component to the frontend, making them directly updatable through the Livewire JavaScript.

**Example:** A user profile component has a public `$isAdmin` property. An attacker could potentially intercept the Livewire update request and set `$isAdmin` to `true`, granting themselves administrative privileges.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, potential compromise of application logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use `$fillable` or `$guarded` on Eloquent models:  Explicitly define which attributes can be mass-assigned.
*   Validate input data:  Thoroughly validate all data received from the frontend before updating model properties.
*   Avoid exposing sensitive properties publicly:  Limit the number of public properties and carefully consider which data is exposed.
*   Use computed properties or methods for derived data:  Instead of making derived values public properties, calculate them on the fly.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input in Livewire Actions](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_in_livewire_actions.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious input into parameters of Livewire actions, potentially leading to server-side vulnerabilities.

**How Livewire Contributes:** Livewire allows triggering backend methods (actions) from the frontend, passing data as parameters.

**Example:** A delete action takes a `$userId` parameter. An attacker could inject an SQL injection payload as the `$userId`, potentially compromising the database.

**Impact:** SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting (if output is not sanitized), other server-side vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate all input:  Use appropriate sanitization and validation techniques for all data received in action parameters.
*   Use prepared statements/parameterized queries:  Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements when interacting with the database.
*   Implement proper authorization checks:  Ensure users are authorized to perform the actions they are attempting to trigger.
*   Output encoding:  Encode data before displaying it in the frontend to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Public Properties](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_public_properties.md)

**Description:**  Developers might unintentionally expose sensitive information through public properties of Livewire components.

**How Livewire Contributes:** Public properties are directly accessible and their values are sent to the frontend during rendering and updates.

**Example:** A component might have a public `$apiKey` property that is accidentally exposed, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive API keys.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential compromise of external services or internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review all public properties:  Ensure no sensitive information is being exposed unintentionally.
*   Use protected or private properties for sensitive data:  Limit the scope of access for sensitive information.
*   Utilize computed properties or methods for displaying data:  Transform or filter data before it's sent to the frontend.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (Specific to Livewire's File Upload Feature)](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities__specific_to_livewire's_file_upload_feature_.md)

**Description:**  Improper handling of file uploads in Livewire components can lead to various vulnerabilities.

**How Livewire Contributes:** Livewire provides a convenient way to handle file uploads within components.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image, which is then executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, cross-site scripting, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate file types:  Only allow specific and safe file types.
*   Sanitize file names:  Remove or replace potentially harmful characters from file names.
*   Limit file sizes:  Prevent excessively large uploads that could lead to denial of service.
*   Store uploaded files outside the web root:  Prevent direct execution of uploaded files.
*   Use a dedicated storage service:  Consider using services like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for file uploads.
*   Scan uploaded files for malware:  Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.
