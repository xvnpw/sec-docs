# Threat Model Analysis for livewire/livewire

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Livewire Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_livewire_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is subsequently rendered by a Livewire component without proper sanitization. When another user views the component, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting them to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf. For example, a comment section powered by Livewire might be vulnerable if user-submitted comments are not properly escaped.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application, spreading malware.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Component Rendering, Blade Integration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always sanitize user input before displaying it in Livewire views.
*   Utilize Blade's escaping mechanisms (`{{ $variable }}`) which are enabled by default in Livewire.
*   Be extremely cautious when using `{!! $unescaped_variable !!}` for unescaped output and ensure the data source is absolutely trusted.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in Livewire Components](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_in_livewire_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the data sent in a Livewire request to include unexpected or unauthorized attributes. If the Livewire component directly updates an Eloquent model using this data without proper guarding, the attacker could potentially modify database columns they shouldn't have access to. For example, they might try to set an `is_admin` flag to `true`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of database records, privilege escalation.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Data Binding, Property Updates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize Laravel's `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on your Eloquent models to explicitly control which attributes can be mass-assigned.
*   Be mindful of which Livewire properties are publicly accessible and bound to model attributes.
*   Consider using dedicated form request objects for validating and sanitizing input before updating models.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Livewire Actions](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_livewire_actions.md)

**Description:** A Livewire action relies on a user-provided ID (e.g., in a route parameter or form data) to access a specific resource. If there are no proper authorization checks, an attacker can manipulate this ID to access resources belonging to other users. For example, changing the `post_id` in an edit action to access another user's post.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification or deletion of resources.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Action Handling, Route Parameter Binding.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always implement authorization checks within your Livewire action methods to ensure the current user has the necessary permissions to access or modify the requested resource.
*   Utilize Laravel's policies and gates for authorization.
*   Avoid directly exposing internal IDs in URLs or form data if possible. Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Livewire Actions](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_livewire_actions.md)

**Description:** User input received by a Livewire action is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used in database queries or other system commands. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL, shell commands, or other code that is then executed by the server. For example, using unsanitized input directly in a raw SQL query.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, remote code execution, denial of service.

**Affected Livewire Component:** Action Handling, Data Processing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always sanitize and validate user input received in Livewire actions.
*   Use parameterized queries or Eloquent's query builder to prevent SQL injection.
*   Avoid directly executing user-provided data as system commands. If necessary, sanitize the input thoroughly and use appropriate escaping mechanisms.

## Threat: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (using Livewire's file upload feature)](./threats/file_upload_vulnerabilities__using_livewire's_file_upload_feature_.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file through a Livewire component's file upload functionality. This file could be a web shell, malware, or a file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the server's file processing or storage mechanisms.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach, defacement.

**Affected Livewire Component:** File Uploads.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict validation on file uploads, including file type, size, and content (using techniques like magic number verification).
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot to prevent direct execution.
*   Generate unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.
*   Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software.
*   Set appropriate permissions on uploaded files and directories.
