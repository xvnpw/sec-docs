# Attack Surface Analysis for livewire/livewire

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can modify object properties by manipulating request parameters.
- **How Livewire Contributes:** Livewire's automatic data binding can inadvertently allow attackers to modify component properties that were not intended to be directly user-modifiable. When Livewire receives updates from the front-end, it attempts to set the corresponding public properties on the component.
- **Example:** A user profile component has a public property `$isAdmin`. An attacker could send a Livewire update request with `isAdmin=1`, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges if this property isn't properly guarded.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, unexpected application behavior.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use `$fillable` and `$guarded` properties: Explicitly define which properties are allowed for mass assignment (`$fillable`) or which are protected (`$guarded`) within your Livewire components.
    - Input Validation: Validate all incoming data within your Livewire component's update lifecycle methods (e.g., `updated()`, specific property update hooks).
    - Avoid making sensitive properties public: Carefully consider which properties need to be public and accessible for data binding.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Method Calls (Action Handling)](./attack_surfaces/unintended_method_calls__action_handling_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can trigger component methods that were not intended to be publicly accessible or call them in an unintended sequence.
- **How Livewire Contributes:** Livewire allows triggering public methods on components from the front-end using actions (e.g., `wire:click`). If authorization checks are missing or insufficient, attackers can potentially call sensitive methods.
- **Example:** A component has a method `deleteUser($userId)`. An attacker could inspect the HTML or Livewire updates and craft a request to call this method with a different user ID, potentially deleting other users' accounts if no proper authorization is in place.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, potential security breaches.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement Authorization Checks: Always perform authorization checks within your Livewire action methods to ensure the current user has the necessary permissions to execute the action. Use policies or other authorization mechanisms.
    - Avoid exposing sensitive logic directly as public methods: Consider encapsulating sensitive logic within private or protected methods and calling them from authorized public methods.
    - Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on critical actions to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Rendering](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsafe_rendering.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by other users' browsers.
- **How Livewire Contributes:** If data displayed within Livewire components is not properly escaped, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. This is particularly relevant when rendering user-supplied data or data from untrusted sources within Livewire views.
- **Example:** A Livewire component displays a user's comment. If the comment contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` and is rendered without proper escaping, the script will execute in other users' browsers viewing that comment.
- **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use Blade's escaping features: Blade templates, used by Livewire, automatically escape output by default. Ensure you are not using the `!! !!` syntax for unescaped output unless absolutely necessary and you are certain the data is safe.
    - Sanitize user input: Sanitize user-provided data before displaying it in Livewire components. Use libraries like HTMLPurifier if necessary for more complex sanitization.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution or other security breaches.
- **How Livewire Contributes:** Livewire provides mechanisms for handling file uploads. If not implemented securely, this can introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Example:** A Livewire component allows users to upload profile pictures. If there are no restrictions on file types or size, an attacker could upload a PHP web shell, which they could then access to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Validate file types: Only allow specific, safe file types (e.g., images) based on their MIME type and/or file extension.
    - Validate file size: Limit the maximum file size that can be uploaded.
    - Sanitize filenames: Rename uploaded files to prevent path traversal or other filename-based attacks.
    - Store uploaded files outside the web root: Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible via a web browser.
    - Use a dedicated file storage service: Consider using services like Amazon S3 or Cloudinary for secure file storage and handling.

## Attack Surface: [CSRF Vulnerabilities in Livewire Actions (if default protection is disabled or bypassed)](./attack_surfaces/csrf_vulnerabilities_in_livewire_actions__if_default_protection_is_disabled_or_bypassed_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into making unintended requests to the application.
- **How Livewire Contributes:** While Livewire provides CSRF protection by default, if developers disable it or if there are vulnerabilities allowing bypass, Livewire actions become susceptible.
- **Example:** An attacker could create a malicious website with a form that submits to a Livewire action on the target application. If a logged-in user visits this malicious site, their browser could unknowingly send a request to the target application, performing an action on their behalf (e.g., changing their email address).
- **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim, data manipulation.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure CSRF protection is enabled: Do not disable Livewire's default CSRF protection.
    - Use `@csrf` directive in forms: Ensure all forms that trigger Livewire actions include the `@csrf` directive.
    - Verify CSRF tokens: Livewire automatically handles CSRF token verification. Ensure your application's middleware is configured correctly to handle CSRF protection.
