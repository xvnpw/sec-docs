## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Manipulate Data Sent to Server [CRITICAL]:** Attackers intercept and modify data sent from the client to the server via Livewire's data binding and action calls.
    *   **Property Binding Manipulation [CRITICAL]:** Livewire binds data between the client-side view and server-side component properties. Attackers can use browser developer tools to modify the values of these bound properties before they are sent to the server.
        *   **Inject malicious code into bound properties:** Injecting JavaScript or other code into properties that are later used in server-side rendering or processing, potentially leading to XSS or other vulnerabilities.
        *   **Execute arbitrary JavaScript on the server:** Successful injection of malicious code can lead to its execution within the server-side context.
        *   **Gain access to sensitive data or execute commands [CRITICAL]:** By manipulating properties that control access or trigger actions, attackers might bypass authorization checks or execute unintended server-side logic, leading to data breaches or command execution.
    *   **Action Parameter Tampering:** Livewire actions are triggered by client-side events. Attackers can modify the parameters sent with these actions, potentially bypassing validation or authorization checks.
        *   **Modify parameters of Livewire actions:** Intercepting and altering the data sent with action calls.
        *   **Bypass authorization checks:** By manipulating parameters, attackers might circumvent intended access controls.
    *   **File Upload Exploits (if Livewire handles uploads) [CRITICAL]:** If Livewire is used to handle file uploads, attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) to gain remote code execution or compromise the server.
        *   **Upload malicious files:** Submitting files containing malicious code.
        *   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]:** Successful upload and execution of malicious files can grant the attacker complete control over the server.
*   **Exploit Client-Side Rendering/Updates:** Livewire updates the DOM dynamically based on server-side changes. This process can be targeted for attacks.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Livewire Rendering [CRITICAL]:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize data before rendering it in Livewire components, attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the user's browser.
        *   **Inject malicious scripts through Livewire components:** Embedding malicious JavaScript within data that Livewire renders.
        *   **Steal user credentials or session tokens [CRITICAL]:** Successful XSS can allow attackers to steal sensitive information like login credentials or session identifiers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Specific to Livewire](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_specific_to_livewire.md)

*   **Insecure Component State Management [CRITICAL]:** Livewire manages the state of components on the server. Vulnerabilities in how this state is handled can be exploited.
    *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:** If Livewire components allow binding to properties that should be protected (e.g., `isAdmin`), attackers can manipulate client-side data to modify these properties, leading to privilege escalation.
        *   **Modify protected properties via data binding:**  Leveraging Livewire's data binding to alter server-side properties that should be restricted.
        *   **Elevate privileges or modify sensitive data [CRITICAL]:** Successfully exploiting mass assignment can grant attackers administrative rights or allow them to change critical data.
    *   **Insecure Session Handling with Livewire:** Vulnerabilities in how Livewire interacts with the application's session management can lead to session fixation or hijacking.
        *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in how Livewire interacts with sessions:** Targeting weaknesses in Livewire's session handling mechanisms.
        *   **Session fixation or hijacking [CRITICAL]:**  Gaining control of a user's session, allowing impersonation.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if Livewire uses serialization) [CRITICAL]:** If Livewire uses serialization for storing or transferring component state, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can allow attackers to inject malicious code and achieve remote code execution.
        *   **Inject malicious serialized data:** Providing crafted, malicious serialized data to the application.
        *   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]:** Successful exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities can grant the attacker complete control over the server.
*   **Insecure Action Handling [CRITICAL]:** Livewire actions are server-side methods triggered by client-side events.
    *   **Lack of Proper Authorization Checks in Actions:** If actions don't properly verify user permissions before executing, attackers can bypass authorization and access restricted functionality.
        *   **Access restricted functionality without proper permissions [CRITICAL]:** Executing actions that should be limited to authorized users.
    *   **Input Validation Failures in Actions:** If actions don't properly validate user input, attackers can inject malicious data, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection or command injection.
        *   **Inject malicious data into server-side logic:** Providing input that exploits weaknesses in server-side processing.
        *   **SQL Injection (if interacting with databases) [CRITICAL]:** Injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate or extract data from the database.
        *   **Command Injection [CRITICAL]:** Injecting commands that will be executed by the server's operating system.
