# Threat Model Analysis for livewire/livewire

## Threat: [Data Tampering in AJAX Requests](./threats/data_tampering_in_ajax_requests.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the AJAX request sent by Livewire containing component state updates or action triggers. They modify the request payload (e.g., changing input values, action parameters) before it reaches the server.
*   **Impact:**  The server processes the tampered data, leading to incorrect state updates, unauthorized actions being executed, or data corruption. For example, an attacker could change the quantity of an item in a shopping cart or trigger an action they are not authorized to perform.
*   **Affected Component:**  Livewire's request lifecycle, specifically the JavaScript that sends AJAX requests and the server-side handling of these requests (`Livewire\Component` base class and its methods).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always perform server-side validation on all data received from Livewire requests.
    *   Use Livewire's built-in validation features.
    *   Consider using signed routes or request signing for sensitive actions to verify the integrity of the request.
    *   Implement proper authorization checks on the server-side before processing any action.

## Threat: [Livewire Component Injection Leading to XSS](./threats/livewire_component_injection_leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker finds a way to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into a Livewire component's rendering process. This could happen if user input is directly used to determine which component to render or if component properties are not properly sanitized before being displayed.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:**  Livewire's component rendering engine, particularly when using dynamic components or displaying user-provided data within components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly using user input to determine component names or properties.
    *   Always sanitize user-provided data before displaying it in Livewire components. Use Blade's escaping features (`{{ }}`) by default.
    *   Be extremely cautious when using the `{!! !!}` syntax for unescaped output.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure Use of `wire:ignore` Leading to XSS](./threats/insecure_use_of__wireignore__leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Description:** A developer uses the `wire:ignore` directive to prevent Livewire from updating a specific DOM element. If this element contains unsanitized user input or content from an untrusted source, and Livewire doesn't update it, an XSS vulnerability can persist.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, as the unsanitized content remains in the DOM and can be exploited by attackers.
*   **Affected Component:**  The `wire:ignore` directive in Livewire's templating engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully consider the use of `wire:ignore`. Only use it when absolutely necessary.
    *   Ensure that any content within elements marked with `wire:ignore` is properly sanitized before the initial render.
    *   If the content within a `wire:ignore` element needs to be dynamic, find alternative solutions that allow Livewire to manage it securely.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities through Component Properties](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_through_component_properties.md)

*   **Description:** A Livewire component directly binds to an Eloquent model without proper protection (e.g., using `$fillable` or `$guarded`). An attacker could potentially modify unintended model attributes by including extra data in the AJAX request payload.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of database records, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of application state.
*   **Affected Component:**  Livewire's data binding mechanism between component properties and Eloquent models.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use the `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on your Eloquent models to explicitly define which attributes can be mass-assigned.
    *   Avoid directly binding public component properties to sensitive model attributes without careful consideration.
    *   Validate all incoming data from Livewire requests before updating models.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Component State](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_component_state.md)

*   **Description:** A developer stores sensitive information directly in the public properties of a Livewire component. This information can be exposed in the initial HTML source code or during AJAX requests.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive user data, API keys, or other confidential information.
*   **Affected Component:**  Livewire's component state management, specifically public properties.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in public component properties.
    *   Use protected or private properties for sensitive data and access them through controlled methods.
    *   Consider encrypting sensitive data before sending it to the client if absolutely necessary.

## Threat: [Insecure Authorization Checks within Component Actions](./threats/insecure_authorization_checks_within_component_actions.md)

*   **Description:** A developer implements insufficient or incorrect authorization checks within a Livewire component's action methods, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions they should not have access to.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to functionality, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:**  Livewire's action handling mechanism and the specific logic within component methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always implement robust authorization checks using Laravel's built-in features (e.g., policies, gates) within Livewire component methods.
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for authorization.
    *   Ensure that authorization checks are performed before any sensitive action is executed.
