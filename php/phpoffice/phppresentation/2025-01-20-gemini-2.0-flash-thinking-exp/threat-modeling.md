# Threat Model Analysis for phpoffice/phppresentation

## Threat: [Malicious Presentation File Processing - Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_presentation_file_processing_-_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability within PHPPresentation's file parsing logic allows an attacker to craft a malicious presentation file. When this file is processed by PHPPresentation, it triggers the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:**  PHPPresentation's file reader module (specifically components handling parsing of various presentation file formats like .pptx, .odp).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update PHPPresentation to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Run PHPPresentation processing in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions.
* Consider using a dedicated, hardened service for presentation processing.

## Threat: [Malicious Presentation File Processing - Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_presentation_file_processing_-_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in PHPPresentation's file parsing allows an attacker to create a specially crafted presentation file. When PHPPresentation attempts to process this file, it consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to application slowdown or complete service disruption.

**Impact:**  Application unavailability, impacting legitimate users. Potential server instability affecting other applications on the same server.

**Affected Component:** PHPPresentation's file reader module, particularly components responsible for parsing complex elements or large files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update PHPPresentation to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Set timeouts for PHPPresentation processing to prevent indefinite resource consumption.

## Threat: [Malicious Presentation File Processing - Information Disclosure](./threats/malicious_presentation_file_processing_-_information_disclosure.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability within PHPPresentation's file parsing logic allows an attacker to craft a presentation file that, when processed, causes the library to inadvertently reveal sensitive information from the server's file system or environment. This could occur through error messages or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how PHPPresentation handles external resources during parsing.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, configuration details, or internal file paths, which could be used for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** PHPPresentation's file reader module, potentially interacting with components handling external resources or error reporting.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update PHPPresentation to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Configure PHPPresentation to avoid accessing unnecessary external resources.
* Implement robust error handling within the application using PHPPresentation and avoid displaying verbose error messages to users.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** PHPPresentation relies on other PHP libraries for various functionalities (e.g., XML parsing, ZIP handling). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be directly exploitable through PHPPresentation's usage of them, leading to security breaches.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to RCE, DoS, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:**  The specific dependency with the vulnerability (e.g., a specific XML parsing library used by PHPPresentation).

**Risk Severity:**  Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability, including High and Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit and update all dependencies of PHPPresentation using a dependency management tool like Composer.
* Subscribe to security advisories for PHP and its common libraries.
* Consider using tools that scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
