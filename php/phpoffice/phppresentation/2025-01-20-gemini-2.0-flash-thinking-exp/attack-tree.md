## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents the broad category of attacks that target the way PHPPresentation reads and interprets presentation files. Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses in the parsing logic for different file formats (like .pptx, .odp, .ppt) to achieve various malicious outcomes, including code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [ZIP Archive Exploits (e.g., Zip Slip)](./attack_tree_paths/zip_archive_exploits__e_g___zip_slip_.md)

This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the handling of ZIP archives, which are the underlying structure for formats like .pptx and .odp. The "Zip Slip" vulnerability allows attackers to craft filenames within the archive that, when extracted, write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious executables.

## Attack Tree Path: [XML Parsing Vulnerabilities (XXE)](./attack_tree_paths/xml_parsing_vulnerabilities__xxe_.md)

This node highlights the risks associated with parsing XML data, which is prevalent within presentation file formats. XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious XML code that forces the server to access local files or make requests to external systems, potentially leading to information disclosure or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in External Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_external_libraries.md)

This critical node emphasizes the risk introduced by PHPPresentation's dependencies on other libraries for tasks like ZIP handling, XML parsing, and image processing. If these external libraries have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them indirectly through PHPPresentation by crafting specific presentation content that triggers the vulnerable code paths within those libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious files outside intended directory (via Zip Slip)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_files_outside_intended_directory__via_zip_slip_.md)

An attacker crafts a presentation file (e.g., .pptx, .odp) containing a ZIP archive with specially crafted filenames that include ".." sequences. When PHPPresentation extracts the archive, it is tricked into writing files outside the intended extraction directory, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious scripts in accessible locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject external entities to read local files or trigger SSRF (via XXE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_external_entities_to_read_local_files_or_trigger_ssrf__via_xxe_.md)

An attacker crafts a presentation file containing malicious XML code that defines external entities. When PHPPresentation parses this XML, it attempts to resolve these entities, potentially leading to the server reading local files (information disclosure) or making requests to attacker-controlled external servers (SSRF).

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger memory corruption leading to code execution (via format-specific parsing weaknesses)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_corruption_leading_to_code_execution__via_format-specific_parsing_weaknesses_.md)

An attacker crafts a presentation file in an older format (e.g., .ppt) that exploits specific parsing vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows. When PHPPresentation attempts to parse this malformed file, it can lead to memory corruption, which the attacker can manipulate to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite critical application files (via Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_critical_application_files__via_path_traversal_.md)

An attacker embeds malicious path sequences within the presentation file's internal structure (e.g., in image references or embedded file paths). When PHPPresentation processes these paths, it attempts to access or write files outside the intended directory, potentially overwriting critical application files and causing significant damage or enabling further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read sensitive configuration files (via Path Traversal)](./attack_tree_paths/read_sensitive_configuration_files__via_path_traversal_.md)

Similar to the previous path, an attacker embeds malicious path sequences to target sensitive configuration files. If successful, the attacker can gain access to credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information that can be used to further compromise the application or its environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve code execution through memory corruption (via image parsing vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_execution_through_memory_corruption__via_image_parsing_vulnerabilities_.md)

An attacker embeds a specially crafted image within the presentation file that exploits vulnerabilities in the image processing library used by PHPPresentation. When the library attempts to process this malicious image, it can lead to memory corruption, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger vulnerable code paths through specific presentation content (in external libraries)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerable_code_paths_through_specific_presentation_content__in_external_libraries_.md)

An attacker crafts a presentation file with specific content designed to trigger known vulnerabilities in the external libraries used by PHPPresentation (e.g., a specially crafted ZIP archive to exploit a vulnerability in the ZIP library). This can lead to various outcomes, including code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code within formula fields that gets executed during processing](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_within_formula_fields_that_gets_executed_during_processing.md)

If PHPPresentation supports formula fields within presentations and these fields are not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., PHP code) into these fields. When the application processes the presentation, this injected code can be executed on the server, leading to a complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Embed links to internal resources or external malicious servers that are accessed by the server during processing (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/embed_links_to_internal_resources_or_external_malicious_servers_that_are_accessed_by_the_server_duri_3557f795.md)

An attacker embeds malicious links within the presentation file, pointing to internal resources or external servers under their control. When PHPPresentation processes the presentation and attempts to access these linked resources (e.g., for displaying remote images), it can be tricked into making requests on behalf of the server. This can be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or interact with external malicious servers.
