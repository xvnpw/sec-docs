# Attack Surface Analysis for phpoffice/phppresentation

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Presentation File Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_presentation_file_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** The PHPPresentation library needs to parse complex file formats like `.pptx` and `.odp`. Maliciously crafted files can exploit vulnerabilities *within PHPPresentation's parsing logic*.
    *   **How PHPPresentation Contributes:** The library's core functionality is to read and interpret these file formats, making *its own parsing implementation* the direct handler of potentially malicious input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted `.pptx` file that contains an unexpected data structure. When *PHPPresentation's parsing routines* attempt to process this structure, it triggers a buffer overflow, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the overflow can be controlled.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the PHPPresentation library updated to the latest stable version. Updates often include fixes for *parsing vulnerabilities within the library itself*.
        *   Implement strict file size limits for uploaded presentation files as a general preventative measure.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment to process untrusted presentation files, limiting the impact of potential exploits *within PHPPresentation*.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Presentation files often contain images. If *PHPPresentation's image handling* relies on vulnerable underlying libraries (either directly or indirectly), malicious images embedded in presentations can exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   **How PHPPresentation Contributes:** The library handles the inclusion and potentially the rendering or manipulation of images within presentations, *making its interaction with image processing libraries a point of vulnerability*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker embeds a specially crafted image (e.g., a malicious JPEG or PNG) within a `.pptx` file. When *PHPPresentation processes this file and interacts with the image*, the underlying image library has a vulnerability that allows for code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service, potential Remote Code Execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the server environment has the latest versions of image processing libraries (e.g., GD, Imagick) with known vulnerabilities patched. *While not directly PHPPresentation code, its reliance on these makes it relevant*.
        *   Consider disabling or limiting image processing features *within the application's use of PHPPresentation* if they are not strictly necessary.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Presentation file formats like `.pptx` are essentially zipped archives containing XML files. If *PHPPresentation's XML parsing* is not configured securely, attackers can embed malicious external entity references within these XML files to access local files or internal network resources.
    *   **How PHPPresentation Contributes:** The library parses the XML structure within the presentation files. *The way PHPPresentation initializes and uses the XML parser* determines if it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a `.pptx` file containing a malicious XML payload that, when parsed by *PHPPresentation's XML parsing component*, reads the contents of `/etc/passwd` on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (reading local files), potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if external entities point to internal network resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the XML parser *used by PHPPresentation* to disable the processing of external entities. This is often a configuration option within the XML parsing library itself.
        *   Sanitize or escape any data extracted from the presentation files *by PHPPresentation* before using it in other parts of the application.

## Attack Surface: [Zip Slip Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/zip_slip_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Presentation files are often compressed archives (like ZIP). If *PHPPresentation's archive extraction* doesn't properly sanitize file paths, an attacker can craft a malicious archive that, when extracted, writes files to arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem.
    *   **How PHPPresentation Contributes:** The library handles the decompression and extraction of the contents of presentation files. *The security of its extraction process is the key factor.*
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates a malicious `.pptx` file where the internal file paths are crafted to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../`). When *PHPPresentation extracts this archive*, it overwrites critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary File Write, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution or Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   When extracting files from the presentation archive *within PHPPresentation*, strictly validate and sanitize the file paths to ensure they remain within the intended extraction directory.
        *   Use secure archive extraction libraries *that PHPPresentation might rely on* and ensure they are up-to-date.
