# Threat Model Analysis for phpoffice/phppresentation

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload - Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_file_upload_-_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted presentation file exploiting a vulnerability *within PHPPresentation's* parsing logic. This could involve buffer overflows, insecure deserialization, or other code execution flaws *in the PHPPresentation code*. Upon processing the file (e.g., using `IOFactory::load()`), the malicious code embedded within the file is executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server. Attacker can execute arbitrary commands, steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Affected Component:** Primarily the parsing components, especially within `IOFactory::load()` and format-specific readers (e.g., `Reader\PPTX`, `Reader\ODP`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation on uploaded files, verifying file type and potentially using a dedicated sanitization library *before* processing with PHPPresentation.
    *   Keep PHPPresentation updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Run the PHP process responsible for processing presentations in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools on the application code that interacts with PHPPresentation.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload - Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_file_upload_-_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted presentation file designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory) when processed *by PHPPresentation*. This could involve extremely large files, deeply nested structures, or other resource-intensive elements that overwhelm *PHPPresentation's processing capabilities*.
*   **Impact:** The server becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
*   **Affected Component:** Primarily the parsing components within `IOFactory::load()` and format-specific readers, as well as potentially components involved in rendering or processing complex elements *within PHPPresentation*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement file size limits for uploaded presentation files.
    *   Set resource limits (memory limit, execution time limit) for the PHP process handling file processing.
    *   Implement timeouts for file processing operations.
    *   Consider using a queue system to process files asynchronously, preventing a single malicious file from bringing down the entire application.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted presentation file containing malicious XML that exploits vulnerabilities *in PHPPresentation's* XML parsing. This allows the attacker to potentially read local files on the server or interact with internal network resources *through PHPPresentation's processing of the XML*.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), potential access to internal systems, and potentially denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Components involved in parsing XML within presentation files, potentially within format-specific readers (e.g., related to DOCX or PPTX formats which are based on XML).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that the XML parsing libraries *used by PHPPresentation* (or PHP's built-in XML functions *as used by PHPPresentation*) are configured to disable external entity resolution by default.
    *   Sanitize or validate the XML content within uploaded presentation files *before processing by PHPPresentation*.
    *   Keep PHPPresentation updated, as vulnerabilities related to XML parsing are often patched.
