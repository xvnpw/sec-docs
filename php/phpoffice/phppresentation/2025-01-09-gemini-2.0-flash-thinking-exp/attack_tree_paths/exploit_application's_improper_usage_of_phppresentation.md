Deep Analysis: Exploit Application's Improper Usage of PHPPresentation

This analysis delves into the attack tree path "Exploit Application's Improper Usage of PHPPresentation,"
focusing on the security implications of developers not adequately validating and sanitizing
user-provided data before it interacts with the PHPPresentation library. This oversight can
create significant vulnerabilities, paving the way for various injection attacks.
