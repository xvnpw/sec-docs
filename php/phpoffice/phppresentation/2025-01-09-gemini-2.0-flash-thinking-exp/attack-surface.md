# Attack Surface Analysis for phpoffice/phppresentation

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Presentation File Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_presentation_file_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** The library parses complex presentation file formats (e.g., PPTX). Maliciously crafted files with unexpected structures or invalid data can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
*   **How PHPPresentation Contributes:** The core functionality of the library is to parse and process these file formats, making it directly responsible for handling potentially malicious input.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted PPTX file with an excessively deep level of nested elements could cause the parser to consume excessive memory, potentially leading to memory corruption or even allowing for arbitrary code execution in vulnerable versions.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential for memory corruption leading to unexpected behavior or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `phpoffice/phppresentation` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Implement strict file size limits for uploaded presentation files.
    *   Consider using a dedicated, isolated environment (e.g., a sandbox or container) to process potentially untrusted presentation files.
    *   Implement resource limits (memory, CPU time) for the PHP processes handling presentation parsing.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Modern presentation formats (like PPTX) are based on XML. If the underlying XML parsing within `phpoffice/phppresentation` is not configured to prevent external entity processing, attackers can include malicious external entities in presentation files.
*   **How PHPPresentation Contributes:** If the library uses a vulnerable XML parser and doesn't disable external entity resolution, it becomes susceptible to XXE attacks when processing malicious presentation files.
*   **Example:** A malicious PPTX file could contain an external entity definition that attempts to read local files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading local files), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that the underlying XML parser used by `phpoffice/phppresentation` (if configurable) has external entity processing disabled by default or is explicitly disabled in the application's configuration.
    *   Keep `phpoffice/phppresentation` updated, as newer versions may have addressed XXE vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Zip Slip Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/zip_slip_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Presentation files are often packaged as ZIP archives. If `phpoffice/phppresentation` doesn't properly sanitize file paths when extracting embedded resources from these archives, an attacker can craft a malicious archive that, when extracted, writes files to arbitrary locations on the server.
*   **How PHPPresentation Contributes:** The library handles the extraction of content from the ZIP archives of presentation files. If this extraction process doesn't validate and sanitize file paths, it introduces the risk of Zip Slip.
*   **Example:** A malicious PPTX file could contain a file with a path like `../../../etc/passwd`, which, if extracted without proper validation, could overwrite the system's password file.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) through file overwrite, denial of service by overwriting critical system files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that `phpoffice/phppresentation` and any underlying ZIP extraction libraries it uses are updated to versions that mitigate Zip Slip vulnerabilities.
    *   When extracting files from the presentation archive, strictly validate and sanitize the target file paths to ensure they remain within the intended extraction directory.

## Attack Surface: [Handling of Malicious Embedded Objects/Media](./attack_surfaces/handling_of_malicious_embedded_objectsmedia.md)

*   **Description:** Presentations can contain embedded objects (e.g., OLE objects, other file types) or media (images, videos). If `phpoffice/phppresentation` processes or renders these without proper checks, malicious content could be executed or trigger vulnerabilities in underlying processing libraries.
*   **How PHPPresentation Contributes:** The library is responsible for accessing and potentially processing these embedded elements. If it doesn't properly sanitize or isolate this processing, it can expose the application to risks.
*   **Example:** A malicious presentation could embed a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image processing library used by `phpoffice/phppresentation`, leading to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `phpoffice/phppresentation` and any of its image/media processing dependencies updated.
    *   If possible, avoid automatically processing or rendering embedded objects from untrusted sources.
    *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for processing embedded content.
