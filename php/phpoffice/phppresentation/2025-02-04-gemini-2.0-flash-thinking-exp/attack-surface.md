# Attack Surface Analysis for phpoffice/phppresentation

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Presentation File Upload (Parsing Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_presentation_file_upload__parsing_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:**  The application allows users to upload presentation files processed by `phpoffice/phppresentation`. A malicious file can exploit parsing vulnerabilities within the library itself.
*   **phppresentation Contribution:** `phpoffice/phppresentation` is directly responsible for parsing complex presentation file formats. Vulnerabilities in its parsing logic create a direct pathway for exploitation.
*   **Example:** Uploading a crafted PPTX file that, when parsed by `phpoffice/phppresentation`, triggers a buffer overflow, leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Complete server compromise.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Application becomes unavailable.
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Potential access to internal networks.
    *   Information Disclosure - Leakage of sensitive server-side data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate file extensions and MIME types. Implement file size limits.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Process file parsing in isolated environments (containers, sandboxes) to limit exploit impact.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `phpoffice/phppresentation` and dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan `phpoffice/phppresentation` and dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [File Format Vulnerabilities (Parsing Logic Flaws)](./attack_surfaces/file_format_vulnerabilities__parsing_logic_flaws_.md)

*   **Description:** Presentation file formats are intricate.  Flaws in `phpoffice/phppresentation`'s parsing implementation for specific file structures can be exploited.
*   **phppresentation Contribution:** The core function of `phpoffice/phppresentation` is parsing these complex formats.  Parsing logic vulnerabilities are inherent to the library's operation.
*   **Example:** A PPTX file with a malformed XML structure triggers an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in `phpoffice/phppresentation`'s XML parsing, allowing an attacker to read local files on the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure - Reading sensitive server files.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Application crash due to parsing errors.
    *   Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Depending on vulnerability specifics.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on vulnerability type and exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure XML Parsing Configuration:** Securely configure XML parsing libraries used by `phpoffice/phppresentation`, disabling external entity resolution if unnecessary.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `phpoffice/phppresentation` updated for parsing logic bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing:** Conduct thorough fuzzing and security testing of file parsing with malformed and edge-case files.
    *   **Code Audits:** Perform code audits of `phpoffice/phppresentation`'s parsing logic to identify potential flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) through File Processing](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__dos__through_file_processing.md)

*   **Description:** Processing large or complex presentation files using `phpoffice/phppresentation` can consume excessive server resources, leading to Denial of Service.
*   **phppresentation Contribution:** `phpoffice/phppresentation` performs the resource-intensive task of file parsing and manipulation. Inefficient processing or lack of resource limits when using the library directly contributes to this risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly uploads very large PPTX files or files with numerous slides and complex elements. `phpoffice/phppresentation`'s processing of these files exhausts server CPU and memory, causing application unresponsiveness.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Application becomes unavailable or severely degraded for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement PHP resource limits (memory, execution time) for file processing.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limits on file upload and processing endpoints to prevent abuse.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload file processing to background queues to prevent blocking the main application thread.
    *   **File Size and Complexity Limits:** Enforce reasonable file size limits and potentially limits on presentation complexity.
