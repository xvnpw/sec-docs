## Attack Tree Path: [[1.0] Exploit File Parsing Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_0__exploit_file_parsing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how PHPPresentation parses presentation file formats, particularly XML-based formats.
*   **Potential Impact:** Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, potentially Remote Code Execution (though less likely for buffer overflows in this context, XXE is more probable).

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1] XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1__xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** If PHPPresentation uses an XML parser that is not securely configured, it might be vulnerable to XXE injection. This allows an attacker to include external entities in a malicious presentation file.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **[1.1.3.a] Read server-side files (e.g., configuration, source code) (High-Risk Path):** Attacker can read local files on the server by defining an external entity pointing to the file path. This can expose sensitive configuration files, source code, or other internal data.
    *   **[1.1.3.b] Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High-Risk Path):** Attacker can make the server initiate requests to internal or external systems by defining an external entity pointing to a URL. This can be used to probe internal networks or interact with internal services.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] [1.1.1.a] Upload/Process malicious file via application:** This is the entry point where the attacker uploads a malicious presentation file containing the XXE payload.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] [1.1.2] Trigger PHPPresentation to parse malicious XML:** This is the step where PHPPresentation's vulnerable XML parsing functionality is triggered by the malicious file, leading to the XXE injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.3.a] Read server-side files (e.g., configuration, source code) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_3_a__read_server-side_files__e_g___configuration__source_code___high-risk_path_.md)

Attacker can read local files on the server by defining an external entity pointing to the file path. This can expose sensitive configuration files, source code, or other internal data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.3.b] Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_3_b__perform_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___high-risk_path_.md)

Attacker can make the server initiate requests to internal or external systems by defining an external entity pointing to a URL. This can be used to probe internal networks or interact with internal services.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3] Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** PHPPresentation might be vulnerable to DoS attacks if it can be forced to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, I/O) when parsing specially crafted presentation files.
*   **Potential Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption for legitimate users.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] [1.3.1.a] Upload/Process malicious file via application:**  The attacker uploads a specially crafted presentation file designed to consume excessive resources during parsing.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] [1.3.2] Trigger PHPPresentation to parse file leading to high resource consumption:** PHPPresentation's parsing process becomes resource-intensive due to the malicious file, leading to DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.0] Exploit File Upload/Processing Vulnerabilities (Application Level, leveraging PHPPresentation) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_2_0__exploit_file_uploadprocessing_vulnerabilities__application_level__leveraging_phppresentation___fe501b82.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the *application* handles file uploads and processes files using PHPPresentation, rather than vulnerabilities within PHPPresentation's code itself.
*   **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Arbitrary File Read/Write, Application Compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1] Malicious File Upload leading to RCE (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1__malicious_file_upload_leading_to_rce__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** If the application allows file uploads without proper validation and subsequently processes these files in a way that can lead to code execution, an attacker can upload a malicious file disguised as a presentation file.
*   **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution, full control over the server.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] [2.1.1.a] Application allows file uploads without proper validation:** This is a critical application-level vulnerability – lack of proper file type and content validation on uploads.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] [2.1.2] Application processes the uploaded file using PHPPresentation and executes embedded code:** This highlights a vulnerability in the application's file handling logic after PHPPresentation processing, potentially leading to execution of malicious code.
    *   **[2.1.3] Gain shell access or control over the server (High-Risk Path):**  The ultimate goal of RCE, achieving full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.2] Path Traversal via Filename Manipulation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_2_2__path_traversal_via_filename_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** If the application or PHPPresentation extracts filenames or paths from within presentation files and uses them without proper sanitization, an attacker can craft a presentation file with malicious filenames containing path traversal sequences.
*   **Potential Impact:** Arbitrary File Read/Write, potentially leading to access to sensitive data or modification of critical application files.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] [2.2.1.a] Application uses filenames from presentation file without sanitization:** This is a critical application-level vulnerability – lack of sanitization of filenames extracted from presentation files.
    *   **[2.2.3] Read or write arbitrary files on the server (High-Risk Path):** The attacker's goal of exploiting path traversal to access or modify files outside the intended application directory.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.0] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_3_0__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries that PHPPresentation depends on.
*   **Potential Impact:** Depends on the specific dependency vulnerability - could be Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure, etc.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] [3.2.1.a] Craft specific presentation file or input to trigger vulnerability:** This is the crucial step where the attacker crafts a presentation file designed to trigger a known vulnerability in one of PHPPresentation's dependencies *through* PHPPresentation's usage of that dependency.
