# Deep Analysis of PHPPresentation Attack Tree Path: File Format Parsing Vulnerabilities

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack tree path related to "Vulnerability in File Format Parsing" within the context of the PHPPresentation library.  This analysis aims to:

*   Identify specific, actionable attack vectors related to PPTX, ODP, and ZIP parsing.
*   Assess the real-world exploitability of these vulnerabilities.
*   Propose concrete, prioritized mitigation strategies beyond the high-level suggestions in the original attack tree.
*   Provide guidance for the development team on how to proactively address these vulnerabilities during development and testing.
*   Identify potential security issues in the code.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

**Vulnerability in File Format Parsing**  ->  **PPTX** / **ODP** / **ZIP**

We will consider:

*   The PHPPresentation library's code (available at [https://github.com/phpoffice/phppresentation](https://github.com/phpoffice/phppresentation)).
*   Known vulnerabilities in similar libraries or file format parsing in general.
*   Common attack techniques related to XML parsing and ZIP archive handling.
*   The dependencies used by PHPPresentation for file format parsing (e.g., XML parsers, ZIP libraries).

We will *not* consider:

*   Vulnerabilities outside of file format parsing (e.g., SQL injection, XSS in the web application using PHPPresentation).  These are separate attack tree branches.
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks that simply cause the application to crash without leading to code execution or data exfiltration (although parsing vulnerabilities *can* lead to DoS, our focus is on more severe consequences).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the relevant parts of the PHPPresentation codebase, focusing on the classes and methods responsible for:
    *   Opening and reading ZIP archives.
    *   Parsing XML content within PPTX and ODP files.
    *   Handling embedded objects and external references.
    *   Extracting files from the archive.

2.  **Dependency Analysis:** We will identify the specific libraries used by PHPPresentation for XML parsing and ZIP handling.  We will then research known vulnerabilities in these dependencies and assess their versions.

3.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities related to:
    *   XML parsing (XXE, XSLT injection, billion laughs attack, etc.).
    *   ZIP archive handling (Zip Slip, path traversal).
    *   File format-specific vulnerabilities in PPTX and ODP.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will construct realistic attack scenarios based on the identified vulnerabilities and the capabilities of PHPPresentation.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will provide specific, prioritized mitigation strategies, including code changes, configuration recommendations, and testing procedures.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 4.1. ZIP (Likelihood: High, Impact: Very High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Advanced, Detection Difficulty: Hard)

**Description:**  The core vulnerability here is **Zip Slip** (and related path traversal issues).  PHPPresentation, like many libraries dealing with presentations, relies on the ZIP format.  A maliciously crafted PPTX or ODP file could contain filenames with relative path components (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) designed to overwrite critical system files or place malicious files in unexpected locations when extracted.

**Code Review Focus:**

*   Examine `src/PhpPresentation/Reader/`.  Look for any code that handles file extraction from ZIP archives.  Specifically, look for:
    *   Use of `ZipArchive` class (PHP's built-in ZIP handling).
    *   Any custom logic for constructing file paths during extraction.
    *   Lack of sanitization or validation of filenames extracted from the archive.
    *   Lack of checks to ensure extracted files remain within the intended target directory.

**Dependency Analysis:**

*   PHPPresentation uses PHP's built-in `ZipArchive` class. While `ZipArchive` itself isn't inherently vulnerable to Zip Slip, *how it's used* is crucial.  The vulnerability lies in the application code not properly validating filenames before extraction.

**Vulnerability Research:**

*   **Zip Slip:**  This is a well-documented vulnerability.  Numerous examples and proof-of-concept exploits exist.  (Snyk has excellent resources on Zip Slip).
*   **Path Traversal:**  Similar to Zip Slip, but may not involve a ZIP archive.  The principle is the same: manipulating file paths to access unauthorized locations.

**Threat Modeling:**

1.  **Scenario 1: Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker uploads a malicious PPTX file containing a file named `../../../../var/www/html/index.php`.  If PHPPresentation extracts this file without proper validation, it could overwrite the application's main file, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code.

2.  **Scenario 2:  .htaccess Overwrite:**  An attacker could overwrite the `.htaccess` file in a web server's document root, potentially disabling security restrictions or redirecting traffic.

3.  **Scenario 3:  Configuration File Modification:**  An attacker could target configuration files (e.g., database credentials) to gain access to sensitive data.

**Mitigation Strategies (Prioritized):**

1.  **Path Sanitization (Highest Priority):**  Before extracting *any* file from the ZIP archive, *absolutely sanitize* the filename.  This involves:
    *   Removing any leading or trailing slashes.
    *   Removing any occurrences of `../` or `..\`.
    *   Replacing any invalid characters (e.g., control characters, characters not allowed in filenames).
    *   Using a whitelist of allowed characters if possible.
    *   PHP example:
        ```php
        function sanitizeFilename($filename) {
            $filename = trim($filename, '/');
            $filename = str_replace(['../', '..\\'], '', $filename);
            // Add more sanitization as needed
            return $filename;
        }
        ```

2.  **Canonicalization (High Priority):** After sanitization, resolve the absolute path of the intended extraction directory and the absolute path of the file to be extracted.  Ensure that the extracted file's path *starts with* the extraction directory's path.  This prevents any remaining path traversal attempts.
    ```php
    $targetDir = realpath('/path/to/extraction/directory');
    $filePath = realpath($targetDir . '/' . sanitizeFilename($zipEntry->getName()));

    if (strpos($filePath, $targetDir) !== 0) {
        // Path traversal detected!  Throw an exception or handle the error.
        throw new Exception("Invalid file path detected.");
    }
    ```

3.  **Least Privilege (Medium Priority):**  Run the PHP process with the *minimum necessary privileges*.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve file overwrite.  Avoid running as root or a highly privileged user.

4.  **Regular Expression Validation (Medium Priority):** Use a regular expression to enforce a strict format for filenames within the ZIP archive.  This can be more robust than simple string replacement.

5.  **Testing (High Priority):**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Create unit tests that specifically attempt to exploit Zip Slip vulnerabilities with crafted ZIP files.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use a fuzzer to generate malformed ZIP archives and test PHPPresentation's handling of them.

### 4.2. PPTX and ODP (Likelihood: High, Impact: Very High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Advanced, Detection Difficulty: Hard)

**Description:**  Both PPTX and ODP are XML-based formats.  This opens up a range of XML-related vulnerabilities.  The complexity of these formats also increases the likelihood of parsing errors.

**Code Review Focus:**

*   Examine `src/PhpPresentation/Reader/`.  Look for code that parses XML:
    *   Identify the XML parser used (e.g., `DOMDocument`, `SimpleXML`, `XMLReader`).
    *   Check for proper handling of external entities (XXE).
    *   Check for safe handling of XSLT transformations (if used).
    *   Look for any custom XML parsing logic that might be vulnerable.
    *   Check how embedded objects and external resources are handled.

**Dependency Analysis:**

*   PHPPresentation likely uses PHP's built-in XML extensions (`DOMDocument`, `SimpleXML`, `XMLReader`).  These extensions are generally secure *if used correctly*.  The key is to disable features that can be exploited.

**Vulnerability Research:**

*   **XXE (XML External Entity Injection):**  This is a major vulnerability where an attacker can include external entities in an XML document, potentially leading to:
    *   Local file disclosure (reading arbitrary files on the server).
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (making the server send requests to other systems).
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **XSLT Injection:** If PHPPresentation uses XSLT transformations, an attacker could inject malicious XSLT code, leading to similar vulnerabilities as XXE.
*   **Billion Laughs Attack (XML Bomb):**  A specially crafted XML document with nested entities can cause exponential expansion, leading to a denial-of-service attack.
*   **Schema Validation Bypass:** If XML schema validation is used, attackers might try to bypass it with malformed XML that still gets parsed.
*   **Embedded Object Handling:**  Vulnerabilities can arise from how PHPPresentation handles embedded objects (e.g., images, videos, other documents) within PPTX and ODP files.  These objects might be processed by other libraries, introducing further vulnerabilities.

**Threat Modeling:**

1.  **Scenario 1: XXE - File Disclosure:** An attacker uploads a PPTX file containing an XML payload that defines an external entity pointing to `/etc/passwd`.  If PHPPresentation doesn't disable external entity loading, the contents of `/etc/passwd` could be included in the parsed XML and potentially exposed to the attacker.

2.  **Scenario 2: XXE - SSRF:**  An attacker uses XXE to make the server send HTTP requests to internal systems, potentially accessing sensitive data or services.

3.  **Scenario 3:  Embedded Object Exploitation:**  An attacker embeds a malicious image file within a PPTX.  If the image parsing library has a vulnerability, processing this image could lead to code execution.

**Mitigation Strategies (Prioritized):**

1.  **Disable External Entities (Highest Priority):**  When using PHP's XML parsers, explicitly disable external entity loading.  This is the most crucial step to prevent XXE.
    ```php
    // For DOMDocument:
    $dom = new DOMDocument();
    $dom->loadXML($xmlData, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD | LIBXML_NONET);

    // For SimpleXML:
    $xml = simplexml_load_string($xmlData, 'SimpleXMLElement', LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD | LIBXML_NONET);

    //For XMLReader
    $reader = new XMLReader();
    $reader->XML($xml, NULL, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD | LIBXML_NONET);
    ```
    `LIBXML_NOENT`: Disable entity substitution.
    `LIBXML_DTDLOAD`: Disable loading of external DTDs.
    `LIBXML_NONET`: Disable network access when loading documents.

2.  **Disable DTD Loading (High Priority):**  Even if external entities are disabled, loading DTDs can still pose risks.  Disable DTD loading as shown above.

3.  **Use a Safe XML Parser Configuration (High Priority):**  Ensure that the XML parser is configured securely, with all potentially dangerous features disabled.

4.  **Validate XML Against a Schema (Medium Priority):**  If possible, validate the XML content of PPTX and ODP files against a known, strict schema.  This can help detect malformed or unexpected XML structures.  However, be aware of schema validation bypass techniques.

5.  **Sanitize Input (Medium Priority):**  Before passing any data to the XML parser, sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters or sequences.

6.  **Handle Embedded Objects Securely (Medium Priority):**  If PHPPresentation processes embedded objects, ensure that:
    *   The libraries used to handle these objects are up-to-date and secure.
    *   Input validation is performed on the embedded objects.
    *   Objects are processed in a sandboxed environment if possible.

7.  **Testing (High Priority):**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Create unit tests that specifically attempt to exploit XXE and other XML vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use a fuzzer to generate malformed XML and test PHPPresentation's handling of it.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.
