# Threat Model Analysis for phpoffice/phpspreadsheet

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted spreadsheet file that exploits a vulnerability in PHPSpreadsheet's parsing logic. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how the library handles specific file formats, embedded objects, or external references. Upon processing the file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Affected Component:**  File Reader (e.g., `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Xlsx`, `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Xls`), potentially related to handling external references or embedded objects.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation on the server-side, only allowing expected spreadsheet formats.
    *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided data that influences file processing.
    *   Run PHPSpreadsheet operations in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
    *   Keep PHPSpreadsheet updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a dedicated service for file processing that is isolated from the main application.

## Threat: [Formula Injection leading to Information Disclosure or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/formula_injection_leading_to_information_disclosure_or_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious formulas into spreadsheet cells. When PHPSpreadsheet processes these formulas, they could be used to access local files on the server (information disclosure) or make requests to internal or external resources (SSRF), potentially exposing sensitive information or compromising internal systems.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive server-side files or internal network information. Potential for further attacks through SSRF.
*   **Affected Component:** Formula Calculation Engine (`\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Calculation\Calculation`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable or restrict the use of dynamic formulas if they are not strictly necessary for the application's functionality.
    *   Sanitize and validate data extracted from spreadsheets before using it in critical operations.
    *   Configure PHPSpreadsheet to disallow external data sources in formulas if not required.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of potential SSRF attacks.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a spreadsheet file (e.g., XLSX) containing malicious XML that exploits vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet's XML parsing. This allows the attacker to access local files on the server, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive files from the server's file system.
*   **Affected Component:** XML Reader (used internally by format-specific readers like `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Xlsx`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that PHP's XML processing libraries (like `libxml`) are configured to disable external entity loading by default.
    *   Consider using PHPSpreadsheet's options (if available) to disable external entity loading during XML parsing.
    *   Keep PHP and its XML extensions updated.
