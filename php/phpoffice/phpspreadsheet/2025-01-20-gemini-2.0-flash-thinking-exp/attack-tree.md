## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Compromise via PHP Code Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_compromise_via_php_code_injection.md)

* **Compromise Application via PHPSpreadsheet:** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit File Parsing Vulnerabilities:** The attacker targets weaknesses in how PHPSpreadsheet processes spreadsheet files.
* **Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet File Uploaded/Processed (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker successfully uploads or has the application process a specially crafted spreadsheet.
* **Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):** The malicious spreadsheet leverages a vulnerability allowing the injection of executable code.
* **Inject PHP Code via Formulae/Cell Content (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker embeds malicious PHP code within spreadsheet formulas or cell content.
    * **Leverage Dynamic Formula Evaluation (e.g., `EVAL`, custom functions):** The attacker exploits features where PHPSpreadsheet or the application evaluates formulas or custom functions dynamically, leading to the execution of the injected PHP code. This could involve using built-in functions like `EVAL` (if exposed) or exploiting custom function handling within the application's integration with PHPSpreadsheet.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Compromise via XML External Entity (XXE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_compromise_via_xml_external_entity__xxe_.md)

* **Compromise Application via PHPSpreadsheet:** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit File Parsing Vulnerabilities:** The attacker targets weaknesses in how PHPSpreadsheet processes spreadsheet files.
* **Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet File Uploaded/Processed (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker successfully uploads or has the application process a specially crafted spreadsheet.
* **Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker leverages the XML structure of modern spreadsheet formats (like XLSX) to inject malicious external entities.
    * **Embed Malicious External Entities in Spreadsheet XML:** The attacker crafts the spreadsheet's underlying XML files to include references to external entities.
        * **Target XML Parsing Libraries Used by PHPSpreadsheet:** When PHPSpreadsheet parses the XML, it attempts to resolve these external entities. A vulnerable configuration or library allows the attacker to force the server to access arbitrary local files (information disclosure) or even execute code on the server (if combined with other vulnerabilities).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Compromise via XML Bomb (Billion Laughs)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_compromise_via_xml_bomb__billion_laughs_.md)

* **Compromise Application via PHPSpreadsheet:** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit File Parsing Vulnerabilities:** The attacker targets weaknesses in how PHPSpreadsheet processes spreadsheet files.
* **Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet File Uploaded/Processed (CRITICAL NODE):** The attacker successfully uploads or has the application process a specially crafted spreadsheet.
* **Trigger Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker aims to disrupt the application's availability.
    * **Exploit Billion Laughs Attack (XML Bomb):** The attacker utilizes the XML structure of the spreadsheet to create a recursive entity definition.
        * **Leverage Recursive Entity Definitions in Spreadsheet XML:** The attacker crafts the XML in a way that causes exponential expansion of entities during parsing, rapidly consuming server resources (CPU and memory) and leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Compromise via Processing Untrusted Files](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_compromise_via_processing_untrusted_files.md)

* **Compromise Application via PHPSpreadsheet:** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Processing Untrusted Spreadsheet Files (CRITICAL NODE):** The application directly processes spreadsheet files provided by users or external sources without proper security measures.
    * **Rely on User-Provided Spreadsheets Without Sanitization:** The application trusts the content and structure of the uploaded spreadsheet.
        * **Lack of Input Validation on Spreadsheet Content and Structure:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the data and structure of the spreadsheet, making it susceptible to various file parsing vulnerabilities (as detailed in other paths). This node acts as a gateway to many potential exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Use Outdated or Vulnerable Versions of PHPSpreadsheet](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_use_outdated_or_vulnerable_versions_of_phpspreadsheet.md)

* **Compromise Application via PHPSpreadsheet:** The attacker's ultimate goal.
* **Exploit Configuration Issues:** The attacker targets misconfigurations in the application's setup.
* **Insecure PHPSpreadsheet Configuration:** The application's PHPSpreadsheet setup is not secure.
    * **Use Outdated or Vulnerable Versions of PHPSpreadsheet (CRITICAL NODE):** The application uses an old version of PHPSpreadsheet that contains known security vulnerabilities.
        * **Lack of Regular Updates and Patching:** The application developers fail to keep PHPSpreadsheet updated with the latest security patches, leaving known vulnerabilities exploitable. This significantly increases the likelihood of successful attacks across various vectors.
