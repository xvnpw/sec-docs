*   **Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet Files**
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted spreadsheet file (e.g., XLSX, XLS, CSV, ODS) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in PhpSpreadsheet's parsing logic.
    *   **How PhpSpreadsheet Contributes:** PhpSpreadsheet is responsible for parsing and interpreting the structure and content of various spreadsheet file formats. Weaknesses in this parsing logic can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted XLSX file with an overly deep XML structure that causes excessive memory consumption during parsing, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure, Server Resource Exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation on upload.
        *   Set resource limits (memory, execution time) for PhpSpreadsheet operations.
        *   Keep PhpSpreadsheet updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for processing uploaded files.
        *   Implement input validation on data extracted from the spreadsheet before further processing.

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Primarily for XML-based formats like XLSX)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts an XLSX file containing malicious external entity declarations that, when parsed by PhpSpreadsheet, can lead to the server accessing or disclosing local files or internal network resources.
    *   **How PhpSpreadsheet Contributes:** PhpSpreadsheet uses XML parsing libraries to handle XLSX files. If not configured securely, these parsers might process external entities.
    *   **Example:** An XLSX file containing an external entity declaration that reads the `/etc/passwd` file on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the underlying XML parser used by PhpSpreadsheet to disable the processing of external entities.
        *   Keep PhpSpreadsheet and its XML parsing dependencies updated.
        *   Sanitize or filter XML content before processing.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion**
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads an extremely large or complex spreadsheet file that consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during processing by PhpSpreadsheet, leading to application slowdown or crashes.
    *   **How PhpSpreadsheet Contributes:** PhpSpreadsheet needs to load and process the entire spreadsheet file into memory. Very large or complex files can strain server resources.
    *   **Example:** Uploading a multi-megabyte XLSX file with hundreds of thousands of rows and columns, or a file with deeply nested styles and formatting.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, server instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement file size limits for uploaded spreadsheets.
        *   Set resource limits (memory, execution time) for PhpSpreadsheet operations.
        *   Consider asynchronous processing of large files.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and implement alerts.
