# Threat Model Analysis for phpoffice/phpspreadsheet

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload - Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/malicious_file_upload_-_exploiting_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted spreadsheet file (e.g., .xlsx, .ods, .csv) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet's file parsing logic. This could involve triggering buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues during the parsing process *within PHPSpreadsheet*.

**Impact:**  Could lead to denial of service (application crash due to PHPSpreadsheet issue), remote code execution on the server *due to a PHPSpreadsheet vulnerability*, or information disclosure by accessing sensitive memory regions *during PHPSpreadsheet's operation*.

**Affected Component:** File Readers (e.g., `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Xlsx`, `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Csv`, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use the latest stable version of PHPSpreadsheet and keep it updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   While file type validation is important, focus on the security of PHPSpreadsheet's parsing itself by staying updated.
*   Process uploaded files in a sandboxed environment or with restricted permissions to limit the impact of potential exploits *originating from PHPSpreadsheet*.
*   Implement resource limits (memory, execution time) when processing spreadsheet files to prevent resource exhaustion attacks *exploiting PHPSpreadsheet's processing*.

## Threat: [Formula Injection](./threats/formula_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a spreadsheet containing malicious formulas that, when evaluated by PHPSpreadsheet's calculation engine, can execute arbitrary code on the server, access sensitive information, or perform unintended actions *due to the functionality of PHPSpreadsheet's formula evaluation*.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Calculation Engine (`\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Calculation`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   If possible, disable formula calculation entirely if it's not a required feature for your application's use of PHPSpreadsheet.
*   Sanitize or escape user-provided data *before* embedding it into spreadsheets that will be processed by PHPSpreadsheet's calculation engine.
*   Carefully review and validate any formulas present in user-uploaded spreadsheets before processing *with PHPSpreadsheet's calculation engine*.
*   Consider using PHPSpreadsheet's security features or extensions (if available) designed to mitigate formula injection risks.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

**Description:** If PHPSpreadsheet's underlying parsing of certain spreadsheet formats (like XLSX which is XML-based) is vulnerable, an attacker could embed malicious external entity references within the spreadsheet. When processed *by PHPSpreadsheet's XML parsing*, this could allow the attacker to access local files on the server, internal network resources, or cause denial of service.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (reading local files), denial of service, or potentially server-side request forgery (SSRF).

**Affected Component:** XML Parsers used by File Readers (e.g., underlying XML processing libraries *as used by PHPSpreadsheet*)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the underlying XML parsing libraries used by PHPSpreadsheet are up-to-date and patched against XXE vulnerabilities.
*   Configure XML parsing *within PHPSpreadsheet's context* to disable external entity resolution. Check PHPSpreadsheet's documentation for relevant configuration options or consider using safer XML parsing configurations.
