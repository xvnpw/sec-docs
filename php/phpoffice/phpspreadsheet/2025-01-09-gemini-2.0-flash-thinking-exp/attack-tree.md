## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Maliciously crafted spreadsheet files are uploaded to the application.
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Upload a Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet File:** The attacker's action of providing the malicious file.
        * **Application Accepts User-Uploaded Files:** The application's functionality that enables this attack vector.
        * **PhpSpreadsheet Consumes Excessive Resources Parsing the File:**  The weakness in PhpSpreadsheet leading to Denial of Service.
        * **PhpSpreadsheet's Parsing Logic Contains a Vulnerability Leading to Code Execution:** A deeper flaw allowing for Remote Code Execution.
        * **Upload a Malicious Spreadsheet File with Crafted Content:**  Specifically targeting code execution vulnerabilities.
    * **Potential Impact:** Denial of Service (application unavailability), Remote Code Execution (full system compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__via_parsing.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting specific vulnerabilities within PhpSpreadsheet's parsing logic to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Upload a Malicious Spreadsheet File with Crafted Content:** The attacker provides a specially crafted file.
        * **Application Accepts User-Uploaded Files:**  The application's file upload functionality.
        * **PhpSpreadsheet's Parsing Logic Contains a Vulnerability Leading to Code Execution:** The core flaw in PhpSpreadsheet.
    * **Potential Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the server and application data.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Trigger XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_trigger_xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Uploading malicious XLSX files that contain external entity references, which PhpSpreadsheet processes, potentially leading to information disclosure or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Upload a Malicious XLSX File with External Entity References:** The attacker provides a malicious XLSX file.
        * **Application Accepts User-Uploaded XLSX Files:** The application's functionality for handling XLSX uploads.
        * **PhpSpreadsheet Parses the XML Without Proper Sanitization:** PhpSpreadsheet's vulnerable behavior.
        * **Exploitable Actions: Information Disclosure, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The direct consequences of successful XXE.
    * **Potential Impact:** High - Disclosure of sensitive internal data, ability to make requests to internal or external systems on behalf of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Formula Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_formula_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious formulas into spreadsheet files that are processed by PhpSpreadsheet, potentially leading to information disclosure or, in some cases, remote code execution (depending on the available functions and application context).
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Upload a Spreadsheet with Maliciously Crafted Formulas:** The attacker uploads a file with malicious formulas.
        * **Application Accepts User-Uploaded Files:** The application's file upload feature.
        * **PhpSpreadsheet Executes Formulas Without Proper Sanitization or Sandboxing:** PhpSpreadsheet's vulnerable behavior in evaluating formulas.
    * **Potential Impact:** Medium to High - Information disclosure, potentially Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Misconfiguration or Insecure Usage of PhpSpreadsheet by the Application](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_misconfiguration_or_insecure_usage_of_phpspreadsheet_by_the_application.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by how the application integrates and uses PhpSpreadsheet, rather than flaws within PhpSpreadsheet itself.
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Improper Input Sanitization Before Passing to PhpSpreadsheet:** The application's failure to properly sanitize user input.
        * **User Input (e.g., file path, sheet name) is Directly Used in PhpSpreadsheet Calls:**  A specific insecure coding practice.
        * **Application Fails to Sanitize Input Against Injection Attacks:** The underlying cause of the vulnerability.
        * **Exploitable Actions: Path Traversal, Information Disclosure:** The direct consequences of improper sanitization.
    * **Potential Impact:** Medium - Information disclosure, unauthorized access to files.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Using Outdated or Vulnerable Versions of PhpSpreadsheet](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_using_outdated_or_vulnerable_versions_of_phpspreadsheet.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the specific version of PhpSpreadsheet being used by the application.
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Application Uses an Old Version of PhpSpreadsheet:** The application is running a vulnerable version.
        * **That Version Has Known, Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities:** Publicly available exploits exist for the used version.
    * **Potential Impact:** High - Depends on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution, data breaches, etc.
