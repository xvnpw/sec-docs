# Attack Surface Analysis for phpoffice/phpspreadsheet

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet Files - File Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_spreadsheet_files_-_file_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within PHPSpreadsheet's parsing logic when handling various spreadsheet file formats (e.g., XLS, XLSX, ODS).

**How PHPSpreadsheet Contributes:** PHPSpreadsheet's core functionality involves parsing and interpreting complex file formats, making it directly susceptible to vulnerabilities in its parsing routines.

**Example:** A specially crafted XLSX file with an overly long string in a cell comment could trigger a buffer overflow in PHPSpreadsheet's parsing code.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure (e.g., server-side path disclosure in error messages).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploitability and impact).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input validation on uploaded files, checking file extensions and MIME types.
*   Keep PHPSpreadsheet updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Consider using a sandboxed environment for file processing to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement resource limits (e.g., memory limits, execution time limits) to mitigate DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet Files - XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_spreadsheet_files_-_xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet's XML parsing component (used for formats like XLSX) to include external entities, potentially leading to access of local files or internal network resources.

**How PHPSpreadsheet Contributes:** PHPSpreadsheet uses XML parsing libraries to handle the structure of XLSX files, which can be directly vulnerable to XXE if not configured securely within PHPSpreadsheet or its underlying dependencies.

**Example:** An attacker uploads an XLSX file containing a malicious XML payload that reads the contents of `/etc/passwd` on the server through PHPSpreadsheet's XML processing.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure (reading local files), Internal Network Scanning, Denial of Service (by referencing external resources).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Disable external entity and DTD processing in the underlying XML parser used by PHPSpreadsheet. Consult the documentation for the specific XML library used.
*   Sanitize or avoid processing untrusted spreadsheet files.

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet Files - Zip Slip/Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_spreadsheet_files_-_zip_slippath_traversal.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how PHPSpreadsheet handles zipped spreadsheet formats (like XLSX and ODS) by including files with malicious path components in their filenames, allowing them to be extracted outside the intended directory *by PHPSpreadsheet's extraction process*.

**How PHPSpreadsheet Contributes:** PHPSpreadsheet uses zip extraction libraries to handle these formats, and vulnerabilities *within PHPSpreadsheet's zip handling* can lead to files being written to arbitrary locations.

**Example:** An attacker uploads an XLSX file containing a file entry named `../../../../evil.php`, which, upon extraction by PHPSpreadsheet, could overwrite a critical application file.

**Impact:** File Overwrite, Potential Remote Code Execution (if overwriting executable files), Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Validate and sanitize filenames within the zipped archive before extraction *within PHPSpreadsheet's processing*.
*   Use secure extraction methods that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities *within PHPSpreadsheet or its underlying libraries*.

## Attack Surface: [Formula Injection](./attack_surfaces/formula_injection.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious code or commands through spreadsheet formulas, which PHPSpreadsheet then evaluates.

**How PHPSpreadsheet Contributes:** PHPSpreadsheet's core functionality includes evaluating spreadsheet formulas. If user-controlled data is directly incorporated into formulas that PHPSpreadsheet then processes, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A user provides input that is directly incorporated into a formula that PHPSpreadsheet evaluates, potentially leading to unintended actions or information disclosure.

**Impact:** Potential Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service (through resource-intensive formulas), Information Disclosure (accessing data the user shouldn't).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Never directly incorporate unsanitized user input into spreadsheet formulas that PHPSpreadsheet will evaluate.**
*   Sanitize user input intended for use in formulas, removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters or functions *before passing it to PHPSpreadsheet*.
*   Disable or restrict the use of potentially dangerous functions within formulas if PHPSpreadsheet provides such configuration options.
*   Consider using a sandboxed environment for formula evaluation if feasible.
