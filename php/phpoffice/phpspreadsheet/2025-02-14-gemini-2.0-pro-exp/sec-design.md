## BUILD

The PhpSpreadsheet project uses a combination of tools and processes for building and publishing the library.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits code" --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHub -- "Triggers" --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs" --> Composer["Composer Install"]
    Composer -- "Installs" --> Dependencies["Dependencies"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs" --> PHPUnit["PHPUnit (Unit Tests)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs" --> Psalm["Psalm (Static Analysis)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs" --> PHPCopyPasteDetector["PHP Copy/Paste Detector"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs" --> PHPMessDetector["PHP Mess Detector"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs" --> PHPCodeSniffer["PHP_CodeSniffer"]
    GitHubActions -- "Builds" --> Artifacts["Build Artifacts (Library Files)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Publishes" --> Packagist["Packagist (Composer Package)"]
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and commit it to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions, the CI/CD system used by the project, is triggered by commits and pull requests.
3.  The GitHub Actions workflow performs the following steps:
    *   Installs dependencies using Composer.
    *   Runs unit tests using PHPUnit.
    *   Performs static analysis using Psalm.
    *   Checks for code duplication using PHP Copy/Paste Detector.
    *   Checks for code quality issues using PHP Mess Detector.
    *   Enforces coding standards using PHP_CodeSniffer.
    *   If all checks pass, the workflow builds the library artifacts (the library files).
    *   Publishes the library as a Composer package on Packagist.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Dependency Management: Composer is used to manage dependencies, ensuring that specific versions of external libraries are used. `composer.lock` file locks dependencies to precise versions.
*   Static Analysis: Psalm is used for static analysis, which helps identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues before runtime.
*   Unit Tests: PHPUnit is used for unit testing, which helps ensure that the code functions as expected and reduces the risk of introducing bugs, including security vulnerabilities.
*   Code Quality Checks: PHP Copy/Paste Detector, PHP Mess Detector, and PHP_CodeSniffer are used to enforce code quality standards, which can indirectly improve security by reducing the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities due to poor coding practices.
*   CI/CD: GitHub Actions provides a consistent and automated build environment, reducing the risk of manual errors and ensuring that security checks are always performed.
*   Supply Chain Security: While Composer and Packagist are generally trusted, it's important to be aware of the potential for supply chain attacks. Regularly auditing dependencies and using tools like Dependabot (which is often integrated with GitHub) can help mitigate this risk.
