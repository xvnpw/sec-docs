## Attack Tree Path: [CSV Injection Path](./attack_tree_paths/csv_injection_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** CSV Injection (Formula Injection)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious CSV file containing spreadsheet formulas (e.g., starting with `=`, `@`, `+`, `-`).
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        *   Attacker uploads the malicious CSV file to the application.
        *   The application processes the CSV data and potentially allows users to download or open it in spreadsheet software (like Excel or LibreOffice).
        *   If the application *fails to sanitize* the CSV data before download, when a user opens the CSV, the spreadsheet software will execute the injected formulas.
        *   These formulas can potentially perform actions on the user's machine, such as:
            *   Executing commands on the user's operating system.
            *   Exfiltrating data from the user's machine.
            *   Modifying data on the user's machine.
    *   **Critical Nodes in this Path:**
        *   **Exploit CSV Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Targeting weaknesses in how CSV files are processed.
        *   **CSV Injection (Formula Injection):** The specific vulnerability being exploited.
        *   **Application Processes CSV Data without Sanitization:** The application's failure to prevent formula injection.
        *   **Upload Malicious CSV File with Formula Payload:** The attacker's action to introduce the malicious input.

## Attack Tree Path: [DoS via Large File Path](./attack_tree_paths/dos_via_large_file_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker aims to make the application unavailable by overloading its resources.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        *   Attacker uploads an extremely large spreadsheet file (e.g., many rows, columns, complex formulas) or a file with a structure that is computationally expensive to parse.
        *   The application uses PHPSpreadsheet to process this file.
        *   PHPSpreadsheet consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during parsing and processing.
        *   This resource exhaustion can lead to:
            *   Slow application response times.
            *   Application crashes.
            *   Server overload, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Critical Nodes in this Path:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious File:** The type of attack being performed.
        *   **Upload Extremely Large or Complex Spreadsheet File:** The attacker's action to trigger the DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection Path](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into database queries through data extracted from a spreadsheet.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        *   Attacker uploads a spreadsheet file containing malicious SQL code within cell values.
        *   The application uses PHPSpreadsheet to read data from the spreadsheet.
        *   The application *fails to sanitize or parameterize* this spreadsheet data when constructing SQL queries.
        *   The malicious SQL code is executed by the database, allowing the attacker to:
            *   Read sensitive data from the database.
            *   Modify or delete data in the database.
            *   Potentially gain control over the database server or the application.
    *   **Critical Nodes in this Path:**
        *   **Exploit Logical Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet API Usage (Application Side):** Targeting weaknesses in how the application uses the library.
        *   **Insecure Data Handling after PHPSpreadsheet Processing:** The general problem of not securing data after reading it from a spreadsheet.
        *   **SQL Injection via Unsanitized Spreadsheet Data:** The specific vulnerability being exploited.
        *   **Application Uses Spreadsheet Data in SQL Queries without Proper Sanitization:** The application's failure to prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [XSS Path](./attack_tree_paths/xss_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a spreadsheet, which is then executed in a user's browser when the application displays the spreadsheet data.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        *   Attacker uploads a spreadsheet file containing malicious JavaScript code within cell values (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
        *   The application uses PHPSpreadsheet to read data from the spreadsheet.
        *   The application *fails to properly encode* this spreadsheet data before displaying it in a web page.
        *   When a user views the web page, the browser executes the malicious JavaScript code, allowing the attacker to:
            *   Steal user session cookies.
            *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
            *   Deface the web page.
            *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Critical Nodes in this Path:**
        *   **Exploit Logical Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet API Usage (Application Side):** Targeting weaknesses in application usage.
        *   **Insecure Data Handling after PHPSpreadsheet Processing:** The general problem of not securing data after reading it from a spreadsheet.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Spreadsheet Data:** The specific vulnerability being exploited.
        *   **Application Displays Spreadsheet Data in Web Page without Proper Encoding:** The application's failure to prevent XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious File Execution Path](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_file_execution_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** Malicious File Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file disguised as a spreadsheet, and the application mistakenly executes it.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        *   Attacker attempts to upload a malicious file (e.g., PHP script, shell script, executable) while potentially using a spreadsheet file extension to bypass basic file type checks.
        *   The application *fails to properly validate* the file type based on its content and/or *incorrectly configures* the web server or application to execute uploaded files.
        *   The malicious file is executed by the server, allowing the attacker to:
            *   Gain complete control over the web server.
            *   Access sensitive data on the server.
            *   Compromise the entire application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Critical Nodes in this Path:**
        *   **Insecure File Upload/Processing Workflow:**  The overall insecure handling of file uploads.
        *   **Application Executes Uploaded Files:** The critical application misconfiguration that allows code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inadequate Input Validation Path](./attack_tree_paths/inadequate_input_validation_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** Logic Flaws and Data Corruption due to Inadequate Validation
    *   **Description:** The application fails to properly validate the *content* of the spreadsheet, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exploitation Steps:**
        *   Attacker uploads a spreadsheet file with unexpected or malicious content that is not directly an exploit, but causes issues due to lack of validation. This could include:
            *   Unexpected data types in cells.
            *   Data outside of expected ranges.
            *   Excessive amounts of data.
            *   Specific characters or formatting that breaks application logic.
        *   The application *fails to validate* this spreadsheet data appropriately.
        *   This lack of validation can lead to:
            *   Application errors and crashes.
            *   Data corruption within the application.
            *   Logic flaws that can be further exploited.
            *   Unexpected application behavior that might reveal sensitive information or create new attack vectors.
    *   **Critical Nodes in this Path:**
        *   **Insecure File Upload/Processing Workflow:** The broader issue of insecure file handling.
        *   **Inadequate Input Validation on Spreadsheet Content:** The specific weakness of not validating spreadsheet data.
        *   **Application Fails to Validate Spreadsheet Data Appropriately:** The application's failure to perform necessary validation.
