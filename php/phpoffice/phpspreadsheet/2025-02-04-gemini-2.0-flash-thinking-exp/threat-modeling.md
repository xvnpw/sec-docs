# Threat Model Analysis for phpoffice/phpspreadsheet

## Threat: [Malicious Formula Injection (File Parsing)](./threats/malicious_formula_injection__file_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted spreadsheet file containing malicious formulas (e.g., `=SYSTEM()`, `=WEBSERVICE()`). PhpSpreadsheet parses the file, and if formula evaluation is enabled or occurs indirectly, the malicious formulas could be executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Server Compromise, Data Breach, Privilege Escalation.
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Component Affected:**  Formula Parser, Calculation Engine (if enabled or indirectly triggered).  Primarily affects file readers (e.g., XLSX Reader, CSV Reader, ODS Reader).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Formula Calculation:**  If formula evaluation is not essential, disable it completely in PhpSpreadsheet configuration.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement strict file type validation and content checks to reject potentially malicious files.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run PhpSpreadsheet processing in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions to limit the impact of potential RCE.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep PhpSpreadsheet updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious spreadsheet (XLSX, ODS) containing crafted XML that exploits XXE vulnerabilities in PhpSpreadsheet's XML parsing process. This can allow the attacker to read local files, perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), or cause Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (local file access), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Component Affected:** XML Readers (specifically used by XLSX and ODS Readers), potentially underlying XML processing libraries used by PHP.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable External Entity Processing:** Configure PhpSpreadsheet and underlying XML libraries to disable external entity processing by default.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Update PhpSpreadsheet and its dependencies to patch known XXE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement input validation to detect and reject suspicious XML structures in uploaded files.

## Threat: [Zip Bomb / Decompression Bomb](./threats/zip_bomb__decompression_bomb.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a small, compressed spreadsheet file (XLSX, ODS) that expands to an enormous size when decompressed by PhpSpreadsheet. This can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to Denial of Service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Resource Exhaustion, Application Unavailability.
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Component Affected:** ZIP Archive Handling (used by XLSX and ODS Readers), File Readers (XLSX Reader, ODS Reader).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File Size Limits:** Implement strict limits on the size of uploaded files.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Set resource limits (memory, CPU time) for PhpSpreadsheet processing to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Streaming/Iterative Parsing:** If available in PhpSpreadsheet, use streaming or iterative parsing methods to limit memory usage during decompression and processing.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow / Memory Corruption in Parsers](./threats/buffer_overflow__memory_corruption_in_parsers.md)

*   **Description:**  A malformed or excessively large spreadsheet file exploits bugs in PhpSpreadsheet's parsing logic (for any format: CSV, XLSX, ODS, etc.). This can lead to buffer overflows or memory corruption, potentially causing crashes, Denial of Service, or in severe cases, Remote Code Execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Application Crash, Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Component Affected:** File Readers (CSV Reader, XLSX Reader, ODS Reader, etc.), Parsing Logic for specific file formats.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if RCE is possible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep PhpSpreadsheet updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing:** Conduct fuzzing and security testing of PhpSpreadsheet integration with various file formats and malformed files.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits to mitigate DoS from crashes.

## Threat: [Known Vulnerabilities in PhpSpreadsheet (Unpatched)](./threats/known_vulnerabilities_in_phpspreadsheet__unpatched_.md)

*   **Description:**  PhpSpreadsheet itself may contain undiscovered or unpatched security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of PhpSpreadsheet.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution.
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Component Affected:** Core library code, various modules depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  **Crucially, keep PhpSpreadsheet updated to the latest stable version.** Monitor security advisories and release notes.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use static analysis tools and vulnerability scanners to identify potential weaknesses in the application's use of PhpSpreadsheet and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in PhpSpreadsheet Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_phpspreadsheet_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** PhpSpreadsheet relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly compromise applications using PhpSpreadsheet.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability, could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution.
*   **PhpSpreadsheet Component Affected:** Indirectly affects the entire library through dependency chain.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management and Updates:** Use dependency management tools (like Composer) to track and update PhpSpreadsheet and all its dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using security tools.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories for PhpSpreadsheet's dependencies.
