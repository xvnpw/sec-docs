# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a set of classes that allow developers to read and write various spreadsheet file formats (Excel, CSV, etc.).
*   Maintain compatibility with a wide range of PHP versions.
*   Ensure the library is easy to use and integrate into existing PHP projects.
*   Maintain a high level of code quality and stability.
*   Provide a solution that is actively maintained and supported.

Business Risks:

*   Data breaches: Sensitive data stored in spreadsheets could be exposed if the library has vulnerabilities.
*   Data corruption: Errors in the library could lead to data loss or corruption in spreadsheets.
*   Compatibility issues: Changes in PHP or spreadsheet formats could break the library's functionality.
*   Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient code could lead to slow processing of large spreadsheets.
*   Reputational damage: Security vulnerabilities or bugs could damage the reputation of the library and its maintainers.
*   Supply chain attacks: Compromised dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities into the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input validation: The library likely performs some input validation to prevent processing malicious files. (Needs to be verified in the code and documentation).
*   security control: Code reviews: The project uses pull requests, suggesting code reviews are part of the development process. (Visible on GitHub).
*   security control: Static analysis: The project may use static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities. (Needs to be verified in the project configuration).
*   security control: Dependency management: The project uses Composer to manage dependencies, which helps ensure that known vulnerable versions are not used. (Visible in `composer.json`).
*   security control: Testing: The project has a test suite, which helps to identify bugs and regressions. (Visible in the `tests` directory).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Compatibility with older PHP versions may limit the use of newer security features.
*   accepted risk: The library handles complex file formats, increasing the attack surface.
*   accepted risk: The library relies on external dependencies, which may introduce vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive security policy that covers all aspects of the development lifecycle.
*   security control: Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing.
*   security control: Use a SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tool to automatically scan the codebase for vulnerabilities. Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Use a DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tool to test the running application for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   security control: Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) if any web-based interaction is present.
*   security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as the library is used within other applications. However, if the library interacts with external services, it should use secure authentication mechanisms.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as the library is used within other applications. However, if the library interacts with external services, it should use appropriate authorization mechanisms.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library MUST validate all input data, including file contents, file names, and configuration parameters.
    *   The library MUST reject any input that does not conform to the expected format.
    *   The library MUST sanitize input to prevent injection attacks.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If the library handles sensitive data, it MUST use strong encryption algorithms to protect the data at rest and in transit.
    *   The library MUST use a secure random number generator when generating cryptographic keys or nonces.
    *   The library MUST securely store any cryptographic keys.
*   Output Encoding:
    *   The library MUST encode output data appropriately to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, if applicable.

## BUILD

The PhpSpreadsheet project uses a combination of manual and automated build processes.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Writes code" --> LocalCode["Local Code Repository"]
    LocalCode -- "git push" --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHub -- "Triggers" --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs Tests" --> TestResults["Test Results"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs Static Analysis" --> AnalysisResults["Analysis Results"]
    GitHubActions -- "Builds Documentation" --> Documentation["Documentation"]
    Developer -- "Creates Release" --> GitHubRelease["GitHub Release (Artifacts)"]
    ComposerServer["Composer Repository (Packagist)"] -- "Pulls from" --> GitHubRelease

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and commit it to a local Git repository.
2.  Changes are pushed to the central GitHub repository.
3.  GitHub Actions (CI) is triggered on push and pull requests.
4.  GitHub Actions runs unit tests and static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm).
5.  Documentation is built automatically.
6.  Releases are created manually by developers on GitHub. This typically involves tagging a specific commit.
7.  Composer (Packagist) pulls the released code from GitHub, making it available for installation via `composer require`.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code reviews: Pull requests on GitHub enforce code reviews before merging changes.
*   security control: Automated testing: GitHub Actions runs unit tests to catch bugs and regressions.
*   security control: Static analysis: GitHub Actions runs static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency management: Composer manages dependencies and helps ensure that known vulnerable versions are not used.
*   security control: Version control: Git tracks all code changes, allowing for easy auditing and rollback.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Reading and writing spreadsheet data accurately and reliably.
*   Maintaining compatibility with various spreadsheet formats.
*   Providing a stable and performant library for developers.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Spreadsheet data can range from non-sensitive to highly sensitive, depending on the user's application.
*   The library itself does not store data persistently, but it handles data in memory during processing.
*   Sensitivity levels:
    *   Public: Non-sensitive data, such as publicly available spreadsheets.
    *   Internal: Data that is not intended for public disclosure, but is not highly sensitive.
    *   Confidential: Sensitive data that could cause harm if disclosed, such as financial data or personal information.
    *   Restricted: Highly sensitive data that requires strict access controls, such as trade secrets or government classified information.
