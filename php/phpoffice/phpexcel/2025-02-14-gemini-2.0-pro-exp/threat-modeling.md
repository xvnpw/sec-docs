# Threat Model Analysis for phpoffice/phpexcel

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (XLSX)](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__xlsx_.md)

*   **Threat:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (XLSX)

    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted XLSX file (a zipped XML file) containing malicious XML External Entities (XXE). When PhpSpreadsheet's XML parser processes the file, it may attempt to resolve these external entities *if not properly configured*. This can lead to:
        *   **Local File Disclosure:** Reading arbitrary files from the server's file system.
        *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Making requests to internal or external services from the server, potentially bypassing firewalls.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Consuming server resources by resolving large or recursive entities (e.g., "billion laughs" attack).
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive files, internal network information), potential SSRF attacks leading to further compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Affected PhpSpreadsheet Component:** `Reader\Xlsx`, specifically the underlying XML parsing components (likely those using PHP's `SimpleXML` or `XMLReader`). The vulnerability lies in how the XML parser is *configured* and used within PhpSpreadsheet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable External Entity Loading (Crucial):**  Configure the XML parser used by PhpSpreadsheet to *explicitly disable* the loading of external entities and DTDs. This is the *primary* and most effective mitigation. This is typically done *before* PhpSpreadsheet is used, using PHP's `libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);` and potentially other libxml options like `LIBXML_NOENT`, `LIBXML_DTDLOAD`, and `LIBXML_DTDATTR`.  Ensure this configuration is applied *globally* to the PHP environment or specifically to the code that uses PhpSpreadsheet.
        *   **Input Validation (Secondary):** While not a primary defense against XXE, validating the *structure* of the uploaded XLSX file (as much as is feasible without fully parsing it) *might* help detect some obviously malformed files. However, this is not reliable.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary file system permissions. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they successfully read a file.

## Threat: [Code Injection (Vulnerability in PhpSpreadsheet or Dependencies)](./threats/code_injection__vulnerability_in_phpspreadsheet_or_dependencies_.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection (Vulnerability in PhpSpreadsheet or Dependencies)

    *   **Description:** This is a hypothetical but *critical* threat. If a vulnerability exists in PhpSpreadsheet's parsing logic (e.g., a buffer overflow, an unvalidated input used in a code execution context within a `Reader` or `Writer`), or in a *direct dependency* like the XML parser, an attacker could craft a malicious spreadsheet file that exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the *server*. This is less likely with a well-maintained library, but it remains a possibility, especially with older, unpatched versions or if a zero-day vulnerability is discovered.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the server, complete system compromise, potential data breaches, and lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected PhpSpreadsheet Component:** Potentially *any* `Reader` or `Writer` component, or even core library functions, depending on the specific vulnerability. The vulnerability could also reside in a *direct dependency* of PhpSpreadsheet, such as the PHP XML extension.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep PhpSpreadsheet Updated (Paramount):** This is the *single most important* mitigation. Regularly update to the *latest stable version* of PhpSpreadsheet to patch any known vulnerabilities. This includes keeping PHP and its extensions (especially the XML extension) up-to-date.
        *   **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):** While rigorous input validation is good practice, it's *not* a reliable defense against all code injection vulnerabilities. It might mitigate *some* risks, but it cannot be relied upon as the sole defense.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges. This significantly limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve code execution. Use a dedicated, unprivileged user account for the web server and application.
        *   **Sandboxing (Strong Mitigation):** Run the spreadsheet processing component in a *sandboxed environment* (e.g., a container like Docker, a chroot jail, or a separate process with severely restricted permissions). This isolates the vulnerable component and prevents it from affecting the rest of the system, even if compromised.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF *might* be able to detect and block *some* exploit attempts, but it's not a foolproof solution.
        *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests of the application and its dependencies to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - Highly Complex File within Parsing Logic](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos__-_highly_complex_file_within_parsing_logic.md)

* **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - Highly Complex File within Parsing Logic

    * **Description:** While general resource exhaustion from large files is a concern, this specific threat focuses on vulnerabilities *within* PhpSpreadsheet's parsing logic that could be triggered by a *highly complex* but not necessarily *large* file. For example, a file with deeply nested formulas, unusual object structures, or specific combinations of features could trigger excessive recursion or inefficient processing *within* PhpSpreadsheet, leading to a denial-of-service. This is distinct from simply uploading a huge file.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability.
    * **Affected PhpSpreadsheet Component:** All `Reader` components (`Reader\Xlsx`, `Reader\Xls`, `Reader\Csv`, `Reader\Ods`, etc.). The specific component and vulnerability would depend on the crafted file.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep PhpSpreadsheet Updated:** As with code injection, staying up-to-date is crucial to patch any vulnerabilities in parsing logic.
        * **Timeouts (Specific to Parsing):** Set timeouts *specifically* for the PhpSpreadsheet reading operations, independent of any general application timeouts. This prevents a complex file from consuming resources indefinitely.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) during spreadsheet processing and implement alerts for excessive consumption *specifically* related to PhpSpreadsheet.
        * **Input Validation (Structure-Aware):** If possible, implement some level of *structure-aware* input validation. This is difficult to do comprehensively, but even basic checks for excessive nesting or unusual patterns could help. This is *not* a primary defense.
        * **Sandboxing:** As with code injection, sandboxing the processing can limit the impact of a DoS vulnerability.
        * **Rate Limiting (Targeted):** Implement rate limiting specifically for spreadsheet processing, potentially with stricter limits than general file uploads.
