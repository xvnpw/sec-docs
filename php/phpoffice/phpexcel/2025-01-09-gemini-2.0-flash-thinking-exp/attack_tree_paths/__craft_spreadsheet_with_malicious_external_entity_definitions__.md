## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Craft Spreadsheet with Malicious External Entity Definitions

This analysis delves into the attack path "Craft Spreadsheet with Malicious External Entity Definitions" targeting applications using the PHPSpreadsheet library (formerly PHPExcel). We will break down the mechanics of this attack, its potential impact, and crucial mitigation strategies for the development team.

**Attack Tree Path:** [ Craft Spreadsheet with Malicious External Entity Definitions ]

**Description:** This attack involves creating a specially crafted spreadsheet file (e.g., XLSX) containing XML that defines external entities. When a vulnerable application using PHPSpreadsheet processes this spreadsheet, the XML parser within the library can be tricked into resolving these external entities, potentially leading to various security vulnerabilities.

**Technical Breakdown:**

1. **Understanding XML External Entities (XXE):**
   - XML allows defining entities, which are essentially shortcuts for text or other XML structures.
   - **Internal Entities:** Defined within the XML document itself.
   - **External Entities:** Defined outside the XML document, referencing external resources via a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
   - **The Vulnerability:** If an XML parser is configured to process external entities and does not properly sanitize or restrict the URIs, an attacker can define malicious external entities pointing to sensitive local files, internal network resources, or even external malicious servers.

2. **Spreadsheet Structure and XML:**
   - Modern spreadsheet formats like XLSX are essentially ZIP archives containing various XML files that define the spreadsheet's structure, data, styles, and relationships.
   - PHPSpreadsheet parses these XML files to extract and process the spreadsheet data.
   - Attackers can inject malicious external entity definitions into various XML files within the XLSX archive, such as:
     - `xl/workbook.xml`: Contains general workbook information.
     - `xl/sharedStrings.xml`: Stores shared string values.
     - `xl/styles.xml`: Defines cell styles.
     - `xl/drawings/drawing1.xml`:  Handles embedded images and other drawing objects.
     - `xl/externalLinks/externalLink1.xml`:  Manages links to external data sources.

3. **Crafting the Malicious Spreadsheet:**
   - The attacker needs to create an XLSX file containing a malicious XML payload. This can be done manually or using scripting tools.
   - The core of the attack lies in the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration within the XML file. This declaration can define custom entities.
   - **Example Malicious Payload:**

     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <!DOCTYPE foo [
      <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
     ]>
     <root>
       <data>&xxe;</data>
     </root>
     ```

     - In this example, an external entity named `xxe` is defined, pointing to the `/etc/passwd` file on the server. When the XML parser processes `&xxe;`, it attempts to read the contents of this file.

4. **Exploiting PHPSpreadsheet's XML Parsing:**
   - PHPSpreadsheet uses PHP's built-in XML processing libraries (like `libxml`) to parse the XML files within the spreadsheet.
   - If these libraries are not configured securely (specifically, if external entity loading is enabled), the malicious entity definition will be processed.
   - When PHPSpreadsheet encounters the malicious entity reference (e.g., `&xxe;`), the XML parser will attempt to resolve the external entity, leading to the vulnerability.

**Potential Impacts of a Successful Attack:**

* **Information Disclosure:**
    - **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system that the application has access to. This could include configuration files, application code, database credentials, and other sensitive information.
    - **Sensitive Data Extraction:**  Accessing files containing user data, API keys, or other confidential information.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    - The attacker can force the server to make requests to internal or external resources.
    - This can be used to scan internal networks, access internal services that are not exposed to the internet, or interact with external APIs.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    - **Billion Laughs Attack (XML Bomb):**  Crafting nested entities that expand exponentially, consuming excessive server resources and potentially leading to a crash.
    - **Resource Exhaustion:**  Forcing the server to download large files from external sources.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Less Common, but Possible):**
    - In specific scenarios, if the fetched content from the external entity can influence server-side execution (e.g., through a poorly implemented processing mechanism), it might be possible to achieve RCE. This is generally more complex to exploit via XXE in the context of spreadsheet processing.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify a Vulnerable Application:** The attacker targets an application that uses PHPSpreadsheet to process user-uploaded or externally sourced spreadsheets.
2. **Craft the Malicious Spreadsheet:** Create an XLSX file containing a malicious XML payload with external entity definitions targeting desired resources.
3. **Upload/Submit the Spreadsheet:**  Upload the crafted spreadsheet to the vulnerable application through a file upload form or other input mechanism.
4. **Trigger Processing:** The application processes the uploaded spreadsheet using PHPSpreadsheet.
5. **Exploitation:** PHPSpreadsheet's XML parser attempts to resolve the malicious external entities.
6. **Impact:** Depending on the crafted payload, the attacker can achieve information disclosure, SSRF, or potentially DoS.

**Mitigation Strategies for the Development Team:**

* **Disable External Entity Processing:** This is the most effective and recommended mitigation. Configure PHP's XML processing libraries to disallow external entity loading. This can be done programmatically:

   ```php
   // For DOMDocument
   $dom = new DOMDocument();
   $dom->loadXML($xml, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD);

   // For XMLReader
   $reader = new XMLReader();
   $reader->open($file);
   $reader->setParserProperty(XMLReader::LOADDTD, false);
   $reader->setParserProperty(XMLReader::SUBST_ENTITIES, false);
   ```

   **Important:** Ensure this configuration is applied consistently across all parts of the application that process XML, including PHPSpreadsheet's internal usage.

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** While not a direct solution for XXE, rigorous input validation can help prevent the injection of malicious XML structures in the first place. However, relying solely on input validation is not sufficient against XXE.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the user account running the web server and PHP processes has minimal necessary permissions. This can limit the impact of a successful LFI attack.

* **Regularly Update PHPSpreadsheet:** Keep PHPSpreadsheet and its dependencies updated to the latest versions. Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests containing suspicious XML payloads. Configure the WAF to inspect XML content for potential XXE attacks.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily focused on browser security, a well-configured CSP can help mitigate the impact of SSRF by restricting the origins the application can make requests to.

* **Secure Configuration of XML Parsers:**  Review the configuration of any other XML parsing libraries used within the application and ensure external entity processing is disabled by default.

* **Code Reviews and Security Audits:** Regularly review the codebase for potential vulnerabilities, including how PHPSpreadsheet is used and how XML data is processed. Conduct security audits to identify and address potential weaknesses.

**Considerations for Development Team:**

* **Awareness:** Ensure the development team is aware of the risks associated with XXE vulnerabilities and how they can manifest in the context of processing spreadsheet files.
* **Secure Defaults:** Advocate for secure default configurations in PHPSpreadsheet or consider wrapping its usage with custom logic that enforces secure XML parsing settings.
* **Testing:** Implement security testing, including penetration testing, to specifically check for XXE vulnerabilities in the application's spreadsheet processing functionality.

**Conclusion:**

The "Craft Spreadsheet with Malicious External Entity Definitions" attack path highlights a significant security risk when processing untrusted spreadsheet files with libraries like PHPSpreadsheet. By understanding the mechanics of XXE and implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly disabling external entity processing in XML parsers, development teams can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect their applications from potential information disclosure, SSRF, and other related vulnerabilities. A layered approach, combining secure coding practices, regular updates, and security monitoring, is crucial for maintaining a secure application.
