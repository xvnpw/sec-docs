## Attack Tree Path: [[ Exploit Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet Processing ] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phpspreadsheet_processing____critical_node_.md)

This represents the overarching goal of exploiting weaknesses within the PHPSpreadsheet library itself, encompassing vulnerabilities during both file reading and writing. It's critical because it's the entry point for all PHPSpreadsheet-specific attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Exploit Vulnerabilities During File Reading ] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_vulnerabilities_during_file_reading____critical_node_.md)

This focuses on attacks that occur when the application processes a spreadsheet file, particularly one provided by an attacker. This is a critical node because it exposes the application to various injection and parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Inject Malicious Formulas ] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__inject_malicious_formulas____critical_node_.md)

Attackers craft spreadsheet files containing formulas designed to perform unintended actions when evaluated by PHPSpreadsheet. This is critical due to the potential for direct code execution or data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Craft Spreadsheet with Malicious Formulas ] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__craft_spreadsheet_with_malicious_formulas____critical_node_.md)

This is the specific action of creating a spreadsheet file with harmful formulas. It's a critical step as it's the point where the malicious payload is introduced.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Formulas Executing Arbitrary Code ]](./attack_tree_paths/__formulas_executing_arbitrary_code__.md)

Maliciously crafted formulas can potentially be used to execute arbitrary code on the server where the application is running. This is a severe vulnerability if exploitable.

    *   **Critical Node: Gain Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation of formula execution leads to the attacker gaining the ability to run commands on the server, representing a complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Formulas Exfiltrating Data ]](./attack_tree_paths/__formulas_exfiltrating_data__.md)

Attackers can use formulas to access and send sensitive data from the server to an external location controlled by the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (if processing XML-based formats like XLSX) ]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__if_processing_xml-based_formats_like_xlsx___.md)

When processing XML-based spreadsheet formats (like XLSX), attackers can inject malicious external entity definitions into the XML data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Craft Spreadsheet with Malicious External Entity Definitions ]](./attack_tree_paths/__craft_spreadsheet_with_malicious_external_entity_definitions__.md)

This involves creating a spreadsheet (e.g., XLSX) containing specially crafted XML that defines external entities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Read Local Files ] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/__read_local_files____critical_node_.md)

By exploiting XXE, an attacker can force the server to read local files on the system. This can expose sensitive configuration files, credentials, or other critical data.

    *   **Critical Node: Access sensitive files on the server:** Successful exploitation of XXE to read local files directly compromises the confidentiality of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Exploit Vulnerabilities in Specific File Format Handling (e.g., XLS, CSV) ]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_specific_file_format_handling__e_g___xls__csv___.md)

PHPSpreadsheet needs to parse various spreadsheet formats, and vulnerabilities can exist in the parsing logic for specific formats.

## Attack Tree Path: [[ Exploit vulnerabilities in CSV parsing (e.g., CSV injection leading to command injection if output is not sanitized) ]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_csv_parsing__e_g___csv_injection_leading_to_command_injection_if_output_3a080644.md)

Specifically targeting vulnerabilities in how PHPSpreadsheet handles CSV files. A common attack is CSV injection, where malicious content is injected into CSV cells. If this CSV data is later used unsafely by the application (e.g., in system commands), it can lead to command execution.

    *   **Critical Node: Gain command execution:**  Successful exploitation of CSV injection leading to the application executing attacker-controlled commands on the server. This is a critical compromise.
