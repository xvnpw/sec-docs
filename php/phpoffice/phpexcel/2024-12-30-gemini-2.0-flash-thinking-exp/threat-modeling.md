### High and Critical PHPSpreadsheet Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats directly involving the PHPSpreadsheet library:

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Spreadsheet File (Parsing Vulnerability)
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads or provides a specially crafted spreadsheet file (e.g., XLSX, XLS, CSV) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet's parsing logic. This could involve malformed file structures, unexpected data types, or excessive nesting.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application or exhausting server resources, potential for remote code execution (RCE) if vulnerabilities in the parsing engine allow it, or information disclosure by triggering unexpected behavior that reveals sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability - RCE is critical, DoS is high).

*   **Threat:** Formula Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious formulas into spreadsheet cells when the application allows user-controlled data to be used in spreadsheet formulas processed by PHPSpreadsheet.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the server *if vulnerabilities exist in the formula evaluation engine*, or retrieval of sensitive data from the server's file system or environment variables.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if RCE is possible, High if information disclosure is the primary risk).

*   **Threat:** External Entity Injection (XXE) in Spreadsheet Formats
    *   **Description:** Some spreadsheet formats (like XLSX) are based on XML. If PHPSpreadsheet's XML parsing is not properly configured to prevent external entity resolution, an attacker could craft a malicious spreadsheet to access local files or internal network resources on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading local files), denial of service (by causing the server to attempt to access unavailable resources), or potentially server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive information can be accessed).

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet Dependencies
    *   **Description:** PHPSpreadsheet relies on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect the application.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be High or Critical).

*   **Threat:** Using an Outdated PHPSpreadsheet Version
    *   **Description:** Using an outdated version of PHPSpreadsheet with known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure to the known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to any of the threats mentioned above.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerabilities present in the outdated version (can be High or Critical).
