# Attack Surface Analysis for phpoffice/phpexcel

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted File Upload and Processing](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_file_upload_and_processing.md)

* **Description:** Accepting and processing spreadsheet files from untrusted sources, where malicious files can exploit vulnerabilities in PHPExcel's parsing logic.
* **PHPExcel Contribution:** PHPExcel is designed to parse and process various spreadsheet file formats. Vulnerabilities in its parsing logic are directly exploited by malicious files processed by PHPExcel.
* **Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted XLSX file containing a buffer overflow vulnerability in PHPExcel's XML parsing. Processing this file with PHPExcel leads to remote code execution on the server.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict File Type Validation:** Only allow uploads of necessary file types and rigorously validate file extensions and MIME types on the server-side.
    * **File Size Limits:** Implement strict file size limits to mitigate DoS attacks.
    * **Sandboxed Processing:** Process uploaded files in a highly isolated, sandboxed environment with severely limited resource access to contain any potential exploit.
    * **Regularly Update PHPExcel (or migrate to PhpSpreadsheet):**  Immediately update to the latest stable version of PHPExcel or, ideally, migrate to PhpSpreadsheet to benefit from critical security patches.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (XLSX format)](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__xlsx_format_.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in PHPExcel's XML parsing of XLSX files to access local files or internal network resources.
* **PHPExcel Contribution:** PHPExcel parses XLSX files, which are XML-based. Vulnerable XML parsing within PHPExcel directly allows for XXE attacks through malicious XLSX files.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious XLSX file with an external entity definition pointing to `/etc/passwd`. When PHPExcel parses this file, it reads and exposes the contents of the sensitive `/etc/passwd` file.
* **Impact:** Information Disclosure (access to sensitive local files, internal network resources).
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Disable External Entity Resolution in XML Parsing:**  Forcefully disable external entity resolution in the XML parsing configuration used by PHPExcel. This is a critical security configuration.
    * **Use a Secure XML Parser (if configurable within PHPExcel):** Ensure the underlying XML parser used by PHPExcel is robust and patched against XXE vulnerabilities.
    * **Regularly Update PHPExcel (or migrate to PhpSpreadsheet):** Apply security updates for PHPExcel and its dependencies promptly.

## Attack Surface: [Zip Slip Vulnerability (XLSX, ODS formats)](./attack_surfaces/zip_slip_vulnerability__xlsx__ods_formats_.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in PHPExcel's ZIP archive extraction for XLSX and ODS files to write files outside the intended extraction directory, potentially leading to arbitrary file write and remote code execution.
* **PHPExcel Contribution:** PHPExcel handles ZIP-based formats. Insecure ZIP extraction within PHPExcel allows malicious ZIP archives to write files to arbitrary locations.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious XLSX file containing a file entry with a path like `../../../malicious.php`. PHPExcel's extraction writes `malicious.php` to a web-accessible directory, enabling remote code execution.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary File Write, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure ZIP Extraction:** Implement and enforce secure file extraction functions that strictly prevent path traversal. Thoroughly validate and sanitize extracted file paths to ensure they remain within the intended directory.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (File System Access):** Run the PHP process with minimal file system write permissions to limit the damage from Zip Slip.
    * **Regularly Update PHPExcel (or migrate to PhpSpreadsheet):**  Apply updates that address Zip Slip vulnerabilities in PHPExcel or its dependencies.
