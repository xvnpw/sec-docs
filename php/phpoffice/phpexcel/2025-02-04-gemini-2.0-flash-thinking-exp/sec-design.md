# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable PHP developers to efficiently process spreadsheet files (e.g., XLSX, CSV, ODS).
  - Provide a reliable and feature-rich library for reading, writing, and manipulating spreadsheet data.
  - Ensure compatibility with various spreadsheet file formats and versions.
  - Facilitate data exchange between PHP applications and spreadsheet software.
  - Support data analysis, reporting, and data transformation tasks within PHP environments.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in PHPExcel could lead to data breaches, data corruption, or denial of service in applications using the library.
  - Incompatibility with emerging or less common spreadsheet formats could limit the library's usefulness.
  - Performance bottlenecks when processing large or complex spreadsheet files could negatively impact application performance.
  - Bugs in data processing logic could result in incorrect data transformations or calculations, leading to business errors.
  - Lack of timely security updates and maintenance could expose users to known vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review by project maintainers and community contributors (location: GitHub pull requests and issue discussions).
  - security control: Unit and integration tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions (location: test suite in the GitHub repository).
  - security control: Public vulnerability reporting through GitHub issues and security advisories (location: GitHub repository issues and security tab).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered security vulnerabilities in the codebase due to complexity and broad functionality.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the open-source community for timely vulnerability reporting and security patches.
  - accepted risk: Risk of vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by PHPExcel.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Integrate Dependency Vulnerability Scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by PHPExcel.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Implement Fuzz testing for spreadsheet file parsing logic to discover vulnerabilities related to malformed or malicious input files.
  - security control: Establish a clear security incident response plan to handle reported vulnerabilities and release security patches promptly.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Applications using PHPExcel are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Applications using PHPExcel are responsible for their own authorization mechanisms to control access to spreadsheet data.
  - Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all spreadsheet file formats parsed by PHPExcel to prevent vulnerabilities such as XML External Entity (XXE) injection, formula injection, and denial-of-service attacks.
    - security requirement: Validate file structure and data types according to the specifications of each supported spreadsheet format.
    - security requirement: Handle potentially malicious or malformed spreadsheet files gracefully without causing crashes or security breaches.
  - Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Ensure secure handling of encrypted spreadsheet files, if supported by PHPExcel.
    - security requirement: If PHPExcel implements any cryptographic operations internally, use well-vetted and secure cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Data import and export using spreadsheet files in applications that rely on PHPExcel.
  - Data processing, reporting, and analysis workflows that utilize spreadsheet data through PHPExcel.
  - Application functionality that depends on the correct and secure handling of spreadsheet files.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Spreadsheet data itself is the primary data to protect.
  - Sensitivity of data depends on the context of applications using PHPExcel. Spreadsheet files can contain:
    - Business sensitive data (financial records, sales data, strategic plans).
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (customer lists, employee data).
    - Confidential research data or intellectual property.
  - The sensitivity level can range from low (publicly available data) to high (highly confidential and regulated data). The impact of a data breach or data corruption would vary accordingly.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific use cases and applications for PHPExcel that are of most concern from a security perspective? (e.g., processing user-uploaded spreadsheets, automated data import from external sources).
  - What is the expected sensitivity level of the data being processed by PHPExcel in typical use cases?
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements that apply to applications using PHPExcel (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
  - What is the current process for handling security vulnerability reports for PHPExcel?
  - Is there a dedicated security team or person responsible for overseeing the security of PHPExcel?
- Assumptions:
  - PHPExcel is used in applications that handle potentially sensitive data from spreadsheet files.
  - The primary security concern is related to vulnerabilities in parsing untrusted spreadsheet files, which could lead to data breaches, denial of service, or other security impacts.
  - Security is a significant concern for users of PHPExcel, especially in enterprise environments.
  - The project aims to maintain a reasonable level of security for an open-source library, relying on community contributions and best practices.
