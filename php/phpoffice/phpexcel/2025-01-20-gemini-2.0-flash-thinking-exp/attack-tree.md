# Attack Tree Analysis for phpoffice/phpexcel

Objective: Compromise application using PHPSpreadsheet by exploiting its weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application Using PHPSpreadsheet **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet Parsing **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious File **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Vulnerability in Specific Format Parser (e.g., XLS, XLSX, CSV, ODS) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Primarily XLSX/ODS) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Exploit Formula Injection (though PHPSpreadsheet aims to mitigate this)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using PHPSpreadsheet](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_phpspreadsheet.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Using PHPSpreadsheet:** This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has gained unauthorized access or control over the application and potentially its underlying systems and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phpspreadsheet_parsing.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet Parsing:** This is a critical stage where the attacker leverages weaknesses in how PHPSpreadsheet interprets spreadsheet file formats. Successful exploitation here can lead to various severe outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious File](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_remote_code_execution__rce__via_malicious_file.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious File:** This is a highly critical stage. If the attacker can trigger RCE, they can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Specific Format Parser (e.g., XLS, XLSX, CSV, ODS)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_specific_format_parser__e_g___xls__xlsx__csv__ods_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Vulnerability in Specific Format Parser (e.g., XLS, XLSX, CSV, ODS):** This node represents the exploitation of specific flaws within the code responsible for parsing different spreadsheet file formats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Primarily XLSX/ODS)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__primarily_xlsxods_.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Primarily XLSX/ODS):** This node highlights the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in the XML parsing component used for formats like XLSX and ODS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet Parsing -> Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious File -> Exploit Vulnerability in Specific Format Parser:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phpspreadsheet_parsing_-_trigger_remote_code_execution__rce__via_maliciou_8477a73c.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious spreadsheet file specifically designed to exploit a buffer overflow, integer overflow, deserialization vulnerability, or other code execution flaw within the parser for a specific file format (e.g., a specially crafted XLSX file targeting a vulnerability in the XLSX parser).
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires a specific vulnerability to exist and be exploitable).
    * **Impact:** High (Full server compromise, data breach, etc.).
    * **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of the vulnerability and file format).
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by memory corruption monitoring or specific vulnerability signatures).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet Parsing -> Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious File -> Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Primarily XLSX/ODS):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phpspreadsheet_parsing_-_trigger_remote_code_execution__rce__via_maliciou_cdab389e.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious XLSX or ODS file containing specially crafted XML that defines external entities. When PHPSpreadsheet parses this file, it attempts to resolve these entities, potentially leading to:
        * **Reading Local Files:** The external entity points to a sensitive file on the server's filesystem, allowing the attacker to retrieve its contents.
        * **Triggering Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The external entity points to an internal or external URL, causing the server to make a request to that URL.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (XXE is a relatively common vulnerability).
    * **Impact:** Medium to High (Information disclosure, SSRF leading to further attacks).
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires understanding of XML and XXE).
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring outbound connections or XML parsing errors).
