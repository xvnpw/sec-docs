# Threat Model Analysis for phpoffice/phpexcel

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload/Processing](./threats/malicious_file_uploadprocessing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted spreadsheet file (e.g., .xlsx, .xls, .csv) to the application. PHPSpreadsheet attempts to parse this file, and the malicious structure or content exploits a vulnerability in the library's parsing logic. This could involve manipulating file headers, cell data, or embedded objects within the PHPSpreadsheet's parsing process.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by causing the application to crash or consume excessive resources due to parsing errors or resource exhaustion within PHPSpreadsheet.
    *   Information Disclosure by allowing the attacker to read sensitive files or data on the server if the parsing vulnerability allows for arbitrary file access or memory leaks within PHPSpreadsheet.
*   **Affected Component:**  Parsing logic within various reader classes (e.g., `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Xlsx`, `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Xls`, `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Csv`). Specific functions involved in reading and interpreting file structures, data streams, and embedded objects within these reader classes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation on uploaded files, including file type and size restrictions, *before* passing the file to PHPSpreadsheet.
    *   Run PHPSpreadsheet processing in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions to mitigate the impact of successful exploitation of parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   Keep PHPSpreadsheet updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities in its parsing logic.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Parsing Logic](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_parsing_logic.md)

*   **Description:**  PHPSpreadsheet's code responsible for parsing different spreadsheet file formats might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, logic errors, use-after-free). An attacker could craft a specific file that triggers these vulnerabilities during the parsing process performed by PHPSpreadsheet.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities within PHPSpreadsheet could lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the PHP process or consuming excessive server resources during parsing.
    *   Information Disclosure from the server's memory if a parsing vulnerability allows for reading arbitrary memory locations within the PHPSpreadsheet process.
*   **Affected Component:**  Core parsing logic within the reader classes for various file formats (`\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\*`). This includes functions that handle file structure interpretation, data extraction, object instantiation, and memory management during the parsing process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep PHPSpreadsheet updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches addressing parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and changelogs related to PHPSpreadsheet for reported parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using static analysis security testing (SAST) tools specifically designed to identify vulnerabilities in PHP code, including potential issues within PHPSpreadsheet's codebase.
