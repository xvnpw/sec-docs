# Attack Surface Analysis for phpoffice/phpexcel

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Spreadsheet File Processing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_spreadsheet_file_processing.md)

*   **Description:**  The application processes user-uploaded or externally sourced spreadsheet files (XLS, XLSX, CSV, etc.). Maliciously crafted files can exploit vulnerabilities in PHPSpreadsheet's parsing logic.
*   **How PHPExcel Contributes:** PHPSpreadsheet is responsible for parsing and interpreting the structure and data within these files. Bugs or vulnerabilities in its parsing routines can be triggered by unexpected or malformed file structures.
*   **Example:** A user uploads an XLSX file with a deeply nested structure or an invalid header, causing PHPSpreadsheet to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive memory.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory), potentially crashing the application or server. In rare cases, could lead to code execution if a critical parsing vulnerability exists.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file size limits for uploaded spreadsheets.
    *   Use the latest stable version of PHPSpreadsheet, as updates often include bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Consider using PHPSpreadsheet's built-in validation methods where available, though these may not catch all malicious structures.
    *   Implement timeouts for file processing operations to prevent indefinite hangs.
    *   Run file processing in isolated environments or sandboxes if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Formula Injection](./attack_surfaces/formula_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious formulas into spreadsheet cells that, when processed by PHPSpreadsheet or later opened in a spreadsheet application, can execute unintended actions or reveal sensitive information.
*   **How PHPExcel Contributes:** PHPSpreadsheet parses and evaluates formulas within spreadsheet cells. If not properly sanitized or if vulnerabilities exist in the formula evaluation engine, malicious formulas can be processed.
*   **Example:** A user uploads a CSV file where a cell contains `=SYSTEM("rm -rf /")` (or an equivalent command for the target system). While PHPSpreadsheet itself might not execute this directly, if the application saves this data and it's later opened in a desktop spreadsheet application, the command could be executed.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the output is used in a context where formulas are evaluated (e.g., saved and opened in a spreadsheet application). Information disclosure if formulas can access and reveal sensitive data within the spreadsheet.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize user input before writing it to spreadsheet cells. Avoid directly embedding unsanitized user input into formulas.
    *   If possible, disable or restrict the use of dynamic or external functions within formulas when generating spreadsheets based on user input.
    *   Educate users about the risks of opening spreadsheets from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [External Entity (XXE) Injection (for XML-based formats like XLSX and ODS)](./attack_surfaces/external_entity__xxe__injection__for_xml-based_formats_like_xlsx_and_ods_.md)

*   **Description:**  If PHPSpreadsheet's XML parsing is not properly configured, attackers can inject malicious external entities into XLSX or ODS files, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service.
*   **How PHPExcel Contributes:** PHPSpreadsheet uses XML parsing libraries to process the internal structure of XLSX and ODS files. If these libraries are not configured to disable external entity processing, XXE vulnerabilities can arise.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts an XLSX file containing a malicious external entity definition that attempts to read local files on the server when the file is parsed by PHPSpreadsheet.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading arbitrary files on the server), Denial of Service (by referencing large external entities), potentially Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that PHPSpreadsheet's XML parsing is configured to disable external entity processing. This is often a setting within the underlying XML parser library (e.g., libxml).
    *   Use the latest versions of PHPSpreadsheet, as they may have improved default configurations or provide better control over XML parsing options.
