* **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Input Length
    * **Description:**  An attacker provides an extremely long email address (either the local-part or the domain) that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) during the validation process, potentially leading to a denial of service.
    * **How EmailValidator Contributes:** The library's parsing and validation logic might not have built-in safeguards against excessively long input strings, leading to resource exhaustion when processing them.
    * **Example:** Submitting an email address with a local-part consisting of tens of thousands of 'a' characters or a domain name exceeding typical limits.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the `EmailValidator` library is up-to-date, as newer versions might contain fixes for handling long inputs.
        * Consider if the library offers configuration options to limit the length of email components it processes.

* **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Regular Expression Complexity (ReDoS)
    * **Description:** If the `EmailValidator` relies on regular expressions for validation, a specially crafted email address can exploit vulnerabilities in those regexes, causing them to take an exponentially long time to process, leading to a DoS.
    * **How EmailValidator Contributes:**  Vulnerable regular expressions within the library's validation logic can be triggered by specific patterns in the input email address.
    * **Example:**  An email address with deeply nested comments or repeated patterns that cause the regex engine to backtrack excessively.
    * **Impact:**  Significant performance degradation or complete blockage of the validation process, potentially impacting the entire application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the `EmailValidator` library is up-to-date, as newer versions might contain fixes for ReDoS vulnerabilities or use more efficient regex.
        * If possible, review the library's source code or documentation to understand the complexity of its regular expressions.
