# Threat Model Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Threat: [Predictable or Weak Token Generation](./threats/predictable_or_weak_token_generation.md)

**Description:** If the `reset-password-bundle` uses a weak or predictable algorithm to generate password reset tokens, an attacker could attempt to guess valid tokens. They might use brute-force techniques or analyze patterns in generated tokens to predict tokens for other users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized password reset for arbitrary user accounts, leading to account takeover and potential data breaches or malicious activities performed under compromised accounts.

**Affected Component:** `TokenGenerator` service within the bundle, specifically the token generation function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure the `reset-password-bundle` is configured to use a cryptographically secure random number generator for token generation.
*   Regularly update the bundle to benefit from security patches and improvements in token generation algorithms.
*   Avoid customizing or overriding the default token generation logic with potentially weaker implementations.

## Threat: [Token Storage Vulnerabilities](./threats/token_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the `reset-password-bundle` stores password reset tokens insecurely in the database (e.g., in plain text or with weak encryption), a database compromise could expose these tokens. An attacker gaining access to the database could then use these exposed tokens to reset passwords for multiple user accounts.

**Impact:** Large-scale unauthorized password resets and potential account takeover affecting many or all users if the database is compromised and tokens are exposed.

**Affected Component:** `ResetPasswordRequest` entity and the database storage mechanism used by the application in conjunction with the bundle.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure the `reset-password-bundle` (and application configuration) stores tokens in a hashed or encrypted form at rest in the database.
*   Implement strong database security measures, including access control, encryption at rest for the entire database, and regular security audits to protect against database compromise.
*   Minimize the storage duration of reset tokens in the database. Implement a process to automatically delete used or expired tokens promptly.

## Threat: [Token Manipulation](./threats/token_manipulation.md)

**Description:** If the `reset-password-bundle`'s token validation process is flawed, an attacker might attempt to tamper with the password reset token, either in the URL or in storage. By manipulating the token's structure or content, they could try to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access to the password reset flow.

**Impact:** Potential authentication bypass and unauthorized password resets if token manipulation is successful, leading to account takeover for targeted user accounts.

**Affected Component:** `TokenGenerator` and `ResetPasswordHelper` services, specifically token generation and validation functions within the bundle.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Rely on the `reset-password-bundle`'s built-in token generation and validation mechanisms, which should be designed to prevent tampering (e.g., using cryptographic signing or MAC).
*   Avoid modifying or circumventing the bundle's core token handling logic unless absolutely necessary and after thorough security review by security experts.
*   Regularly update the bundle to benefit from security patches and improvements in token handling and validation processes.
