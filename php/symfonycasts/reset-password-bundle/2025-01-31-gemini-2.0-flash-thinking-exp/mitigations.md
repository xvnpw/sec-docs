# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Token Expiration](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_token_expiration.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (Developer):** Review the `config/packages/reset_password.yaml` file (or equivalent configuration location for the bundle).
    *   **Step 2 (Developer):** Locate the `lifetime` option under the `reset_password` configuration.
    *   **Step 3 (Developer):** Set a reasonable `lifetime` value in seconds.  Consider factors like user convenience and security sensitivity.
        *   **Example:** `lifetime: 3600` (1 hour) or `lifetime: 1800` (30 minutes).
    *   **Step 4 (Developer):** Document the chosen token expiration time for developers and security documentation.
    *   **Step 5 (Developer):** Consider adjusting the expiration time based on user feedback and security assessments over time.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Password Reset Token Compromise - Severity: High (if token lifetime is excessively long)
    *   Replay Attacks using Expired Tokens - Severity: Low (if token expiration is enforced)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Password Reset Token Compromise: Medium Reduction - Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a compromised token. The shorter the lifetime, the lower the risk.
    *   Replay Attacks using Expired Tokens: High Reduction - Prevents attackers from using expired tokens to gain unauthorized access.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Token expiration is configured in `config/packages/reset_password.yaml`. The current `lifetime` is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).

*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation. The current 1-hour expiration is a reasonable balance. However, periodically reviewing and potentially shortening the lifetime based on security best practices and risk assessments is recommended.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ensure Secure Token Generation (Bundle Default)](./mitigation_strategies/ensure_secure_token_generation__bundle_default_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (Developer - Verification):** Review the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` documentation and source code (specifically the token generation logic within the bundle).
    *   **Step 2 (Developer - Verification):** Confirm that the bundle utilizes a cryptographically secure random number generator (e.g., `random_bytes` in PHP) for token generation.
    *   **Step 3 (Developer - Verification):** Ensure your Symfony application is configured to use a secure session handler and that the underlying PHP environment is configured for secure random number generation.
    *   **Step 4 (Developer - Monitoring):** Periodically review bundle updates and security advisories to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced in token generation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Predictable Password Reset Tokens - Severity: Critical
    *   Brute-Force Token Guessing - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Predictable Password Reset Tokens: High Reduction - Using cryptographically secure tokens makes them virtually impossible to predict, eliminating this critical vulnerability.
    *   Brute-Force Token Guessing: High Reduction -  Secure tokens are resistant to brute-force guessing attempts due to their high entropy.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - The `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` is designed to use secure token generation by default. This is inherent in the bundle's code.

*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation within the bundle itself. However, it's crucial to ensure the underlying Symfony application and PHP environment are also configured securely to support secure random number generation. Regular checks and updates are necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Update the Bundle and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_update_the_bundle_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (Developer/DevOps):** Implement a process for regularly checking for updates to the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` and all other Symfony project dependencies (using tools like `composer outdated`).
    *   **Step 2 (Developer/DevOps):** Subscribe to security mailing lists or vulnerability databases relevant to Symfony and PHP to receive notifications about security advisories related to the bundle.
    *   **Step 3 (Developer/DevOps):**  Prioritize applying security updates promptly, especially for critical vulnerabilities in the bundle.
    *   **Step 4 (Developer/DevOps):**  Before updating, review release notes and changelogs of the bundle to understand the changes and potential impact of updates. Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.
    *   **Step 5 (Developer/DevOps):**  Document the update process and maintain a record of applied bundle updates for auditing and security tracking.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in the Bundle - Severity: High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High Reduction - Regularly updating the bundle is crucial to mitigate the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities within the bundle's code.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - There is a general process for updating dependencies, including Symfony components and bundles. However, the frequency and proactiveness of checking for updates specifically for security vulnerabilities in bundles could be improved.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  A more formalized and proactive process for security update management specifically for bundles should be implemented. This includes setting up automated checks for security advisories related to used bundles, establishing clear procedures for prioritizing and applying security updates, and regularly auditing bundle versions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Password Reset Email Content Carefully](./mitigation_strategies/customize_password_reset_email_content_carefully.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1 (Developer/Content Creator):** Review the default password reset email templates provided by the bundle.
    *   **Step 2 (Developer/Content Creator):** Customize the email content (within the bundle's template structure) to:
        *   Use clear and concise language.
        *   Maintain a professional tone and branding consistent with your application.
        *   Clearly identify the sender as your application.
        *   Explicitly state that the email is for a password reset request.
        *   Provide a clear and prominent password reset link (generated by the bundle).
        *   Include a security disclaimer advising users to be cautious of phishing and to verify the link destination.
        *   Avoid including sensitive user information directly in the email body (e.g., username, full name).
    *   **Step 3 (Developer/Content Creator):** Test the customized email templates across different email clients and devices to ensure proper rendering and functionality, especially the bundle-generated link.
    *   **Step 4 (Developer/Content Creator):** Regularly review and update email templates to maintain relevance and security best practices, ensuring compatibility with bundle updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Phishing Attacks (Reduced User Confusion and Increased Trust related to bundle emails) - Severity: Medium
    *   Social Engineering Attacks (Reduced User Vulnerability related to bundle emails) - Severity: Low

*   **Impact:**
    *   Phishing Attacks: Medium Reduction - Well-crafted and branded emails generated by the bundle help users distinguish legitimate password reset emails from phishing attempts.
    *   Social Engineering Attacks: Low Reduction - Clear and professional emails from the bundle can reduce user susceptibility to social engineering tactics that exploit password reset processes.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Password reset emails are customized to align with the application's branding and include basic instructions, leveraging the bundle's template customization features.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Password reset emails could be further enhanced with more explicit security disclaimers and advice on verifying link legitimacy within the bundle's template. Regular review of email content for clarity and security best practices should be implemented as a standard practice when updating the bundle or application.
