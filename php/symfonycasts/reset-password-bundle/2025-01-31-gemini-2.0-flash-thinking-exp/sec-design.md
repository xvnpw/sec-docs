# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle`, addresses the common business need for users to reset their passwords when they are forgotten or lost. This functionality is crucial for maintaining user access to web applications and services, directly impacting user satisfaction and reducing support requests related to password issues.

- Business Priorities:
  - Ensure users can regain access to their accounts efficiently and securely.
  - Minimize user frustration and support burden related to forgotten passwords.
  - Maintain a positive user experience by providing a straightforward password reset process.
  - Protect user accounts from unauthorized access during the password reset process.

- Business Goals:
  - Implement a reliable and user-friendly password reset feature within Symfony applications.
  - Reduce the number of user support tickets related to password recovery.
  - Enhance the security posture of user accounts by providing a secure password reset mechanism.

- Business Risks:
  - Account Takeover: Insecure password reset process could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
  - Data Breach: Vulnerabilities in the password reset mechanism could leak sensitive user information, such as email addresses or temporary tokens.
  - Service Disruption:  A malfunctioning or unavailable password reset feature can prevent users from accessing the application, leading to business disruption.
  - Reputational Damage: Security breaches or usability issues related to password reset can damage the organization's reputation and user trust.
  - Compliance Violations: Failure to implement secure password reset mechanisms may violate data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if personal data is compromised.

# SECURITY POSTURE

This Symfony bundle aims to provide a secure and robust password reset functionality. The security posture relies on secure software development practices within the Symfony ecosystem and the security features implemented within the bundle itself.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure Coding Practices: Symfony framework encourages secure coding practices, and the bundle is developed within this ecosystem. (Implemented by: Symfony framework and bundle developers)
  - security control: Dependency Management: Composer is used for dependency management, allowing for updates and security patches of underlying libraries. (Implemented by: Composer and Symfony ecosystem)
  - security control: Input Validation: Symfony framework provides tools for input validation, which are likely used within the bundle to validate user inputs like email addresses. (Implemented by: Symfony framework and bundle code)
  - security control: Cryptographic Token Generation: The bundle likely uses secure random number generation for creating password reset tokens. (Implemented by: Bundle code)
  - security control: HTTPS Enforcement: It is assumed that applications using this bundle will enforce HTTPS for all communication, protecting password reset requests in transit. (Implemented by: Application deployment configuration)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the bundle could introduce security risks. Mitigation relies on regular dependency updates.
  - accepted risk: Configuration Errors: Misconfiguration of the bundle or the application using it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Proper documentation and testing are needed to mitigate this.
  - accepted risk:  Zero-day Vulnerabilities:  Unforeseen vulnerabilities in the bundle or its dependencies could exist until discovered and patched.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning (SAST/DAST): Implement automated static and dynamic analysis security testing in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the bundle code and its configuration.
  - security control: Regular Dependency Updates: Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `composer audit` to identify vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Security Code Reviews: Conduct regular security code reviews of the bundle code to identify and address potential security flaws.
  - security control: Penetration Testing: Perform periodic penetration testing of applications using the bundle to assess the effectiveness of security controls and identify vulnerabilities in a realistic attack scenario.
  - security control: Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on the password reset request endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
  - security control:  Token Expiration: Ensure password reset tokens have a limited lifespan to reduce the window of opportunity for token reuse or theft.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The password reset process must reliably authenticate the user requesting the reset, ensuring only the legitimate account holder can reset the password.
    - Requirement: The system must prevent unauthorized password resets by malicious actors.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The password reset process must authorize the user to reset *their own* password and prevent them from resetting passwords of other users.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs, such as email addresses and reset tokens, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Email addresses must be validated to ensure they are in a valid format and potentially exist in the system's user database.
    - Requirement: Reset tokens must be validated to ensure they are correctly formatted, associated with a valid user, and not expired or already used.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Password reset tokens must be generated using cryptographically secure random number generators.
    - Requirement: Sensitive data, such as password reset tokens if stored, must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement: Communication during the password reset process, especially when submitting new passwords, must be protected using HTTPS.

# DESIGN

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - User Account Management: Specifically, the password recovery process is critical for user access and account security.
  - User Authentication: The password reset mechanism is an integral part of the user authentication system.

- Data to Protect:
  - User Email Addresses: Used for sending password reset links. Sensitivity: Personally Identifiable Information (PII), potentially sensitive.
  - Password Reset Tokens: Temporary, sensitive tokens used to verify password reset requests. Sensitivity: Highly sensitive, if compromised can lead to account takeover.
  - User Passwords (Hashed): While not directly handled by the reset process (except for updating the hash), the security of password hashes is indirectly related as the reset process allows users to change them. Sensitivity: Highly sensitive, critical for authentication security.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the specific deployment environment for the application using this bundle (cloud, on-premises, hybrid)?
  - What are the specific security compliance requirements for the application (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA)?
  - What email service provider will be used for sending password reset emails?
  - What database system will be used to store user data and reset tokens?
  - Are there any specific rate limiting or throttling requirements for the password reset functionality?
  - What is the expected lifespan of password reset tokens?
  - What level of security testing (penetration testing, security audits) is planned for the application?

- Assumptions:
  - The application using this bundle will enforce HTTPS for all communication.
  - The application will use a secure email service provider with proper email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) configured.
  - User passwords are stored securely using strong hashing algorithms provided by the Symfony framework.
  - The underlying Symfony framework and PHP runtime environment are kept up-to-date with security patches.
  - The application will be deployed in a reasonably secure infrastructure environment.
  - The development team follows secure coding practices.
