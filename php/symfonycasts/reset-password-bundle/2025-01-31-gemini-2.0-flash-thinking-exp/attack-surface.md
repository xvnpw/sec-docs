# Attack Surface Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Predictable Reset Token Generation](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_predictable_reset_token_generation.md)

*   **Description:** If reset tokens generated by the bundle are not cryptographically secure, predictable, or easily guessable, attackers can generate valid tokens without legitimate reset requests, gaining unauthorized password reset access.
*   **Bundle Contribution:** The security of token generation directly depends on the bundle's implementation. If it uses weak random number generators or predictable algorithms, it becomes a significant vulnerability introduced by the bundle.
*   **Example:** The bundle uses a simple timestamp-based token generation. An attacker analyzes the token structure and can predict future tokens based on the current time, allowing them to craft valid reset links for any user.
*   **Impact:** Account Takeover, Unauthorized Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Verify CSPRNG Usage:**  Ensure the `reset-password-bundle` utilizes a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for token generation. Review the bundle's code or documentation to confirm this.
        *   **Configuration Review:** If the bundle offers configuration options for token generation, choose the strongest and most secure settings.
        *   **Bundle Updates:** Keep the `reset-password-bundle` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements in token generation algorithms.
    *   **Users:** No direct user mitigation, this is a developer responsibility.

## Attack Surface: [Token Reuse](./attack_surfaces/token_reuse.md)

*   **Description:** If reset tokens are not properly invalidated by the bundle after they are used to reset a password, attackers can reuse a previously obtained token to reset the password again, even after the legitimate user has changed it.
*   **Bundle Contribution:** The bundle's logic for token invalidation upon successful password reset is crucial. A flaw in this mechanism, within the bundle's code, directly leads to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A user requests a password reset and receives a token generated by the bundle. They use the token to reset their password. However, the bundle fails to invalidate the token in the database. An attacker who intercepted the token earlier can now reuse it to reset the password again, potentially locking out the legitimate user.
*   **Impact:** Account Takeover, Unauthorized Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Verify Token Invalidation Logic:** Thoroughly test and verify that the `reset-password-bundle`'s implementation correctly and immediately invalidates reset tokens in the database after a successful password reset.
        *   **Database Integrity Checks:** Ensure the database schema and the bundle's logic correctly manage token status (e.g., used/unused, expired) to prevent reuse.
        *   **Code Audits:** Conduct code audits specifically focusing on the token invalidation process within the bundle's integration in your application.
    *   **Users:** No direct user mitigation, this is a developer responsibility.

## Attack Surface: [Token Lifetime Expiration Bypass](./attack_surfaces/token_lifetime_expiration_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** If the token expiration mechanism implemented by the bundle is flawed or bypassable, attackers can use expired tokens to reset passwords, defeating the intended security control of limiting token validity.
*   **Bundle Contribution:** The bundle's token expiration logic is a core security feature.  Vulnerabilities in its implementation, such as incorrect date/time handling or flawed comparison logic within the bundle, directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** The bundle uses a flawed date comparison logic for token expiration. An attacker discovers this flaw and crafts requests that exploit the incorrect logic, allowing them to use tokens that should be expired to successfully reset passwords.
*   **Impact:** Account Takeover, Unauthorized Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Rigorous Expiration Testing:** Thoroughly test the token expiration functionality provided by the `reset-password-bundle` with various scenarios, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and different time zones.
        *   **Review Date/Time Handling:** Carefully review the bundle's code related to date and time handling for token expiration to ensure robust and accurate comparisons, avoiding potential timezone issues or logical errors.
        *   **Configuration Scrutiny:**  If the bundle allows configuration of token lifetime, carefully consider the chosen duration, balancing security with usability, and ensure the configuration is correctly applied and enforced by the bundle.
    *   **Users:** No direct user mitigation, this is a developer responsibility.
