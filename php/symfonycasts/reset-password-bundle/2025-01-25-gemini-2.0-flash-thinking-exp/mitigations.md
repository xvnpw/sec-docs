# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Short Token Expiration Time](./mitigation_strategies/configure_short_token_expiration_time.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Short Password Reset Token Expiration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `reset_password.lifetime`:** In your `config/packages/reset_password.yaml` file (or equivalent configuration), adjust the `lifetime` setting for the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle`.
    2.  **Set a Shorter Duration:** Reduce the token expiration time to a more secure value, such as 15-30 minutes (e.g., `lifetime: 900` for 15 minutes in seconds). This setting directly controls the token validity period within the bundle.
    3.  **Communicate Expiration to Users:**  Inform users in the password reset email that the link is time-sensitive and will expire after a short period. While user communication isn't bundle-specific, it's a good practice related to the short expiration configured in the bundle.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Compromise (Medium Severity):** If a password reset email or token is intercepted, a shorter expiration window reduces the time an attacker has to use the token. This directly limits the window of vulnerability related to tokens generated by the bundle.
    *   **Replay Attacks (Low Severity):**  Older, expired tokens become unusable, preventing replay attacks where an attacker might try to reuse an old token. This is a direct consequence of the bundle's token expiration mechanism.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Compromise:** Medium reduction in risk. Reduces the window of opportunity for exploitation of compromised tokens generated by the bundle.
    *   **Replay Attacks:** High reduction in risk.  Effectively prevents replay attacks with expired tokens generated by the bundle.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, default value (likely longer than optimal)
*   **Missing Implementation:** Configuration review and adjustment in `reset_password.yaml` to set a shorter, more secure `lifetime` value within the bundle's configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Token Storage (Bundle Default Verification)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_token_storage__bundle_default_verification_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Token Storage Verification
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Bundle Documentation:** Consult the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` documentation to understand how it stores password reset tokens. The documentation should detail the storage mechanism (e.g., database table, encryption).
    2.  **Inspect Database Schema:** Examine the database schema used by the bundle to store reset request entities. Verify that the token field is not stored in plaintext. Ideally, it should be hashed or encrypted.
    3.  **Code Review (Optional):** If necessary, review the bundle's source code (specifically the parts related to token persistence) to confirm secure storage practices.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Database Breach - Token Exposure (High Severity):** If tokens are stored in plaintext and the database is compromised, attackers could gain access to valid password reset tokens and potentially take over accounts. Secure storage within the bundle mitigates this.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Database Breach - Token Exposure:** High reduction in risk.  Ensuring secure token storage within the bundle significantly reduces the impact of a database breach on password reset security.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Yes (Bundle is designed for secure storage)
*   **Missing Implementation:** Verification of secure storage configuration and practices within the project's specific implementation of the bundle. This involves documentation review and database inspection.
