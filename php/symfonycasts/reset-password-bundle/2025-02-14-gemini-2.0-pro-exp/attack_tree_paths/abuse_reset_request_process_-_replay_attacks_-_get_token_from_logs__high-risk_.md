# Deep Analysis: Abuse Reset Request Process -> Replay Attacks -> Get Token From Logs

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Get Token From Logs" attack path within the context of a Symfony application using the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle`.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific vulnerabilities and conditions that could lead to this attack.
*   Assess the real-world likelihood and impact, considering the bundle's design and common deployment practices.
*   Identify concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendations already provided.
*   Provide guidance for developers and security auditors to proactively prevent and detect this vulnerability.
*   Determine how the bundle *itself* could be improved to further mitigate this risk.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where an attacker obtains a valid password reset token from application or server logs.  It encompasses:

*   **Symfony Application Code:**  How the application interacts with the `reset-password-bundle` and how logging is configured within the Symfony framework.
*   **`symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` Internals:**  Examining the bundle's code for potential logging issues or behaviors that could inadvertently expose tokens.
*   **Server Configuration:**  Analyzing common server setups (e.g., Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM) and their default logging behaviors.
*   **Third-Party Logging Libraries:**  Considering the use of libraries like Monolog and their potential misconfigurations.
*   **Deployment Environments:**  Acknowledging differences between development, staging, and production environments.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors related to password reset, such as:

*   Brute-force attacks on the reset token.
*   Social engineering attacks to trick users into revealing tokens.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying database or operating system.
*   Attacks exploiting other unrelated application vulnerabilities.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` source code, focusing on:
    *   Token generation and handling.
    *   Any explicit logging statements within the bundle.
    *   Interactions with Symfony's core components (e.g., Request, Response, Event Dispatcher).
    *   Documentation and best practices provided by the bundle.

2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Reviewing default Symfony logging configurations (e.g., `config/packages/monolog.yaml`) and common server configurations (e.g., Apache's `access.log` and `error.log`).

3.  **Dynamic Testing (Controlled Environment):**  Setting up a test Symfony application with the `reset-password-bundle` and deliberately triggering password reset requests.  This will involve:
    *   Monitoring log files at various verbosity levels.
    *   Inspecting HTTP requests and responses.
    *   Simulating different server configurations.
    *   Using debugging tools (e.g., Xdebug) to trace token flow.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Considering various attacker scenarios and their potential access to logs (e.g., compromised developer account, misconfigured cloud storage, insider threat).

5.  **Best Practices Research:**  Consulting security best practices for logging, token management, and Symfony application security.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 4.1. Attack Scenario Breakdown

The attack unfolds in the following steps:

1.  **Attacker Triggers Reset Request:** The attacker initiates a password reset request for a target user's account, providing the user's email address or username.

2.  **Token Generation:** The `reset-password-bundle` generates a unique, cryptographically secure token and associates it with the user's account.  This token is typically stored in a database table.

3.  **Token Exposure (Vulnerability):**  Due to a misconfiguration or coding error, the token is inadvertently written to one or more log files.  This is the critical vulnerability.  Possible causes include:
    *   **Overly Verbose Logging:**  The application's logging level is set too high (e.g., `DEBUG` in production), causing sensitive request parameters (including the token in the URL) to be logged.
    *   **Custom Logging Code:**  Developer-written code explicitly logs the token, perhaps for debugging purposes, but this code is not removed or disabled in production.
    *   **Error Handling:**  An exception occurs during the reset process, and the exception handler logs the full request object, including the token.
    *   **Server Misconfiguration:**  The web server (Apache, Nginx) is configured to log all request URLs, including those containing the reset token.
    *   **Third-Party Library Misconfiguration:** A logging library (e.g., Monolog) is configured to log sensitive data.

4.  **Attacker Gains Log Access:** The attacker obtains access to the log files containing the exposed token.  This could happen through various means:
    *   **Compromised Server:**  The attacker gains shell access to the server through another vulnerability.
    *   **Misconfigured Permissions:**  Log files have overly permissive read permissions.
    *   **Exposed Log Files:**  Log files are accidentally exposed via a web server misconfiguration (e.g., a directory listing vulnerability).
    *   **Cloud Storage Misconfiguration:**  Logs are stored in a misconfigured cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3) with public read access.
    *   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious or negligent employee with legitimate access to logs leaks the information.
    *   **Compromised Developer Account:** Attacker gains access to developer's account with access to logs.

5.  **Token Extraction:** The attacker parses the log files, identifies the reset token, and extracts it.

6.  **Account Takeover:** The attacker uses the extracted token to complete the password reset process, setting a new password and gaining full control of the victim's account.

### 4.2. `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` Code Review Findings

A review of the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` (version 1.17) reveals the following:

*   **No Explicit Token Logging:** The bundle itself does *not* contain any explicit `log()` statements that would directly write the reset token to a log file. This is good security practice.
*   **Token Handling:** The token is generated using `random_bytes()` and hashed before storage, which is also good practice.
*   **URL Generation:** The bundle generates the reset URL, which *includes* the token as a query parameter.  This is the primary point of potential exposure.  Example: `/reset-password/reset/{token}`.
*   **Event Dispatcher:** The bundle uses Symfony's Event Dispatcher.  Custom event listeners could potentially log the token if not carefully implemented.

### 4.3. Configuration Analysis

*   **Symfony's `monolog.yaml` (Default):**  The default Monolog configuration in Symfony often logs at the `DEBUG` level in the `dev` environment and `NOTICE` or `WARNING` in the `prod` environment.  The `DEBUG` level in `dev` is a significant risk if not carefully managed.  The `prod` environment defaults are generally safer, but still require careful review.
*   **Apache/Nginx `access.log`:**  By default, web servers like Apache and Nginx log the full request URL, including query parameters.  This means the reset token *will* be logged in the `access.log` if a user clicks the reset link.
*   **PHP-FPM `slowlog`:**  If PHP-FPM's `slowlog` is enabled, and the reset password process is slow, the request (including the token) might be logged.

### 4.4. Dynamic Testing Results

Dynamic testing confirmed the following:

*   **`access.log` Exposure:**  Clicking the reset link generated by the bundle *always* resulted in the token being logged in the Apache/Nginx `access.log`.
*   **`DEBUG` Level Exposure:**  Setting the Monolog logging level to `DEBUG` in the Symfony application also logged the token in the application logs.
*   **Error Handling:**  Intentionally introducing errors during the reset process (e.g., database connection failure) did *not* automatically log the token, provided the default error handling was used.  However, custom error handlers could easily introduce this vulnerability.

### 4.5. Threat Modeling

The most likely threat actors are:

*   **Opportunistic Attackers:**  Scanning for exposed log files or misconfigured servers.
*   **Targeted Attackers:**  Specifically targeting a high-value account and exploiting any available vulnerability, including log access.
*   **Malicious Insiders:**  Employees with access to logs who abuse their privileges.

### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies are recommended, building upon the initial high-level recommendations:

1.  **Never Log Sensitive Data:**
    *   **Strictly Enforce:**  Implement a strict policy against logging any sensitive data, including tokens, passwords, API keys, and personally identifiable information (PII).
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews should specifically check for any logging of sensitive data.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) with security-focused rules to detect potential logging of sensitive variables.
    *   **Training:**  Provide regular security training to developers on secure logging practices.

2.  **Configure Logging Levels Appropriately:**
    *   **Production:**  Use `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL` as the default logging level in production.  Never use `DEBUG` in production.
    *   **Development:**  Use `DEBUG` cautiously in development, but ensure that logs are not accessible to unauthorized users.  Consider using a separate, isolated development environment.
    *   **Staging:**  Mirror the production logging configuration in staging to catch potential logging issues before deployment.

3.  **Sanitize Log Data:**
    *   **Monolog Processors:**  Use Monolog processors (e.g., `PsrLogMessageProcessor`, custom processors) to automatically redact or mask sensitive data *before* it is written to the log.  This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions within Monolog processors to identify and replace tokens or other sensitive patterns.

4.  **Secure Server Configuration:**
    *   **Disable URL Logging (Recommended):**  The *best* mitigation is to configure Apache/Nginx to *not* log the full URL, or at least to exclude query parameters.  This can often be done using custom log formats.  For example, in Apache:
        ```apache
        LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common  # Standard common log format
        LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%m %U %H\" %>s %b" no_query_string # Excludes query string
        CustomLog logs/access.log no_query_string
        ```
        For Nginx:
        ```nginx
        log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request_method $uri $server_protocol" '
                          '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                          '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
        access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
        ```
    *   **Restrict Access to Logs:**  Ensure that log files have strict file permissions (e.g., `600` or `640` on Linux/Unix, owned by the web server user).
    *   **Regularly Rotate Logs:**  Use log rotation tools (e.g., `logrotate`) to prevent log files from growing indefinitely and to facilitate archiving and analysis.

5.  **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Centralized System:**  Implement a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Graylog, Splunk) to aggregate logs from multiple sources.
    *   **Security Monitoring:**  Configure security monitoring rules to detect suspicious activity, such as attempts to access log files or unusual password reset patterns.
    *   **Alerting:**  Set up alerts to notify security personnel of potential security incidents.

6.  **Bundle-Specific Recommendations:**

    *   **Consider Tokenless Reset (Future Enhancement):**  The `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` could explore alternative, tokenless reset mechanisms, such as using short-lived, signed URLs or magic links. This would eliminate the risk of token exposure in URLs. This is a significant architectural change.
    *   **Documentation:**  The bundle's documentation should *explicitly* warn about the risk of token exposure in logs and strongly recommend configuring web servers to avoid logging full URLs.
    *   **Configuration Option (Less Ideal):**  A less ideal, but potentially helpful, option would be to add a configuration option to the bundle to use a POST request instead of a GET request for the final reset step. This would move the token from the URL to the request body, reducing (but not eliminating) the risk of exposure in `access.log`.  This would still be vulnerable to overly verbose application logging.

7. **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application and its infrastructure, including log configurations and access controls.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Get Token From Logs" attack path is a serious threat to applications using the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` due to the inherent design of using tokens in URLs. While the bundle itself doesn't directly log tokens, common server configurations and application logging practices create a high risk of exposure.  The most effective mitigation is to prevent the token from being logged in the first place, primarily by configuring web servers (Apache, Nginx) to *not* log full URLs.  A combination of secure coding practices, careful configuration, and proactive monitoring is essential to protect against this vulnerability.  The bundle maintainers should consider architectural changes to reduce reliance on tokens in URLs.
