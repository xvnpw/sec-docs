# Project Design Document: Symfonycasts Reset Password Bundle

## BUSINESS POSTURE

_Priorities and Goals:_

*   Provide a secure and user-friendly mechanism for users to reset their forgotten passwords within Symfony applications.
*   Minimize the risk of account takeover through vulnerabilities in the password reset process.
*   Offer a customizable and extensible solution that integrates well with existing Symfony projects.
*   Reduce development time for implementing password reset functionality.
*   Maintain a high level of code quality and security.

_Business Risks:_

*   Account takeover due to vulnerabilities in the password reset flow (e.g., predictable tokens, insufficient token expiration, lack of rate limiting).
*   Exposure of sensitive user data (e.g., email addresses) during the reset process.
*   Non-compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) related to personal data handling.
*   Negative user experience due to a complex or unreliable password reset process.
*   Reputational damage resulting from security breaches related to password resets.

## SECURITY POSTURE

_Existing Security Controls:_

*   security control: Generation of cryptographically secure random tokens for password reset requests (described in bundle's code and documentation).
*   security control: Time-limited validity of reset tokens (configurable, described in documentation).
*   security control: Storage of token hashes rather than plain text tokens in the database (described in bundle's code and documentation).
*   security control: Throttling of password reset requests to mitigate brute-force attacks (configurable, described in documentation).
*   security control: Use of Symfony's security features and best practices (inherent in the framework and encouraged in the documentation).
*   security control: Email-based token delivery, leveraging Symfony's mailer component (described in bundle's code and documentation).

_Accepted Risks:_

*   accepted risk: Reliance on the underlying Symfony framework's security mechanisms.
*   accepted risk: Dependence on the security of the email delivery system.
*   accepted risk: Potential for user error (e.g., weak new passwords) after a successful reset.

_Recommended Security Controls:_

*   security control: Implement stricter password complexity requirements during the new password setting phase.
*   security control: Consider adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional layer of security, especially after a password reset.
*   security control: Provide clear and concise security guidance in the documentation, emphasizing the importance of secure configuration and deployment.
*   security control: Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious password reset activity.
*   security control: Regularly audit the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.

_Security Requirements:_

*   Authentication:
    *   The system must securely authenticate users before allowing them to change their password. This is achieved through the validation of the unique, time-limited reset token.
    *   The system must verify that the reset token has not expired.
    *   The system must ensure that the reset token belongs to the user attempting to reset the password.

*   Authorization:
    *   Only users with a valid, unexpired reset token should be authorized to change their password.
    *   The system should prevent unauthorized access to the password reset functionality.

*   Input Validation:
    *   The system must validate all user inputs, including email addresses and new passwords.
    *   New passwords must meet defined complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, character types).
    *   Input validation should be performed on both the client-side (for user experience) and server-side (for security).

*   Cryptography:
    *   The system must use cryptographically secure random number generators for token generation.
    *   Password reset tokens should be hashed before being stored in the database.
    *   The system should use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for storing user passwords.

### BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits code" --> GitRepo["Git Repository (e.g., GitHub)"]
    GitRepo -- "Webhook trigger" --> CI["CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- "Runs tests" --> Tests["Unit/Integration Tests"]
    CI -- "Performs SAST" --> SAST["SAST Scanner (e.g., Symfony Insight)"]

    DockerBuild -- "Pushes image" --> Registry["Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR)"]
    Registry -- "Provides image for deployment" --> Kubernetes["Kubernetes Deployment"]

```

_Build Process Description:_

1.  Developer commits code changes to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  A webhook triggers the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI pipeline runs unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
4.  The CI pipeline performs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using a tool like Symfony Insight to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
5.  If tests and SAST pass, the CI pipeline builds a Docker image for the application.
6.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).
7.  The Kubernetes deployment pulls the image from the registry and deploys it to the cluster.

_Security Controls:_

*   security control: Code review before merging changes to the main branch.
*   security control: Automated unit and integration tests to catch bugs and regressions.
*   security control: SAST scanning to identify security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Use of a minimal base image for the Docker container to reduce the attack surface.
*   security control: Running the application as a non-root user within the container.
*   security control: Image security scanning in the container registry to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Secure storage of secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials) using Kubernetes secrets or a secrets management solution.
*   security control: Regularly updating dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

_Critical Business Processes:_

*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Password reset functionality.
*   User data management.

_Data to Protect and Sensitivity:_

*   User email addresses (Personally Identifiable Information - PII, Medium sensitivity).
*   Password reset tokens (High sensitivity, as they grant temporary access).
*   Hashed user passwords (High sensitivity, although protected by hashing).
*   Any other user data stored by the application (Sensitivity depends on the specific data).

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

_Questions:_

*   What specific database system is being used?
*   What email service provider is being used?
*   Are there any existing security policies or compliance requirements that need to be considered?
*   What is the expected volume of password reset requests?
*   What is the desired level of customization for the password reset flow?
*   Are there any specific logging or monitoring requirements?

_Assumptions:_

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization has a moderate risk appetite and prioritizes security, but also needs a functional and user-friendly solution.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The underlying Symfony framework and its security components are properly configured and maintained. The email service provider is secure and reliable.
*   DESIGN: The application uses a relational database. A third-party email service is used for sending emails. The deployment environment is a Kubernetes cluster. The build process uses a CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and SAST scanning.
