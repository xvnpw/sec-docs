# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Mitigation Strategy: [Short Token Lifetimes](./mitigation_strategies/short_token_lifetimes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review bundle configuration:**  Check the `config/packages/reset_password.yaml` (or equivalent configuration file) for the `lifetime` setting of the `symfonycasts_reset_password` bundle.
    2.  **Set a short lifetime:**  Adjust the `lifetime` value to the shortest practical duration.  Consider values like 3600 (1 hour), 1800 (30 minutes), or even shorter, depending on your user base and security requirements.  This is a direct configuration of the bundle.
    3.  **Update user documentation:**  Clearly inform users about the token expiration time in your application's help documentation, FAQs, and within the password reset email itself.
    4.  **Test expiration:**  Manually test the token expiration functionality by requesting a reset, waiting longer than the configured lifetime, and then attempting to use the token.  Verify that it is rejected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Brute-Forcing (Medium Severity):**  Significantly reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to successfully brute-force a token.
    *   **Token Reuse (if intercepted) (Medium Severity):** Limits the time an intercepted token remains valid.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Token Brute-Forcing:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Token Reuse:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in `config/packages/reset_password.yaml`.  The current lifetime is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.  The current implementation is considered adequate, but could be reviewed periodically.

## Mitigation Strategy: [One-Time Use Tokens](./mitigation_strategies/one-time_use_tokens.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Verify bundle behavior:** The `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` *should* invalidate tokens after a successful password reset by default. This is a core feature of the bundle.  However, *verify* this behavior through testing and code review.  Don't solely rely on documentation.
    2.  **Check token invalidation logic (within the bundle):** While you shouldn't modify the bundle's internal code directly, you *can* and *should* review the bundle's source code (on GitHub or in your `vendor` directory) to understand *how* it handles token invalidation.  Look for the database interaction where the token is marked as used or deleted. This is about understanding, not modifying, the bundle's core functionality.
    3. **Test thoroughly:** Request a password reset, successfully change the password, and then attempt to use the same token again. Verify that it is rejected. This confirms the bundle's expected behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Replay Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents an attacker from using a valid token multiple times.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented (by default behavior of the bundle).  Verification through testing is crucial.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None, assuming testing confirms the expected behavior. The key here is *verification* that the bundle is behaving as designed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ensure Strong Randomness (Relating to Bundle's Token Generation)](./mitigation_strategies/ensure_strong_randomness__relating_to_bundle's_token_generation_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Verify Bundle's Dependency:** The `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` relies on PHP's `random_bytes()` function for generating cryptographically secure random tokens. This function, in turn, depends on the underlying operating system's secure random number generator.
    2.  **Check System Randomness Source:** On Linux systems, ensure that `/dev/urandom` is available and accessible to the PHP process. This is the preferred source of randomness for `random_bytes()`. While not a direct bundle configuration, it *directly impacts* the security of the tokens generated *by* the bundle.
    3.  **Update System Libraries:** Regularly update your operating system and PHP to the latest versions to benefit from any security patches and improvements in random number generation. This ensures that `random_bytes()` is using the most secure available methods.
    4. **Monitor System Entropy (Linux):** On Linux, you can monitor the available entropy using `cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail`. Low entropy can lead to weaker random number generation. Consider using tools like `rngd` to replenish entropy if needed. This is a proactive measure to ensure the quality of randomness used *by* the bundle.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Token Prediction (High Severity):** If the underlying random number generator is weak (due to system misconfiguration or low entropy), the reset tokens generated *by the bundle* could become predictable.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Token Prediction:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially Implemented. The server is running an up-to-date Linux distribution and PHP version. However, proactive monitoring of system entropy is not in place.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement monitoring of system entropy (e.g., using a monitoring tool or a custom script) and configure alerts for low entropy levels. This ensures the *environment* in which the bundle operates is providing strong randomness.
