# Threat Model Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Threat: [Token Leakage via Logging](./threats/token_leakage_via_logging.md)

*   **Threat:** Token Leakage via Logging

    *   **Description:** The application accidentally logs the *raw* reset tokens (not the hashed version). An attacker with access to the logs (e.g., through a compromised server, misconfigured log access) could then use these tokens directly.  This is a configuration issue *directly related* to how the bundle's output is handled.
    *   **Impact:** Direct, unauthorized account access. The attacker can immediately reset the password without needing to crack a hash.
    *   **Affected Component:** Application logging configuration (specifically, how it handles data generated by the `ResetPasswordHelper` and related components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** *Never* log the raw reset tokens. Audit the application's logging configuration and ensure sensitive data, especially output from the bundle, is excluded. Implement strict access controls on log files.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attacks on Reset Token Submission](./threats/brute-force_attacks_on_reset_token_submission.md)

*   **Threat:** Brute-Force Attacks on Reset Token Submission

    *   **Description:** An attacker repeatedly submits requests to the password reset *submission* endpoint (where the token is entered), trying different token values. The bundle does *not* inherently rate-limit this endpoint, making it a direct vulnerability related to the bundle's implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized account access if the attacker guesses a valid token.
    *   **Affected Component:** The controller action handling the password reset form submission (where the token, provided by the bundle, is validated). This is a direct interaction point with the bundle.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement rate limiting on the password reset *submission* endpoint. This is *essential* and is *not* provided by the bundle for this specific endpoint. Use Symfony's rate limiting features or a dedicated security component. Monitor for a high volume of failed reset attempts.

## Threat: [Replay Attack](./threats/replay_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Replay Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts a valid reset token and reuses it *after* the legitimate user has already used it. While prevention relies on HTTPS (a general concern), the bundle's responsibility is to ensure single-use tokens. A failure here is a direct bundle issue.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access. The attacker can reset the password again.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ResetPasswordHelper::removeResetRequest()` and the logic that marks a token as used (or removes it) within the bundle. This is entirely within the bundle's control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Ensure the bundle's mechanism for invalidating tokens after a single use is functioning correctly. Rigorously test this functionality, including edge cases and concurrent requests.

## Threat: [CSRF on password reset form](./threats/csrf_on_password_reset_form.md)

* **Threat:** CSRF on password reset form.
    * **Description:** Attacker creates a malicious website that includes a hidden form that submits a password reset request to the application. If a logged-in user visits the malicious website, their browser will automatically submit the form, potentially resetting their password without their knowledge.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized password reset, potentially leading to account takeover.
    * **Affected Component:** The password reset form (specifically, the lack of CSRF protection).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Ensure that the password reset form is protected by a CSRF token. Symfony forms are protected by default, but verify this configuration.
