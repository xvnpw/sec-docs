# Threat Model Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Threat: [Predictable Reset Tokens](./threats/predictable_reset_tokens.md)

**Description:** An attacker could analyze the token generation mechanism within the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` and identify patterns or weaknesses, allowing them to predict valid reset tokens for other users. They might then use this predicted token to directly access the password reset form and set a new password for the targeted account without needing access to the user's email.

**Impact:** Complete account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential misuse of the account.

**Affected Component:** `TokenGenerator` service within the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` is configured to use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for token generation.
*   Verify that the token length and character set configured within the bundle provide sufficient entropy to resist brute-force and prediction attempts.
*   Regularly update the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` to benefit from security patches that might address weaknesses in token generation.

## Threat: [Insufficient Token Entropy](./threats/insufficient_token_entropy.md)

**Description:** Even if not fully predictable, tokens generated by the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` with low entropy (not enough randomness) can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks. An attacker could attempt to guess valid tokens by making a large number of requests to the password reset verification endpoint with different token values.

**Impact:** Account takeover, although potentially requiring more effort than predicting tokens.

**Affected Component:** `TokenGenerator` service within the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` to generate tokens with a sufficiently long length and a diverse character set.
*   Implement rate limiting on the password reset verification endpoint to slow down or block brute-force attempts against the tokens generated by the bundle.

## Threat: [Token Reuse](./threats/token_reuse.md)

**Description:** If the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle` doesn't properly invalidate tokens after they have been used to reset a password, an attacker who intercepts a valid token could potentially use it multiple times to reset the password repeatedly, even after the legitimate user has changed it.

**Impact:** Repeated and unauthorized password changes, potentially leading to denial of access for the legitimate user.

**Affected Component:** `ResetPasswordRequestRepository` and the logic for marking tokens as used within the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the `symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle`'s configuration correctly invalidates tokens upon successful password reset.
*   Avoid overriding or customizing the bundle's token invalidation logic without careful security review.
