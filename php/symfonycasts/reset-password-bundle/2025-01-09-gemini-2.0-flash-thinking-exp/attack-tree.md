## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Reset Password Bundle [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_reset_password_bundle__critical_node_.md)

* This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success in any of the high-risk paths below leads to this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weakness in Reset Password Process [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weakness_in_reset_password_process__critical_node_.md)

* This node signifies the core of the attack, targeting vulnerabilities within the bundle's functionality. It encompasses all the high-risk paths detailed below.

## Attack Tree Path: [Token Manipulation/Prediction [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/token_manipulationprediction__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Predictable Token Generation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the algorithm or method used to generate reset tokens is flawed or uses predictable inputs (e.g., sequential numbers, timestamps without sufficient entropy), an attacker can potentially predict valid tokens for other users without needing to initiate a password reset for their account.
    * **Example:** If tokens are generated using a simple incrementing counter, an attacker could easily guess the next valid token.
    * **Mitigation Focus:** Ensure the bundle uses a cryptographically secure random number generator for token creation. The token should have sufficient length and randomness to make prediction computationally infeasible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Token Reuse (If Not Properly Invalidated) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/token_reuse__if_not_properly_invalidated___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the bundle does not properly invalidate reset tokens after they have been used to reset a password or after a reasonable time limit, an attacker who has previously intercepted a reset link or initiated a reset for a target user might be able to use the same token multiple times to gain unauthorized access.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts a reset link intended for a victim. The victim doesn't use it immediately. The attacker uses the link to reset the password. If the token isn't invalidated, the attacker could potentially use the *same* link again later.
    * **Mitigation Focus:** Implement immediate token invalidation upon successful password reset. Implement a reasonable expiration time (TTL) for reset tokens, after which they are no longer valid.

## Attack Tree Path: [Link Interception/Theft [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/link_interceptiontheft__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Access Target User's Email Account [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If an attacker can gain access to the target user's email account, they can directly retrieve the password reset link sent to the user. This bypasses the need to exploit vulnerabilities within the reset password bundle itself, but is a critical path to compromise the application through the reset mechanism.
    * **Example:** An attacker successfully phishes the target user's email credentials or exploits a vulnerability in the user's email provider.
    * **Mitigation Focus (Application Level - Indirect):** While the application cannot directly control email security, encouraging users to use strong, unique passwords and enabling two-factor authentication on their email accounts can significantly reduce the likelihood of this attack vector. From the application's perspective, ensure sensitive information isn't unnecessarily exposed in emails and consider alternative verification methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Target User's Email Account [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/access_target_user's_email_account__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If an attacker can gain access to the target user's email account, they can directly retrieve the password reset link sent to the user. This bypasses the need to exploit vulnerabilities within the reset password bundle itself, but is a critical path to compromise the application through the reset mechanism.
    * **Example:** An attacker successfully phishes the target user's email credentials or exploits a vulnerability in the user's email provider.
