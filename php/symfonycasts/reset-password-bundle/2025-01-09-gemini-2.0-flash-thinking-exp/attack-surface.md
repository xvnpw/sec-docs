# Attack Surface Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Token Predictability/Weak Randomness](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_token_predictabilityweak_randomness.md)

**Description:** If the password reset token generation process uses a weak or predictable algorithm, attackers might be able to guess valid reset tokens for other users.

**How Reset-Password-Bundle Contributes:** The bundle handles the generation of these tokens. If the underlying implementation doesn't use cryptographically secure random number generation, it introduces this vulnerability.

**Example:** Tokens are generated using a simple sequential counter or a timestamp with insufficient entropy. An attacker observes a valid token and can predict the tokens for other users based on this pattern.

**Impact:** Complete account takeover without needing the user's current password.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Ensure the bundle is configured to use a cryptographically secure random number generator for token generation.
    * Verify that the token length is sufficient to prevent brute-force attacks. The bundle likely has default settings, but developers should review them.
    * Regularly update the bundle to benefit from any security improvements or fixes.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Token Lifetime Issues](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_token_lifetime_issues.md)

**Description:**  Tokens with excessively long lifetimes or a lack of single-use enforcement increase the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit compromised tokens.

**How Reset-Password-Bundle Contributes:** The bundle defines the lifespan of the generated tokens and how they are validated. Incorrect configuration or implementation can lead to these issues.

**Example:** A reset token remains valid for several days. A user requests a reset but doesn't complete it immediately. An attacker intercepts the token during this period and can use it to reset the password later. Or, a token can be used multiple times if not invalidated after the first use.

**Impact:** Account takeover if a token is intercepted. Reusing tokens can allow persistent access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Configure a reasonably short expiration time for password reset tokens. Consider the balance between user convenience and security.
    * Ensure the application invalidates the reset token immediately after it's successfully used to change the password.
    * Implement checks to prevent the reuse of already used tokens.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Confirmation Bypassing Token Verification](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_confirmation_bypassing_token_verification.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the application's logic could allow an attacker to submit a new password without providing a valid or any reset token.

**How Reset-Password-Bundle Contributes:** While the bundle provides the verification mechanism, incorrect implementation or integration by the application developer can lead to this bypass.

**Example:** The application's password reset confirmation form doesn't properly check for the presence and validity of the token before allowing the password change. An attacker might be able to directly submit a password change request to the endpoint.

**Impact:** Complete account takeover without needing the user's current password or a valid reset token.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Strictly enforce token verification on the password reset confirmation endpoint. Ensure the token is present, valid, and not expired.
    * Do not rely solely on front-end validation. Implement robust server-side validation.
    * Follow the bundle's documentation and best practices for integrating the reset password functionality.
