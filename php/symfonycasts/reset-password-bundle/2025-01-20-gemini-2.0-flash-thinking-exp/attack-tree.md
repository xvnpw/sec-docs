## Attack Tree Path: [Attack: Gain Unauthorized Access to User Account](./attack_tree_paths/attack_gain_unauthorized_access_to_user_account.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Compromising this node means the attacker has successfully gained control of a user account.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reset Token Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reset_token_vulnerability.md)

This node represents a fundamental weakness in the reset token mechanism. If this node is compromised, it opens up multiple avenues for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR (under Exploit Reset Token Vulnerability)](./attack_tree_paths/or__under_exploit_reset_token_vulnerability_.md)

This signifies that there are multiple ways to exploit the reset token vulnerability, making it a critical point of failure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Valid Reset Token for Target User](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_valid_reset_token_for_target_user.md)

If an attacker can obtain a legitimate reset token intended for the victim, they can bypass a significant portion of the security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Token Validation](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_token_validation.md)

If the token validation process can be circumvented, the attacker can reset the password even without a valid or legitimate token.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reset Token Vulnerability -> Obtain Valid Reset Token for Target User -> Trick User into Revealing Token (Social Engineering)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reset_token_vulnerability_-_obtain_valid_reset_token_for_target_user_-_trick_user_into_revea_e33ac1bd.md)

*   This path describes a phishing attack where the attacker crafts a deceptive message (e.g., email) to trick the user into clicking a malicious link or providing their reset token.
    *   The likelihood is medium-high because social engineering attacks are common and often successful.
    *   The impact is high as it directly leads to the attacker obtaining a valid reset token.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reset Token Vulnerability -> Bypass Token Validation -> Exploit Token Predictability/Weak Randomness](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reset_token_vulnerability_-_bypass_token_validation_-_exploit_token_predictabilityweak_rando_8bfb6abf.md)

*   This path involves the attacker analyzing the token generation algorithm used by the application. If the algorithm is predictable or uses weak randomness, the attacker can potentially guess or generate valid reset tokens for other users.
    *   The likelihood is low-medium, depending on the sophistication of the token generation.
    *   The impact is high, as it allows the attacker to potentially reset the passwords of multiple users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reset Request Mechanism -> Exploit Lack of Rate Limiting on Reset Requests](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reset_request_mechanism_-_exploit_lack_of_rate_limiting_on_reset_requests.md)

*   This path focuses on abusing the reset request functionality. If the application doesn't implement proper rate limiting, an attacker can send numerous reset requests for a target user.
    *   While the direct impact is typically low-medium (annoyance, potential resource exhaustion), it can be a precursor to other attacks or disrupt the user's experience.
    *   The likelihood is medium-high if rate limiting is not implemented.
