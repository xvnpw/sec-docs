# Threat Model Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Threat: [Predictable or easily guessable reset request tokens](./threats/predictable_or_easily_guessable_reset_request_tokens.md)

**Description:** The reset request tokens generated by the bundle are not sufficiently random or are based on predictable patterns (e.g., sequential numbers, timestamps with low entropy). An attacker could potentially guess valid tokens without initiating a reset request.

**Impact:** Unauthorized password reset, leading to account takeover.

**Affected Component:** Token Generation Service (responsible for creating the reset token).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the bundle utilizes a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for token generation. Verify the token length and entropy are sufficient. Regularly review the token generation logic.

## Threat: [Replay attacks on reset request tokens](./threats/replay_attacks_on_reset_request_tokens.md)

**Description:** A reset request token is intercepted by an attacker (e.g., through network sniffing or compromised email). If the token remains valid after the password has been successfully reset or after a reasonable time, the attacker could reuse the intercepted token to initiate another password reset for the same account.

**Impact:** Unauthorized password reset, leading to account takeover.

**Affected Component:** Token Validation and Invalidation Logic (responsible for checking and managing the lifecycle of the token).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Invalidate reset request tokens immediately after they have been used successfully. Implement a short expiration time for reset request tokens, even if not used.

## Threat: [Lack of proper token expiration](./threats/lack_of_proper_token_expiration.md)

**Description:** Reset request tokens have an excessively long lifespan. This increases the window of opportunity for an attacker to exploit a leaked or intercepted token, even if the user is unaware of the compromise for an extended period.

**Impact:** Unauthorized password reset, leading to account takeover.

**Affected Component:** Token Expiration Configuration (settings defining how long tokens remain valid).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Configure a reasonable and short expiration time for reset request tokens. The default should be reviewed and adjusted based on the application's risk profile.

## Threat: [Insecure storage of reset request tokens](./threats/insecure_storage_of_reset_request_tokens.md)

**Description:** The storage mechanism for reset request tokens (e.g., database) is compromised. Attackers gain access to the stored tokens and can use them to directly access the password reset confirmation process without needing to intercept emails.

**Impact:** Widespread unauthorized password resets, leading to mass account takeover.

**Affected Component:** Token Storage Mechanism (database entity, repository, or service responsible for storing tokens).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the database or storage mechanism used by the bundle is properly secured with strong access controls and encryption at rest. Consider encrypting the reset request tokens themselves within the storage.

## Threat: [Reset link manipulation](./threats/reset_link_manipulation.md)

**Description:** The structure of the reset link is predictable or lacks sufficient integrity protection. An attacker might be able to modify parts of the link (e.g., user ID) to target a different user account.

**Impact:** Unauthorized password reset for unintended accounts, leading to account takeover.

**Affected Component:** Reset Link Generation Logic (how the URL containing the token is constructed).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the reset link includes a secure, unpredictable token that is validated against the stored token. Avoid including easily guessable user identifiers directly in the link. Use signed URLs or HMAC to ensure the integrity of the link parameters.

## Threat: [Account takeover through leaked reset token](./threats/account_takeover_through_leaked_reset_token.md)

**Description:** A reset token is leaked through various means (e.g., browser history, shared computer, shoulder surfing). An attacker who obtains this token can directly access the password reset confirmation form and set a new password for the account without needing to compromise the user's email.

**Impact:** Unauthorized password reset, leading to account takeover.

**Affected Component:** Token Validation Logic, Reset Password Confirmation Action.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Emphasize the importance of keeping reset links confidential. Implement short expiration times for reset tokens. Consider displaying a warning message on the reset password form about the sensitivity of the link.

## Threat: [Developer misuse of the bundle](./threats/developer_misuse_of_the_bundle.md)

**Description:** Developers incorrectly implement or integrate the bundle into the application, leading to vulnerabilities. Examples include failing to properly validate the token before allowing password reset, not invalidating the token after use.

**Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the specific misuse, potentially leading to unauthorized password resets and account takeovers.

**Affected Component:** Integration Points (where the bundle's services and controllers are used within the application's code).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the misuse).

**Mitigation Strategies:** Provide clear and comprehensive documentation with secure coding examples. Encourage developers to follow best practices when integrating the bundle. Provide security guidelines and conduct code reviews to identify potential misuse.
