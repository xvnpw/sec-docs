# Attack Surface Analysis for symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle

## Attack Surface: [Predictable or Brute-forceable Password Reset Tokens](./attack_surfaces/predictable_or_brute-forceable_password_reset_tokens.md)

*   **Description:** The password reset token generated by the bundle might be predictable due to a weak random number generator or insufficient entropy, or an attacker might attempt to brute-force the token.
    *   **How `reset-password-bundle` contributes:** The bundle is responsible for generating these tokens. The security of the token generation process directly impacts this attack surface. The configuration of the token's lifetime also plays a role.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could analyze the token generation pattern and write a script to generate potential valid tokens for a user, eventually guessing a valid one and gaining access to the password reset form.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized password reset, leading to account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the bundle (and underlying Symfony framework) uses a cryptographically secure random number generator for token creation.
        *   Configure a sufficiently long and unpredictable token length.
        *   Implement rate limiting on the token verification endpoint to slow down brute-force attempts (though this is more of an application-level concern).
        *   Regularly review and update the bundle to benefit from security improvements.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Link Exposure/Interception](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_link_exposureinterception.md)

*   **Description:** The password reset link sent via email could be intercepted by an attacker if the communication channel (email) is not secure or if the user's email account is compromised.
    *   **How `reset-password-bundle` contributes:** The bundle generates the URL containing the token. The longer the token's validity period, the greater the window of opportunity for interception.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the email containing the password reset link through a man-in-the-middle attack or by gaining access to the user's email account. They can then use the link to reset the password.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized password reset, leading to account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for the entire application to protect the communication channel.
        *   Advise users on the importance of securing their email accounts.
        *   Implement short expiration times for password reset tokens using the bundle's configuration (`lifetime`).
        *   Consider adding a confirmation step after the user clicks the link but before displaying the reset password form (though this adds complexity).

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Token Reuse](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_token_reuse.md)

*   **Description:** A successfully used password reset token might not be invalidated properly, allowing an attacker to reuse it to reset the password again.
    *   **How `reset-password-bundle` contributes:** The bundle's logic for invalidating tokens after a successful password reset is crucial. If this logic is flawed, tokens could be reused.
    *   **Example:** A user successfully resets their password using a link. An attacker who previously intercepted the same link tries to use it again and is unexpectedly able to reset the password once more.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized password reset, potentially allowing an attacker to regain access to an account even after the legitimate user has changed the password.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the bundle's configuration and usage correctly invalidate the `ResetPasswordRequest` entity after a successful password reset.
        *   Review the bundle's code or documentation to understand the token invalidation mechanism.
        *   Test the password reset functionality thoroughly to confirm token invalidation.
