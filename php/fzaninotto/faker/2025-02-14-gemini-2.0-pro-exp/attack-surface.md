# Attack Surface Analysis for fzaninotto/faker

## Attack Surface: [Predictable Data Generation for Security-Sensitive Purposes](./attack_surfaces/predictable_data_generation_for_security-sensitive_purposes.md)

*   **Description:**  Using `faker` to generate data that is intended to be secret or unpredictable, such as tokens, keys, or passwords.
*   **How `faker` Contributes:** `faker` is designed for generating *realistic-looking* data, not cryptographically secure data.  Its default seeding or predictable seeds make the output guessable.
*   **Example:**  A password reset feature uses `faker.password()` to generate the reset token, and the application uses a default or easily guessable seed.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can predict the generated tokens/keys/passwords and gain unauthorized access to accounts or resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never use `faker` for generating security-sensitive data in production.**
    *   Use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSRNGs) like Python's `secrets` module for tokens, keys, and passwords.
    *   If `faker` is used in a non-production, publicly accessible environment (strongly discouraged), ensure a truly random, unpredictable, and non-reusable seed is used for *each* generation.  This is still a high-risk practice.

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Code Injection (via Unsafe Usage of `faker` Output)](./attack_surfaces/indirect_code_injection__via_unsafe_usage_of__faker__output_.md)

*   **Description:**  Using `faker`-generated data in an unsafe way that allows for code injection (SQL injection, XSS, etc.). This is *not* a vulnerability in `faker` itself, but a misuse of its output.  However, `faker`'s role in providing the potentially malicious input is direct.
*   **How `faker` Contributes:** `faker` generates strings, and if these strings are not properly sanitized, they could contain malicious code if used in vulnerable contexts.
*   **Example:**  Using `faker.text()` to generate a "username" and then directly inserting that username into an SQL query without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution on the server or in the user's browser, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other severe consequences.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if exploitable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always sanitize and validate *all* data, including `faker`-generated data, before using it in any context where it could be interpreted as code.**
    *   Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions.
    *   Use appropriate output encoding and escaping (e.g., HTML escaping) when rendering data in web pages or other user interfaces.
    *   Avoid using `eval()` or similar functions with untrusted data.

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional PII Generation and Storage](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_pii_generation_and_storage.md)

* **Description:** `faker` accidentally generates data that resembles real PII, and this data is stored or processed as if it were real.
* **How `faker` Contributes:** While designed for fake data, `faker` can, by chance, create combinations that match real-world PII.
* **Example:** `faker` generates a name, address, and phone number combination that coincidentally matches a real person. This data is then stored in a production database.
* **Impact:** Potential privacy violations, legal issues, and reputational damage if the synthetic PII is mistaken for real PII and mishandled.
* **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on data handling practices and jurisdiction)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid storing `faker`-generated data persistently in production databases.**
    * If persistent storage is absolutely necessary (e.g., for long-term testing), clearly mark the data as synthetic (e.g., with a dedicated flag or separate table).
    * Implement data handling procedures that prevent synthetic data from being treated as real PII (e.g., data masking, access controls).
    * Consider using `faker` providers that are less likely to generate realistic PII (e.g., avoid providers for real addresses or phone numbers if not strictly necessary).
