# Threat Model Analysis for fzaninotto/faker

## Threat: [Production Data Contamination](./threats/production_data_contamination.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, through social engineering or exploiting a misconfiguration, convinces a developer to run a script containing `faker` calls against the production database.  Alternatively, a developer accidentally executes a test script intended for the development environment against the production database.  This could overwrite real user data with fake data.
*   **Impact:**  Data loss, data corruption, service disruption, reputational damage, potential legal and financial consequences.  Real user accounts could be deleted or modified, leading to loss of access and functionality.
*   **Affected Faker Component:**  All data generation functions (e.g., `name()`, `address()`, `email()`, `text()`, etc.) across all providers.  The core issue is *misuse* of the library, not a specific component vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Environment Separation:**  Implement robust separation between development, testing, and production environments.  Use different database credentials, servers, and network access controls.
    *   **Database Access Controls:**  Restrict database access for development and testing accounts.  Production database credentials should *never* be accessible from development environments.  Use the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews for any script that interacts with databases, with a specific focus on identifying and preventing the use of `faker` in production contexts.
    *   **Automated Build Processes:**  Use automated build and deployment pipelines that exclude `faker` from production builds.  This prevents accidental inclusion of the library.
    *   **Developer Training:**  Educate developers on the risks of using `faker` and the importance of environment separation.
    *   **"Dry Run" Mode:**  If possible, implement a "dry run" mode for database scripts, where changes are simulated but not actually applied.
    *   **Database Backups:**  Maintain regular, tested backups of the production database to allow for recovery in case of accidental data modification.

## Threat: [Predictable Data Exploitation (High Severity Case)](./threats/predictable_data_exploitation__high_severity_case_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker observes that `faker` is used with a default or easily guessable seed *and* that the generated data is used for security-sensitive purposes (e.g., generating temporary passwords, session tokens, or cryptographic keys â€“ *misuse* of `faker`). They use this knowledge to predict the generated values and bypass security controls.
*   **Impact:**  Bypass of security controls (e.g., predicting session IDs or one-time passwords), leading to unauthorized access or account takeover.
*   **Affected Faker Component:**  The seeding mechanism (`Faker\Factory::create()` and the `seed()` method).  Any provider that relies on the random number generator is affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Use Faker for Security-Sensitive Data:**  `faker` is *not* designed for generating cryptographically secure values.  Use dedicated cryptographic libraries for generating passwords, tokens, keys, etc.
    *   **Cryptographically Secure Seeding (Even for Non-Critical Uses):**  Even if the data isn't directly security-sensitive, use a cryptographically secure random number generator to seed `faker` to avoid any potential predictability issues.
    *   **Application-Level Uniqueness:** Enforce uniqueness at the application level.
