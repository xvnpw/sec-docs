* **Data Injection Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:**  The application is vulnerable to data injection attacks where malicious data can manipulate queries or commands.
    * **How Faker Contributes:** Faker generates strings that, if used directly in SQL queries, HTML output, or system commands without proper sanitization or encoding, can introduce injection vulnerabilities. Faker's ability to generate diverse and sometimes complex strings increases the likelihood of generating strings that could be interpreted as malicious code.
    * **Example:**  A generated `name` like `' OR '1'='1'` used directly in a SQL query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{{ generated_name }}'` could bypass authentication.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; execution of arbitrary code on the server or client-side.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for database interactions.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
        * Employ context-aware output encoding.
        * Avoid using Faker-generated data directly in security-sensitive contexts without thorough sanitization.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks where malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users.
    * **How Faker Contributes:** Faker can generate strings containing HTML tags or JavaScript code snippets within fields like names, addresses, or descriptions. If this generated data is displayed on a web page without proper encoding, the malicious script can execute in the user's browser.
    * **Example:** A generated `company` name like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` displayed directly on a webpage will execute the JavaScript alert.
    * **Impact:**  Stealing user credentials, session hijacking, defacing websites, redirecting users to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict output encoding.
        * Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP).
        * Regularly review and sanitize any Faker-generated data that might be used in user-facing interfaces, even in non-production environments.

* **Misuse in Production Code**
    * **Description:**  Faker is intended for development and testing. Using it in production code can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful behavior.
    * **How Faker Contributes:**  Accidentally or intentionally using Faker to generate data in a production environment could overwrite or corrupt real user data.
    * **Example:** A developer mistakenly uses a Faker function to generate a default username for new users in a production system, overwriting legitimate user data.
    * **Impact:**  Data corruption, loss of data integrity, unexpected application behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Clearly delineate between development/testing and production code.
        * Implement code review processes to catch instances of Faker being used in production code.
        * Use feature flags or environment variables to disable or remove Faker-related code in production builds.
        * Educate developers on the intended use of Faker and the risks of using it in production.
