# Attack Surface Analysis for fzaninotto/faker

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Data Injection Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:**  Malicious code can be injected into an application through data generated by Faker if this data is not properly sanitized or handled when used in contexts like database queries or shell commands.
    * **How Faker Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Faker generates strings that, if used directly in SQL queries, shell commands, or other sensitive contexts without proper escaping or parameterization, can introduce injection vulnerabilities. For example, a generated name containing a single quote can break an SQL query.
    * **Example:** An application uses `Faker\Factory::create()->name()` to generate a username and directly inserts it into an SQL query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{$faker->name()}'`. If the generated name is `O'Malley'`, this breaks the query and could allow for SQL injection.
    * **Impact:**  Potential for unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion (SQL injection), or arbitrary command execution on the server (command injection).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
        * Properly escape or sanitize any Faker-generated data before using it in shell commands or other sensitive system calls.
        * Implement input validation to restrict the characters and formats allowed in fields populated by Faker data, even in development/testing environments.

## Attack Surface: [Risk in Production Environments (Accidental Use)](./attack_surfaces/risk_in_production_environments__accidental_use_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Risk in Production Environments (Accidental Use)
    * **Description:** If Faker code or configurations are mistakenly left enabled in a production environment, it could lead to unpredictable and potentially harmful data being generated and used in live systems.
    * **How Faker Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Faker is intended for development and testing. Its presence and active usage in production are a significant security risk.
    * **Example:** A developer accidentally leaves a feature flag enabled in production that uses Faker to generate default user data. This could lead to the creation of numerous fake user accounts in the live system.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistencies, potential exposure of fake data to real users, system instability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strictly separate development and production code and configurations.
        * Implement build processes that ensure Faker is not included or enabled in production deployments.
        * Use feature flags or environment variables to control the usage of Faker and ensure it's disabled in production.
        * Regularly audit production code to ensure no Faker-related code is present.
