# Attack Surface Analysis for briannesbitt/carbon

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation and Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_and_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application accepts user-provided date/time strings and uses Carbon to parse them. Maliciously crafted or unexpected input can cause errors or incorrect interpretations.
*   **How Carbon Contributes:** Carbon's parsing functions (`Carbon::parse()`, `Carbon::createFromFormat()`, etc.) are directly used to interpret these strings. If not handled carefully, they can be susceptible to unexpected input.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a very long or malformed date string like "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY-MM-DD" or a string with unexpected characters.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application crashes due to unhandled exceptions.
    *   Incorrect date/time values leading to logical errors in the application (e.g., incorrect scheduling, authorization bypasses).
    *   Denial of service due to excessive resource consumption during parsing of complex strings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on the client-side and server-side *before* passing data to Carbon. Use regular expressions or predefined formats to ensure the input conforms to expectations.
    *   **Use Strict Parsing Methods:** Utilize Carbon's strict parsing methods (e.g., `Carbon::createStrict()`, `Carbon::createFromFormat('Y-m-d H:i:s', $input)`) which throw exceptions for invalid formats instead of attempting to guess.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement proper try-catch blocks around Carbon parsing operations to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent application crashes. Log errors for debugging.
    *   **Sanitize Input:**  Remove or escape potentially harmful characters from user input before parsing.
