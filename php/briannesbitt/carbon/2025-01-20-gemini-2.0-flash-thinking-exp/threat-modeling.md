# Threat Model Analysis for briannesbitt/carbon

## Threat: [Malicious Input to `Carbon::parse()`](./threats/malicious_input_to__carbonparse___.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Input to `Carbon::parse()`
    * **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted string to the `Carbon::parse()` function. This could involve injecting unexpected characters, invalid date formats, or excessively long strings. The function might then throw an unhandled exception, leading to application errors, or potentially consume excessive resources trying to parse the malformed input, causing a denial of service.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential for information disclosure through error messages.
    * **Affected Component:** `Carbon::parse()` function.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation on any user-provided data before passing it to `Carbon::parse()`.
        * Use try-catch blocks to handle potential `InvalidArgumentException` exceptions thrown by `Carbon::parse()`.
        * Consider using `Carbon::canBeCreatedFromFormat()` to check if the input string matches an expected format before parsing.

## Threat: [Timezone Manipulation leading to Access Control Bypass](./threats/timezone_manipulation_leading_to_access_control_bypass.md)

* **Threat:** Timezone Manipulation leading to Access Control Bypass
    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates timezone settings (either directly if the application allows it, or indirectly through system settings if the application relies on them) to bypass time-based access control mechanisms. For example, they might set their timezone to a future time to gain access to resources that should not be available yet.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, circumvention of security policies.
    * **Affected Component:** `Carbon::setTimezone()`, `Carbon::now()` (when timezone is not explicitly set).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store and compare timestamps in a consistent, server-controlled timezone (e.g., UTC).
        * Avoid relying solely on client-provided timezone information for critical security decisions.
        * If user-specific timezones are necessary, validate and sanitize the input carefully.

## Threat: [Locale Data Vulnerabilities leading to XSS](./threats/locale_data_vulnerabilities_leading_to_xss.md)

* **Threat:** Locale Data Vulnerabilities leading to XSS
    * **Description:** If the locale data used by Carbon is sourced from an untrusted location or is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious code into the locale data. When Carbon uses this data for formatting, it could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the output is not properly escaped.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, potential for session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
    * **Affected Component:** `Carbon::locale()`, `Carbon::translatedFormat()`, potentially internal locale data handling.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only use trusted and reputable sources for locale data.
        * Implement strict input validation and output encoding/escaping when dealing with localized date and time formats.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Malicious Carbon Objects](./threats/deserialization_of_malicious_carbon_objects.md)

* **Threat:** Deserialization of Malicious Carbon Objects
    * **Description:** If the application deserializes data that could contain serialized Carbon objects (e.g., from user input or external sources), an attacker could craft a malicious serialized Carbon object that, upon deserialization, triggers unintended code execution or other vulnerabilities (object injection).
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, application compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** `serialize()`, `unserialize()` (if used directly with Carbon objects).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into Carbon objects.
        * If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and implement integrity checks to detect tampering.
        * Consider serializing only the necessary date/time components as primitive data types instead of the entire Carbon object.
