# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the 'carbon' PHP library, aims to provide a simple, extensible and fluent API for working with dates and times in PHP.

- Business Priorities:
  - Improve developer productivity by providing a more intuitive and feature-rich date and time manipulation library compared to PHP's built-in functions.
  - Enhance code readability and maintainability in PHP projects that require date and time operations.
  - Ensure the library is reliable, accurate, and performs well across different PHP environments.
  - Foster a community around the library to encourage contributions, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.

- Business Goals:
  - Become the de-facto standard date and time library for PHP development.
  - Increase adoption of the library within the PHP ecosystem.
  - Maintain a high level of code quality and stability.
  - Provide comprehensive documentation and examples to facilitate ease of use.

- Business Risks:
  - Bugs or inaccuracies in date and time calculations could lead to critical errors in applications using the library, impacting data integrity and business logic.
  - Performance issues could negatively affect the performance of applications relying on the library.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by attackers if not addressed promptly.
  - Lack of community support or maintainability could lead to stagnation and eventual obsolescence of the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository with issue tracking and pull request workflow (Implemented: GitHub).
  - security control: Open source project with community review and contributions (Implemented: GitHub).
  - security control: Unit tests to ensure code correctness (Implemented: Project codebase).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced during development.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Integrate Dependency Check tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from external developers.
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning of published releases (e.g., using platforms like Packagist).

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable as this is a library and does not handle user authentication directly. Applications using this library will handle authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable as this is a library and does not handle user authorization directly. Applications using this library will handle authorization.
  - Input Validation:
    - The library must perform robust input validation on all date and time strings, formats, and parameters to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities due to malformed input.
    - Input validation should include checks for valid date ranges, time formats, and timezone identifiers.
    - Error handling for invalid input should be secure and prevent information leakage.
  - Cryptography:
    - Cryptography is not a primary requirement for a date and time library. However, if the library ever needs to handle sensitive time-related data (e.g., timestamps for security events), it should use secure and well-vetted cryptographic libraries and practices. Currently, cryptography is not explicitly used.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Accurate date and time calculations in applications using the Carbon library. Incorrect calculations can lead to errors in scheduling, data processing, financial transactions, logging, and other critical application functionalities.
  - Availability and integrity of the Carbon library package on Packagist. If the package is unavailable or compromised, it can disrupt PHP development workflows and potentially introduce malicious code into applications.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the Carbon library: Confidentiality and integrity are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of potential vulnerabilities.
  - Packagist package: Integrity and availability are crucial to ensure developers can securely and reliably install the library.
  - Date and time data processed by applications using Carbon: Sensitivity depends on the application context. In some cases, date and time data can be personally identifiable information (PII) or related to sensitive business operations. The library itself should handle date and time data securely and prevent unintended information leakage.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended deployment environment for applications using the Carbon library? (Assumption: Broad range of PHP environments, including web servers, CLI applications, etc.)
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements for applications using the Carbon library? (Assumption: General best practices for software libraries apply, no specific compliance mentioned.)
  - Is there a dedicated security team or individual responsible for the security of the Carbon library project? (Assumption: Security is primarily handled by the maintainers and community contributors.)
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports for the Carbon library? (Assumption: Standard GitHub issue reporting and pull request process, potentially needs a more formalized security policy.)

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a high-quality, widely adopted date and time library for PHP developers. Reliability and ease of use are key priorities.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important but might not be the absolute top priority compared to functionality and usability for an open-source library. Security controls are primarily focused on secure development practices and vulnerability management within the open-source context.
  - DESIGN: The library is designed to be a standalone component integrated into PHP applications. It does not have its own deployment infrastructure. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions.
