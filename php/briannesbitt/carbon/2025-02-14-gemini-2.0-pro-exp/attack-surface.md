# Attack Surface Analysis for briannesbitt/carbon

## Attack Surface: [Critical: Unvalidated Input](./attack_surfaces/critical_unvalidated_input.md)

*   **Description:** Carbon's parsing functions (like `parse()`, `createFromFormat()`) can be vulnerable to injection attacks if user-supplied input is not properly validated.  If an attacker can control the format string or the input string, they could potentially inject malicious code.
*   **How Carbon Contributes:** Carbon's flexibility in parsing various date and time formats, while powerful, can be dangerous if not used with extreme caution.  The `createFromFormat()` function, if used with a user-supplied format string, is particularly risky.
*   **Example:**  An attacker could inject format specifiers that cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to denial of service or even arbitrary code execution if the parsed date is used in a vulnerable context (e.g., in an `eval()` call or similar).
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strictly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before passing it to Carbon functions.**  Use whitelisting (allow only known-good formats) rather than blacklisting (trying to filter out bad formats).
    *   **Avoid using user-supplied format strings with `createFromFormat()`.**  If you must, use a very strict whitelist of allowed formats.  Prefer `parse()` with a fixed, trusted format string whenever possible.
    *   **Use a well-defined and restricted set of allowed date/time formats.**  Avoid overly permissive formats that could be abused.
    *   **Consider using a dedicated date/time validation library *before* passing data to Carbon.** This adds an extra layer of defense.

## Attack Surface: [High: Timezone Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/high_timezone_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect handling of timezones can lead to logic errors, data corruption, and potential security vulnerabilities.  If the application relies on accurate timezone calculations for security-critical operations (e.g., access control, session management), incorrect timezone handling can be exploited.
*   **How Carbon Contributes:** While Carbon provides timezone support, it relies on the underlying system's timezone database and PHP's timezone handling.  Misconfiguration or outdated timezone data can lead to incorrect results.
*   **Example:** An attacker might try to manipulate the timezone to bypass time-based restrictions, such as bypassing rate limiting or accessing resources outside of allowed time windows.  They might also try to cause data inconsistencies by exploiting differences in timezone handling.
*   **Impact:**  Bypass of security controls, data corruption, denial of service (in some cases).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Always explicitly set the default timezone.** Use `date_default_timezone_set()` or a similar mechanism to ensure a consistent timezone across the application.
    *   **Use UTC for internal storage and calculations whenever possible.** Convert to local timezones only for display purposes.
    *   **Validate and sanitize user-supplied timezone information.**  Use a whitelist of allowed timezones.
    *   **Regularly update the system's timezone database (tzdata).**
    *   **Be aware of daylight saving time (DST) transitions and handle them correctly.**

## Attack Surface: [High: Locale-Dependent Parsing Issues](./attack_surfaces/high_locale-dependent_parsing_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Different locales have different date/time formats.  If the application doesn't handle locales correctly, it can lead to parsing errors or unexpected behavior.
*   **How Carbon Contributes:** Carbon's parsing functions can be influenced by the system's locale settings. If the application doesn't explicitly set the locale, it might use a default locale that doesn't match the expected input format.
*   **Example:** An attacker might provide a date string that is valid in one locale but invalid in the server's default locale, leading to parsing errors or incorrect date interpretation.
*   **Impact:**  Data corruption, denial of service, potential bypass of validation checks.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Explicitly set the locale for date/time parsing.** Use `setlocale()` or Carbon's locale-aware methods (e.g., `parse('...', 'fr_FR')`) to ensure consistent parsing behavior.
    *   **Validate user-supplied locale information.** If users can specify a locale, ensure it's a valid and supported locale.
    *   **Consider using a standardized date/time format (e.g., ISO 8601) for internal storage and exchange.**

## Attack Surface: [High: Integer Overflow/Underflow (Less Likely, but Possible)](./attack_surfaces/high_integer_overflowunderflow__less_likely__but_possible_.md)

*   **Description:** While less common with modern PHP versions, extremely large or small timestamp values could potentially lead to integer overflow or underflow issues in some calculations.
*   **How Carbon Contributes:** Carbon deals with timestamps, which are often represented as integers.
*   **Example:** An attacker might try to provide a timestamp that, when manipulated, causes an integer overflow or underflow, leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:**  Unpredictable behavior, potential denial of service.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Use 64-bit systems.** 64-bit systems have a much larger range for integers, making overflow/underflow less likely.
    *   **Validate input ranges.** Ensure that date/time values are within reasonable bounds.
    *   **Use appropriate data types.** Ensure that variables used to store timestamps are large enough to handle the expected range of values.

## Attack Surface: [High: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Low Probability, but worth mentioning)](./attack_surfaces/high_regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos___low_probability__but_worth_mentioning_.md)

* **Description:** Although Carbon itself doesn't heavily rely on regular expressions for parsing, it's possible that some internal functions or underlying PHP date/time functions might use regular expressions that are vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.
* **How Carbon Contributes:** Indirectly, through its reliance on underlying PHP functions.
* **Example:** An attacker could craft a specially designed date string that triggers a catastrophic backtracking scenario in a regular expression used for parsing.
* **Impact:** Denial of service.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Keep PHP updated:** PHP updates often include security fixes, including those related to regular expression handling.
    * **Avoid custom regular expressions for date/time parsing if possible.** Rely on Carbon's built-in parsing functions, which are generally more robust.
    * **If you *must* use custom regular expressions, carefully analyze them for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.** Use tools like regex101.com to test and analyze your regular expressions.
