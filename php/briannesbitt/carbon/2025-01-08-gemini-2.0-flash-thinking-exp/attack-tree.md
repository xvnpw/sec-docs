```
Compromise Application via Carbon Exploitation
*   OR: Exploit Output Formatting Vulnerabilities
    *   AND: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output **[HIGH_RISK_PATH]** **[CRITICAL_NODE]**
        *   Goal: Inject Malicious Scripts
            *   Action: If Carbon's formatted output is directly rendered in a web page without sanitization, inject XSS payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Formatting Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_formatting_vulnerabilities_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_output.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application takes date or time information formatted by the Carbon library and directly embeds it into web pages without proper HTML encoding or sanitization, an attacker can craft a malicious format string or manipulate the data that Carbon formats. This crafted output can then contain malicious JavaScript code. When a user views the page, this injected script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:** High. Successful XSS attacks can lead to account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, and defacement of the website.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Timezone Handling Issues -> Timezone Manipulation for Logic Bypasses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_timezone_handling_issues_-_timezone_manipulation_for_logic_bypasses.md)

**Attack Vector:** Applications often use timestamps and date/time comparisons for access control, scheduling, or other time-sensitive logic. If the application doesn't consistently handle timezones or if an attacker can influence the timezone associated with a Carbon object, they might be able to manipulate these comparisons. For example, they might set a Carbon object's timezone to bypass a "not before" or "expires at" check, gaining access to resources they shouldn't have.
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to features, data, or administrative functions, potentially disrupting services or compromising security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Issues -> Object Injection via Unsafe Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serializationdeserialization_issues_-_object_injection_via_unsafe_deserialization.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application serializes Carbon objects and then unserializes them later (e.g., when storing them in sessions or databases), and if the application uses the `unserialize()` function on untrusted data, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized string. This string, when unserialized, can instantiate arbitrary PHP objects and execute code within the application's context. This is a PHP-specific vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** High. Successful object injection can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to completely compromise the server, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially gain full control of the application and its underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Errors Due to Misuse of Carbon -> Incorrect Time Comparisons](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_errors_due_to_misuse_of_carbon_-_incorrect_time_comparisons.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers might make mistakes when comparing Carbon objects, especially when dealing with different timezones, date parts, or using incorrect comparison methods. An attacker who understands this flawed logic can manipulate timestamps or dates to make comparisons evaluate incorrectly. For instance, they might craft a timestamp that bypasses an authentication check based on an "expiry date" comparison.
    *   **Impact:** High. Incorrect time comparisons can lead to critical security vulnerabilities, such as bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Errors Due to Misuse of Carbon -> Incorrect Time Calculations Leading to Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_errors_due_to_misuse_of_carbon_-_incorrect_time_calculations_leading_to_flaws.md)

**Attack Vector:** Errors in calculating time differences, adding or subtracting time, or handling daylight saving time transitions can lead to exploitable flaws. For example, an incorrect calculation of an expiration date could allow users to access premium features for longer than intended, or an error in calculating a timeout could lead to a denial-of-service condition or bypass security measures.
    *   **Impact:** Medium-High. Incorrect time calculations can lead to manipulation of application state, data inconsistencies, privilege escalation, or other security-relevant flaws, depending on how the calculations are used within the application's logic.
