# Attack Surface Analysis for briannesbitt/carbon

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting the process of converting serialized data back into objects. If attacker-controlled serialized data is unserialized, it can lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious actions.
    * **How Carbon Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If Carbon objects are serialized (e.g., for caching or session storage) and then unserialized from potentially untrusted sources, attackers can craft malicious serialized Carbon objects. Upon unserialization, PHP's magic methods within these crafted objects (or other related classes) can be triggered, leading to code execution.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a serialized Carbon object stored in a cookie. When the application unserializes this modified object, it triggers a `__wakeup()` or `__destruct()` method in a related vulnerable class, executing malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid unserializing untrusted data:** The primary mitigation is to avoid unserializing data from untrusted sources.
        * **Use safer serialization formats:** Prefer formats like JSON which don't inherently allow for object instantiation upon deserialization.
        * **Input validation and sanitization:** If unserialization is unavoidable, rigorously validate the structure and content of the serialized data before unserializing.
        * **Code auditing:** Regularly audit code that handles serialization and unserialization for potential vulnerabilities.
