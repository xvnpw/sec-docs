# Threat Model Analysis for briannesbitt/carbon

## Threat: [Malicious Date/Time String Parsing](./threats/malicious_datetime_string_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted string to Carbon's parsing functions (like `Carbon::parse()` or `Carbon::createFromFormat()`) with the intent of causing unexpected behavior. This might involve supplying extremely long strings, unusual characters, or format specifiers that exploit internal parsing logic. The attacker's goal is to trigger errors, consume excessive resources leading to a denial of service, or potentially even exploit underlying PHP vulnerabilities if Carbon's parsing interacts unexpectedly with PHP's internal date/time handling.

**Impact:** Application errors, potential denial of service due to resource exhaustion, or in very rare cases, potential for deeper system vulnerabilities if the parsing triggers unexpected behavior in underlying PHP functions.

**Affected Carbon Component:** Parsing functions (`Carbon::parse()`, `Carbon::createFromFormat()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and validate user-provided date/time input before passing it to Carbon.
* Prefer using `Carbon::createFromFormat()` with a specific, known format string when dealing with user input, rather than relying on `Carbon::parse()` which attempts to guess the format.
* Implement robust error handling around all Carbon parsing operations to gracefully handle invalid input.
* Consider using a dedicated input validation library to pre-validate date/time strings before they reach Carbon.

## Threat: [Time Zone Manipulation Leading to Authorization Bypass](./threats/time_zone_manipulation_leading_to_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates time zone information (either by providing incorrect time zone data or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles time zones) to bypass time-based authorization checks. For example, if access to a resource is granted only within a specific time window in a particular time zone, an attacker could manipulate the perceived time zone to appear within that window even when they are not.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources or functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.

**Affected Carbon Component:** Time zone handling methods (`setTimezone()`, `timezone()`, `utc()`, `local()`, `setTimezoneRegion()`, `setTimezoneName()`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* For critical authorization checks, rely on a consistent and reliable time source, preferably server-side and in UTC.
* Avoid making authorization decisions solely based on client-provided time zone information.
* Explicitly define and enforce the expected time zone for all relevant operations within the application.
* Store timestamps in a consistent, unambiguous format like UTC in the database.
* When displaying times to users, convert from the stored UTC time to the user's local time zone, but do not rely on this conversion for security decisions.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Malicious Carbon Objects](./threats/deserialization_of_malicious_carbon_objects.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to inject a maliciously crafted serialized Carbon object into the application's data stream (e.g., through session data, cookies, or database entries) and the application attempts to deserialize it using functions like `unserialize()`. This could lead to object injection vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a general PHP vulnerability, but Carbon objects are susceptible if handled improperly.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.

**Affected Carbon Component:**  The Carbon object itself is the affected component, specifically when involved in serialization and deserialization processes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never unserialize data from untrusted sources.** This is a fundamental security principle in PHP.
* If serialization of Carbon objects is necessary, use safer serialization formats like JSON and the `toJson()` and `parse()` methods provided by Carbon, rather than relying on `serialize()` and `unserialize()`.
* Implement strong input validation and sanitization on any data that could potentially contain serialized objects.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Date/Time Calculations Leading to Security Flaws](./threats/logic_errors_in_datetime_calculations_leading_to_security_flaws.md)

**Description:** Developers make mistakes when using Carbon's date/time manipulation methods (e.g., `add()`, `sub()`, `diff()`, `isPast()`, `isFuture()`) leading to incorrect application logic that has security implications. For example, an error in calculating password reset token expiry times could allow tokens to remain valid indefinitely.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, bypass of security restrictions, data inconsistencies, or other security vulnerabilities depending on the specific logic error.

**Affected Carbon Component:** Date/time manipulation and comparison methods (`add()`, `sub()`, `diff()`, `isPast()`, `isFuture()`, `greaterThan()`, `lessThan()`, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test all code involving Carbon's date/time calculations, paying close attention to edge cases and potential off-by-one errors.
* Write clear and well-documented code to make the date/time logic easy to understand and verify.
* Implement unit tests specifically to verify the correctness of date/time operations and ensure they behave as expected under various conditions.
* Consider using code review processes to have another developer examine the date/time logic for potential flaws.
