# Attack Surface Analysis for phpdocumentor/reflectioncommon

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Code Reflection](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_code_reflection.md)

*   **Description:** The application reflects on PHP code provided by an untrusted source (e.g., user input, external data).
    *   **How `reflectioncommon` Contributes:** `reflectioncommon` provides the tools to introspect this untrusted code, potentially revealing sensitive information or enabling the application to make decisions based on malicious code structures. While the core reflection is done by PHP's internal engine, `reflectioncommon` facilitates this process and the interpretation of the reflected data.
    *   **Example:** A plugin system allows users to upload PHP code. The application uses `reflectioncommon` to analyze the plugin's classes and methods to determine its functionality. A malicious user uploads a plugin containing code designed to exploit vulnerabilities or access sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (revealing internal application structure, sensitive data within the code), potential for code injection if the reflected data is used to dynamically construct and execute code later.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid reflecting on untrusted code entirely.** If possible, use predefined, trusted code paths.
        *   **Implement strict input validation and sanitization.**  Remove or escape potentially harmful code constructs before reflection.
        *   **Use a sandboxed environment for executing untrusted code.** This isolates the untrusted code from the main application.
        *   **Employ static analysis tools** to scan uploaded code for potential threats before reflection.

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Code Execution via Reflected Information](./attack_surfaces/indirect_code_execution_via_reflected_information.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses the information obtained from `reflectioncommon` to make decisions about which code to execute or how to construct executable code. If an attacker can influence the code being reflected upon, they can indirectly control the application's behavior.
    *   **How `reflectioncommon` Contributes:** `reflectioncommon` provides the means to inspect code structure. If this information is used to dynamically load classes, call methods, or construct code strings for execution (e.g., with `call_user_func`, `eval`), manipulating the reflected code becomes a vector for indirect code execution.
    *   **Example:** The application uses reflection to determine which class to instantiate based on a user-provided string. A malicious user provides a string corresponding to a class that performs harmful actions.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid making security-critical decisions based solely on reflected information from untrusted sources.**
        *   **Use whitelists or predefined mappings instead of dynamically determining code execution paths based on reflection of untrusted input.**
        *   **If dynamic code execution based on reflected data is unavoidable, implement strict validation and sanitization of the reflected information.**
        *   **Employ the principle of least privilege when instantiating classes or calling methods dynamically.**
