# Threat Model Analysis for phpdocumentor/reflectioncommon

## Threat: [Dynamic Class/Method Instantiation/Invocation via Reflection](./threats/dynamic_classmethod_instantiationinvocation_via_reflection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can leverage reflection capabilities provided by `reflectioncommon` to dynamically instantiate arbitrary classes or invoke arbitrary methods. This is achieved by manipulating input that influences the class or method names being used with reflection functions offered by the library.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Functions within `reflectioncommon` that facilitate class instantiation (e.g., indirectly through `ReflectionClass`) or method invocation (e.g., indirectly through `ReflectionMethod`) when the target class or method name is derived from external input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input that is used to determine class or method names for reflection operations.
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed class and method names.
        *   Avoid using user-supplied input directly to construct class or method names for reflection.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege, limiting the classes and methods that can be instantiated or invoked via reflection.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Direct Access to Class Internals via Reflection](./threats/information_disclosure_through_direct_access_to_class_internals_via_reflection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can utilize `reflectioncommon` to directly access and inspect the internal structure of classes, including private properties, methods, and constants. This allows them to bypass intended access restrictions and gain insights into the application's implementation details.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive internal details about the application's architecture, logic, and potentially sensitive data stored in private properties. This information can be used to plan further attacks or identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Functions within `reflectioncommon` that provide access to class members, such as methods for retrieving properties (`ReflectionClass::getProperties()`), methods (`ReflectionClass::getMethods()`), and constants (`ReflectionClass::getConstants()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the exposure of reflection data in production environments. Avoid exposing raw reflection output to users.
        *   Implement access controls to restrict who or what parts of the application can perform reflection operations.
        *   Be mindful of information leakage through debugging interfaces or error messages that might expose reflection details.
        *   While not directly preventing reflection, secure coding practices should minimize the storage of highly sensitive data in a way that direct property access would be catastrophic.
