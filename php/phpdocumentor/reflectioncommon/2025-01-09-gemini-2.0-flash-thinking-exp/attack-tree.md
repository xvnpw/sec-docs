## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using ReflectionCommon](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_reflectioncommon.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and the root of all high-risk paths. Success at this point means the application's security has been breached.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Reflection Target](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_reflection_target.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to control the target of the reflection operation performed by `reflectioncommon`. This could involve influencing the class name, method name, or property name being passed to the library's reflection functions.
    * **Significance:** Successfully manipulating the reflection target allows the attacker to direct the application's introspection capabilities towards malicious or sensitive components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Malicious Class](./attack_tree_paths/target_malicious_class.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker's goal is to make the application reflect on a class containing malicious code. This could involve classes they've injected or existing classes with exploitable functionality.
    * **Significance:** Reflecting on a malicious class is a direct pathway to achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Class Name via User Input](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_class_name_via_user_input.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application uses user-provided input (e.g., from URLs, forms, configuration files) to determine the class name for reflection. The attacker injects the name of their malicious class into this input.
    * **Significance:** This is a common vulnerability pattern where untrusted data directly influences critical application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Input Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_input_handling.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input before using it to determine the reflection target. This allows the attacker's malicious class name to be processed by `reflectioncommon`.
    * **Significance:** This represents the successful exploitation of an input validation vulnerability, a frequent point of entry for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Autoloading Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_autoloading_mechanism.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages PHP's autoloading feature. By introducing a file containing their malicious class into a location where the autoloader will find it, they can ensure the class is loaded when `reflectioncommon` attempts to reflect on it.
    * **Significance:** This bypasses the need for direct injection of the class name in some scenarios, offering an alternative attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Class File](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_class_file.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker successfully uploads or includes a PHP file containing their malicious class onto the server. This could be through file upload vulnerabilities, local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities, or other means.
    * **Significance:** This sets the stage for the malicious class to be loaded and executed when reflection is performed on it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Reflection Logic Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reflection_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Instead of targeting specific classes, the attacker focuses on weaknesses within the `reflectioncommon` library itself. This could involve exploiting how the library handles different data types, edge cases, or unexpected input.
    * **Significance:** Successfully exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or even code execution within the context of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Input Validation/Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_input_validationsanitization.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application attempts to validate or sanitize input before using it with `reflectioncommon`, but the attacker finds ways to circumvent these checks. This could involve using encoding tricks, unexpected characters, or exploiting flaws in the validation logic.
    * **Significance:** This highlights the importance of robust and comprehensive input validation. Bypassing these checks allows the attacker to supply malicious input that would otherwise be blocked.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input to Circumvent Checks](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_to_circumvent_checks.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker meticulously crafts input designed to pass the application's validation checks while still being processed in a harmful way by `reflectioncommon`.
    * **Significance:** This represents the successful execution of a bypass technique, demonstrating a weakness in the application's security measures.
