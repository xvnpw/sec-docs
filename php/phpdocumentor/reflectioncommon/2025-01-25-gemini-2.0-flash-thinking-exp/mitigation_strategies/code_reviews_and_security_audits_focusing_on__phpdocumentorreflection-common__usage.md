#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated Analysis

*   **"All `phpdocumentor/reflection-common`-Related Threats (Low to High Severity)":**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a broad claim. While code reviews and security audits are valuable general security practices, they are not a silver bullet for *all* threats.  The effectiveness depends heavily on the quality and focus of these activities.
    *   **Potential `phpdocumentor/reflection-common`-Related Threats (Examples):**
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Improper use of reflection could inadvertently expose sensitive information about the application's internal structure, classes, methods, or properties.
        *   **Logic Bypasses:**  Reflection could be used to bypass intended access controls or business logic if not implemented securely.
        *   **Unexpected Behavior/Errors:**  Incorrect or unintended reflection operations could lead to application errors, crashes, or unpredictable behavior.

*   **"All `phpdocumentor/reflection-common`-Related Threats: Medium (Provides a proactive layer of defense by identifying and addressing potential issues related to `phpdocumentor/reflection-common` usage through human review)."**
    *   **Analysis:**  The "Medium" impact rating is reasonable. Code reviews and security audits are considered important security controls, but they are not preventative controls like input validation or output encoding. They are detective and corrective controls, identifying and fixing issues *before* they are exploited in production.
    *   **Justification for "Medium":**
        *   **Proactive Defense:**  The strategy is proactive as it aims to identify and fix vulnerabilities during development, before deployment.
        *   **Human Review:**  Human review is valuable for understanding context and complex logic, which automated tools might miss.
        *   **Not a Complete Solution:** Code reviews and audits are not foolproof. Human error is still possible, and complex vulnerabilities might be overlooked.  They are also not real-time protection mechanisms.
    *   **Potential for Higher Impact (if implemented well):** If code reviews and audits are conducted rigorously, with well-defined checklists, trained reviewers/auditors, and a strong security culture, the impact could be considered "High" in terms of reducing the *likelihood* of vulnerabilities reaching production. However, the inherent limitations of human review keep it from being a "Very High" impact control like architectural security design.
    *   **Potential for Lower Impact (if implemented poorly):** If checklists are superficial, training is inadequate, audits are infrequent or shallow, the impact could be closer to "Low".

#### 4.4. Currently Implemented and Missing Implementation Analysis
