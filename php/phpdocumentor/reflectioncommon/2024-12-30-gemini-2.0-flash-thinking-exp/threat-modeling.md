### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving phpdocumentor/reflectioncommon

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `phpdocumentor/reflectioncommon` library:

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Private/Protected Class Members
    *   **Description:** An attacker could directly utilize the reflection capabilities provided by `reflectioncommon` to bypass access modifiers (private, protected) and access or inspect properties and methods that are intended to be internal to a class. This is achieved by using `reflectioncommon`'s methods to retrieve information about class members, regardless of their visibility.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in private or protected properties, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized information access. Understanding of internal application logic and algorithms through inspection of private methods, which can aid in discovering further vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `phpDocumentor\Reflection\Php\ClassReflection`, `phpDocumentor\Reflection\Php\Property`, `phpDocumentor\Reflection\Php\Method`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Reliance on Reflection for Security:** Avoid relying solely on access modifiers for security if `reflectioncommon` is used within the application. Implement additional layers of security checks and validation where sensitive data or logic is involved.
        *   **Restrict Reflection Usage:** Limit the use of `reflectioncommon` to only necessary parts of the application. Avoid using it indiscriminately, especially on classes containing sensitive information or critical logic.
        *   **Careful Handling of Reflection Results:** Ensure that the data obtained through `reflectioncommon` is not directly exposed or used in security-sensitive contexts without thorough validation and sanitization. Treat data obtained via reflection as potentially untrusted.
        *   **Consider Alternative Design Patterns:** Explore alternative design patterns that reduce the need for accessing private members, such as using public interfaces or dedicated getter methods for controlled access.
