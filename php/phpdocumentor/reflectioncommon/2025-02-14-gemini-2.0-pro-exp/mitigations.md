# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for phpdocumentor/reflectioncommon

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Whitelisting (Reflection-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_whitelisting__reflection-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Reflection Input:** Pinpoint all locations where data *directly* influences reflection operations using `phpDocumentor/reflection-common`. This includes any input used to construct class names, method names, property names, or type hints that are *passed to* `reflection-common` functions or classes.
2.  **Define Reflection Whitelist:** Create a strict, predefined list of *allowed* class names, method names, property names, and type hints that are permitted for reflection *using `reflection-common`*. This list should be as restrictive as possible.
3.  **Implement Whitelist Check:** *Before* any `reflection-common` call, verify that the input (class name, method name, etc.) is present in the whitelist. Use strict comparison (e.g., `in_array()`).
4.  **Reject Non-Whitelisted Input:** If the input is *not* in the whitelist, immediately reject the operation. Do *not* call any `reflection-common` functions. Throw an exception, log the attempt, and return a generic error.
5.  **Format Validation (Reflection Context):** Even for whitelisted input, perform format validation *specifically tailored to the expected input type*. Use regular expressions or other validation methods to ensure the input conforms to valid PHP syntax for class names, method names, etc., *before* passing it to `reflection-common`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (Indirect via Reflection):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from using `reflection-common` to instantiate arbitrary classes or trigger unexpected behavior by controlling class names, etc., passed to the library.
*   **Information Disclosure (Reflection-Specific):** (Severity: High) - Limits the scope of reflection performed by `reflection-common` to only authorized components, preventing leakage of internal details.
*   **Denial of Service (Reflection-Induced):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces DoS risk by preventing `reflection-common` from being used to reflect on non-existent or excessively complex types, which could consume resources.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (nearly eliminated with a correct whitelist).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced, depending on whitelist comprehensiveness.
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "No whitelisting is currently implemented for class names passed to `ReflectionClass` in the `MetadataExtractor` component."
*   Example: "Partial format validation exists for method names used with `ReflectionMethod`, but it's not comprehensive and doesn't use a whitelist."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Whitelist for type hints used in `DocBlockFactory::createInstance()` is missing, allowing potentially malicious type hints to be processed."
*   Example: "Format validation for class names is missing before using `FqsenResolver` in the `ConfigurationParser`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Contextual Access Control (Reflection-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/contextual_access_control__reflection-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify `reflection-common` Usage:** Locate all code points where `phpDocumentor/reflection-common` functions or classes are used.
2.  **Define Access Rules:** For *each* usage point, determine the necessary permissions or context (user roles, authentication, etc.) required to allow that specific reflection operation.
3.  **Implement Pre-Reflection Checks:** *Before* calling any `reflection-common` function, implement checks to verify that the current context meets the defined access requirements.
4.  **Deny Unauthorized Reflection:** If access is denied, prevent the `reflection-common` call. Throw an exception, log the attempt, and return a generic error.
5. **Blacklist Sensitive Components (Reflection Context):** Create a list of classes, methods, properties, or type patterns that should *never* be reflected upon using `reflection-common`, regardless of user permissions.  Block these explicitly.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Reflection-Specific):** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information exposed through `reflection-common`, even with some input control.
*   **Privilege Escalation (via Reflection):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from using `reflection-common` to bypass security and access restricted functionality.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced, depending on access control granularity.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "No access control checks are performed before using `reflection-common` in the `ApiDocGenerator`."
*   Example: "Basic role-based checks exist before some reflection operations, but they are not consistently applied."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Access control is missing before using `DocBlockFactory` to parse docblocks, potentially allowing unauthorized access to docblock information."
*   Example: "No blacklist of sensitive components exists to prevent reflection on internal classes using `reflection-common`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling (Reflection-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling__reflection-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Wrap `reflection-common` Calls:** Enclose all calls to `phpDocumentor/reflection-common` functions and classes within `try...catch` blocks.
2.  **Catch Reflection Exceptions:** Specifically catch exceptions that can be thrown by `reflection-common`, such as those related to invalid types or parsing errors.  Consult the `reflection-common` documentation for the specific exception types.
3.  **Secure Error Handling (Reflection Context):**
    *   *Never* expose raw exception messages or stack traces from `reflection-common` to the user.
    *   Log the error details securely, including the specific `reflection-common` function called, the input provided, and any relevant context.
    *   Return a generic error message to the user.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (via Error Messages):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents sensitive information from being leaked through error messages generated by `reflection-common`.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Some `try...catch` blocks are present around `reflection-common` calls, but error messages are not always sanitized."
*   Example: "No specific exception handling for `reflection-common` errors is implemented in the `TypeResolver` component."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Exceptions from `DocBlockFactory::createInstance()` are not caught, potentially exposing internal details to the user."
*   Example: "Error logging for `reflection-common` failures is inconsistent and doesn't always include sufficient context."
