# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a stable and reliable PHP reflection library for use in other PHP projects, such as documentation generators, static analysis tools, and IDEs.
  - Ensure compatibility with various PHP versions to maximize usability across different projects.
  - Maintain the library as an open-source project, fostering community contributions and ensuring long-term availability.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities within the library could be inherited by dependent projects, potentially leading to security breaches in those projects.
  - Breaking changes introduced in new versions could cause compatibility issues and disrupt the functionality of dependent projects, leading to developer frustration and potential project delays.
  - Lack of maintenance and updates could result in the library becoming outdated, incompatible with newer PHP versions, and vulnerable to newly discovered security threats.
  - Poor performance or resource consumption could negatively impact the performance of dependent projects.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository hosting with standard GitHub security features (e.g., vulnerability scanning for dependencies). Implemented by: GitHub platform.
  - security control: Open-source development model with community review (implicit code review by contributors and users). Implemented by: Open-source nature of the project.
  - security control: Use of Composer for dependency management, leveraging Packagist as a package repository. Implemented by: Project build and distribution process.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities due to the complexity of code and the open-source development model.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes and updates, which may have variable response times.
  - accepted risk: Supply chain risks associated with dependencies managed by Composer and Packagist.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the project.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, focusing on critical components and areas prone to vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization practices to mitigate injection vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Authentication is relevant for systems that use this library, but not for the library itself.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Authorization is relevant for systems that use this library, but not for the library itself.
  - Input Validation: The library should perform robust input validation to ensure that it can safely handle various types of PHP code and user-provided input without leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This is especially important when reflecting on code provided by external sources.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable for the core functionality of a reflection library. However, if the library were to handle sensitive data or configuration (which is not the case for `reflectioncommon`), cryptographic measures would be relevant.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing reliable and secure reflection capabilities to dependent PHP projects.
  - Maintaining the stability and compatibility of the library to avoid breaking changes for users.
  - Ensuring the long-term availability and maintenance of the library as an open-source project.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the `reflectioncommon` library: Medium sensitivity. Confidentiality is less critical for open-source, but integrity and availability are important.
  - PHP code being reflected upon by users of the library: High sensitivity. This code can contain business logic, sensitive data, and intellectual property. The library must handle this input securely to prevent information leakage or vulnerabilities in user applications.
  - Package artifacts on Packagist: Medium sensitivity. Integrity and availability are crucial to ensure users download legitimate and functional packages.
