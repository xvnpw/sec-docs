## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Type Resolution Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_type_resolution_logic.md)

An attacker aims to exploit flaws within the type resolution logic of `phpdocumentor/typeresolver` to cause unintended behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Type Confusion leading to Exploitable Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/cause_type_confusion_leading_to_exploitable_behavior.md)

The attacker manipulates input to `typeresolver` causing it to misinterpret the type of a variable or parameter, leading to exploitable behavior in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Input to Typeresolver](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_input_to_typeresolver.md)

The attacker provides crafted input to the `typeresolver` library to influence its type resolution process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious DocBlock Comments](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_docblock_comments.md)

An attacker crafts specific DocBlock comments containing unexpected type hints, complex structures, or potentially even code snippets designed to trick `typeresolver` into inferring incorrect types or triggering parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Malicious PHP Code Snippets for Analysis](./attack_tree_paths/provide_malicious_php_code_snippets_for_analysis.md)

If the application uses `typeresolver` to analyze PHP code snippets (e.g., for static analysis or code generation), an attacker can provide malicious code snippets that, when analyzed, lead to incorrect type inference or trigger vulnerabilities in the resolver's parsing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Uses Incorrectly Resolved Type in a Vulnerable Way](./attack_tree_paths/application_uses_incorrectly_resolved_type_in_a_vulnerable_way.md)

The application uses the incorrect type information provided by `typeresolver` in a way that creates a security vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type is used in security-sensitive operations (e.g., access control, deserialization)](./attack_tree_paths/type_is_used_in_security-sensitive_operations__e_g___access_control__deserialization_.md)

Building upon type confusion, this path specifically targets scenarios where the application uses the incorrectly resolved type in security-critical operations. For example, if access control decisions are based on the resolved type of a user object, an attacker might manipulate the input to make `typeresolver` infer an administrator type for a regular user, bypassing access restrictions. Similarly, incorrect type inference during deserialization could lead to the instantiation of malicious objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type is used to instantiate objects or call methods dynamically](./attack_tree_paths/type_is_used_to_instantiate_objects_or_call_methods_dynamically.md)

In applications that dynamically instantiate objects or call methods based on the types resolved by `typeresolver`, an attacker can exploit type confusion to force the instantiation of malicious classes or the invocation of unintended methods. This can lead to remote code execution or other severe vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Potential Code Injection via Type Resolution (Less Likely, More Severe)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_potential_code_injection_via_type_resolution__less_likely__more_severe_.md)

If `typeresolver` itself has a vulnerability where it internally processes or executes code based on the resolved types (e.g., using `eval()` or similar constructs), an attacker who can control the input could inject malicious code that gets executed within the application's context. This is a severe vulnerability within the library itself, rather than the application's usage of it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Typeresolver Internally Processes or Executes Code Based on Resolved Types](./attack_tree_paths/typeresolver_internally_processes_or_executes_code_based_on_resolved_types.md)

This is a hypothetical but critical vulnerability within the `typeresolver` library. If the library internally uses constructs like `eval()` based on the resolved types, an attacker who can influence the resolved types through malicious input could achieve arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Controls the Input Leading to Malicious Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_controls_the_input_leading_to_malicious_code_execution.md)

This node represents the successful exploitation of a code injection vulnerability through `typeresolver`. The attacker manipulates the input in such a way that the type resolution process leads to the execution of attacker-controlled code within the application's environment.
