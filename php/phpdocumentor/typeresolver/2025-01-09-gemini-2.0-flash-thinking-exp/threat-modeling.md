# Threat Model Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Threat: [Complex Type Hint Denial of Service](./threats/complex_type_hint_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input code with extremely complex or deeply nested type hints that, when processed by the type resolver, consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial of service. The attacker doesn't need to inject malicious code, but rather exploit the computational complexity of resolving certain type hint structures. This directly targets the resource consumption of the `typeresolver` library itself.

**Impact:** The application or the process running the type resolver could become unresponsive or crash due to resource exhaustion. This would disrupt the functionality that relies on type resolution.

**Affected Component:** Resolver module (specifically the logic for resolving complex type intersections, unions, and generics).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement timeouts for the type resolution process to prevent indefinite resource consumption within the `typeresolver` library.
*   Monitor resource usage during type resolution and implement safeguards if thresholds are exceeded within the `typeresolver`'s execution context.
*   Consider limiting the complexity of type hints allowed in the application's coding standards to reduce the load on the `typeresolver`.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Dependency Library](./threats/vulnerability_in_dependency_library.md)

**Description:** The `phpdocumentor/typeresolver` library relies on other third-party libraries. If any of these dependencies have known *critical* security vulnerabilities *that directly affect the functionality of typeresolver*, an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities through the `typeresolver`. This is considered a direct involvement if the vulnerable dependency's flaw can be triggered through `typeresolver`'s normal operation.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range to remote code execution if a critical vulnerability exists in a dependency that `typeresolver` directly utilizes in a vulnerable way.

**Affected Component:** Potentially any module within `typeresolver` that utilizes the vulnerable dependency and exposes the vulnerability. The specific component depends on the vulnerable library and how `typeresolver` uses it.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the `phpdocumentor/typeresolver` library and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Use dependency management tools (like Composer) that can identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Consider using tools that perform static analysis or security audits of dependencies used by `typeresolver`.
