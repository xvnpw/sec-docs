# Attack Surface Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Type Hint Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_type_hint_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manages to inject malicious or unexpected strings into locations where type hints are defined (e.g., docblock comments, PHP 8 attributes).
    * **How Typeresolver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `typeresolver` is the component responsible for parsing and interpreting these type hint strings. If it encounters a maliciously crafted string, it might lead to unexpected behavior or resource consumption.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a docblock comment to include an extremely long and complex type hint like `array<array<array<array<...>>>>` or a type hint with unusual characters.
    * **Impact:**
        * Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive parsing time or memory consumption.
        * Logic errors in the application if the type resolver misinterprets the malicious type hint, leading to incorrect assumptions about variable types.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Source Code Management:** Implement strict access controls and integrity checks for source code repositories to prevent unauthorized modifications of docblocks and attributes.
        * **Input Sanitization (Indirect):** While you don't directly sanitize input *to* `typeresolver`, ensure the systems or processes that *generate* or store the source code containing type hints are secure.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Review code and infrastructure for potential injection points that could allow modification of type hint definitions.
