* **Attack Surface:** Maliciously Crafted Type Declarations Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)

    * **Description:** The `TypeResolver` library parses strings representing PHP type declarations. An attacker could provide an extremely complex, deeply nested, or syntactically ambiguous type declaration designed to overwhelm the parser.
    * **How TypeResolver Contributes:** The library's core function is to parse these declarations. If the parsing logic is not robust enough to handle maliciously crafted input, it can lead to excessive resource consumption.
    * **Example:**  Providing a type declaration like `array<array<array<array<array<array<array<array<array<array<int>>>>>>>>>>` or a declaration with excessive use of union or intersection types.
    * **Impact:**  Application slowdown, increased CPU and memory usage, potential application crashes, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Length Limits:** Implement limits on the maximum length of type declaration strings accepted by the application before passing them to `TypeResolver`.
        * **Complexity Analysis (Application-Level):**  Before using `TypeResolver`, implement application-level checks to identify and reject overly complex type declarations based on nesting depth or the number of combined types.
        * **Timeouts:**  If possible, implement timeouts when calling `TypeResolver` functions to prevent indefinite processing of malicious input.
        * **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement alerts to detect potential DoS attacks.

* **Attack Surface:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Parsing Logic

    * **Description:** If `TypeResolver` uses regular expressions internally for parsing type declarations, a specially crafted input string could exploit backtracking behavior in the regex engine, leading to exponential processing time.
    * **How TypeResolver Contributes:** The library's internal parsing mechanisms, if relying on vulnerable regular expressions, become the entry point for this attack.
    * **Example:**  A type declaration like `(int|string|float|bool|null|resource|object|array)*` could potentially cause ReDoS if the underlying regex is not carefully constructed.
    * **Impact:**  Significant performance degradation, application hangs, and potential denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Review TypeResolver Code (If Possible):** If access to the `TypeResolver` source code is available, review the regular expressions used for parsing and identify potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
        * **Update TypeResolver:** Keep the `TypeResolver` library updated to the latest version, as maintainers may have addressed ReDoS vulnerabilities in newer releases.
        * **Consider Alternative Parsing Methods (If Applicable):** If feasible, explore alternative parsing techniques within the application that don't rely on potentially vulnerable regular expressions before using `TypeResolver`.
