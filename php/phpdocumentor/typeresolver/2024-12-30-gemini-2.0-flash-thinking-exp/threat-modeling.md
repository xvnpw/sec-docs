Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving `phpdocumentor/typeresolver`:

* **Threat:** Malicious Type String Injection via Docblocks
    * **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the docblock content of PHP code processed by the application, injecting malicious type strings. When `typeresolver` parses this code, it will attempt to resolve these crafted types. This could involve using special characters, unexpected syntax, or references to non-existent or malicious classes/namespaces.
    * **Impact:** Successful injection could lead to `typeresolver` returning incorrect type information. If the application relies on this for critical decisions like input validation or object instantiation, it could be bypassed, leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other security vulnerabilities.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `phpDocumentor\Reflection\DocBlock\Tag::getType()`
        * `phpDocumentor\TypeResolver\TypeResolver::resolve()`
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Input Sanitization: Sanitize or validate the source of the docblock content before it's processed by `typeresolver`.
        * Strict Type Checking: Implement robust type checking within the application logic, even after type resolution.
        * Code Review: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential injection points.
        * Limit Processing Scope: If possible, limit the scope of code that `typeresolver` processes to trusted sources.
