# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `phpdocumentor/typeresolver`, aims to provide a robust and accurate PHP type resolution library. This library is intended to be used by other software, primarily PHP development tools such as static analyzers, IDEs, and documentation generators.

*   Business Priorities:
    *   Accuracy of type resolution: The primary goal is to correctly identify and resolve PHP types to ensure the reliability of tools that depend on this information.
    *   Performance: The library should be efficient to avoid slowing down the performance of the tools that integrate it.
    *   Maintainability: The codebase should be well-structured and maintainable to allow for ongoing updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.
    *   Compatibility: The library needs to be compatible with various PHP versions and coding styles to be widely adopted.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Inaccurate type resolution: If the library incorrectly resolves types, it can lead to errors and incorrect behavior in the tools that use it, potentially impacting developer productivity and code quality.
    *   Performance bottlenecks: Slow type resolution can negatively impact the performance of integrated tools, leading to a poor user experience.
    *   Lack of adoption: If the library is not reliable, performant, or easy to use, it may not be adopted by the PHP development community, reducing its impact and value.
    *   Security vulnerabilities: Although not a primary business driver for a library, security vulnerabilities could indirectly affect tools that use it, potentially leading to security issues in those tools.

# SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing security controls:
    *   security control: Public GitHub repository with issue tracking and pull request review process. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
    *   security control: Open-source development model allowing community contributions and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub repository)

*   Accepted risks:
    *   accepted risk: As a library, direct exposure to end-users and external threats is limited. The primary risk is vulnerabilities affecting dependent tools.
    *   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.

*   Recommended security controls:
    *   security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
    *   security control: Regularly update dependencies, including the PHP parser and any other external libraries, to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   security control: Consider incorporating fuzz testing to identify edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in the type parsing logic, especially when handling complex or unusual PHP code structures.
    *   security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.

*   Security Requirements:
    *   Authentication: Not applicable. This library is not directly involved in authentication processes.
    *   Authorization: Not applicable. This library does not handle authorization.
    *   Input Validation:
        *   security requirement: The library must robustly handle various forms of PHP code as input, including potentially malformed or unexpected syntax.
        *   security requirement: Input validation should be implemented to prevent unexpected behavior or errors when processing unusual or edge-case PHP code structures. This is crucial to maintain stability and prevent potential denial-of-service or logic vulnerabilities.
    *   Cryptography: Not applicable. Cryptography is not a core requirement for a type resolution library.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of PHP type resolution for dependent tools.
    *   Maintaining the performance of PHP Development Tools that rely on the library.
    *   Maintaining the reputation and trustworthiness of the `phpdocumentor` project and its libraries.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   The TypeResolver Library processes PHP code, which can contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials, business logic).
    *   While the library itself does not store or manage this sensitive data, vulnerabilities in the library could potentially be exploited by malicious PHP code to gain access to or manipulate sensitive information within the context of a PHP Development Tool.
    *   Data sensitivity is considered moderate to high, depending on the context and the sensitivity of the PHP code being analyzed by tools using this library.
