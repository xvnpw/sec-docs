## Attack Tree Path: [1. Root Goal: Compromise Application via TypeResolver Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__root_goal_compromise_application_via_typeresolver_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's ultimate objective is to gain unauthorized access or control over the application utilizing `phpdocumentor/typeresolver`. This could involve data breaches, service disruption, or complete system takeover.
*   **Significance:** This is the starting point and overarching objective of all attack paths. Success here represents a complete security failure from the application's perspective.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the application handles input, specifically when that input is used to construct or influence type strings processed by `phpdocumentor/typeresolver`.
*   **Significance:** Input handling is a common and often vulnerable area in web applications. If type strings are derived from or influenced by user input, this becomes a high-risk attack surface. Successful exploitation here can lead to various sub-attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Malicious Type String Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__malicious_type_string_injection__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector involves injecting crafted, malicious type strings into the application's processing flow, aiming to manipulate the behavior of `phpdocumentor/typeresolver` and subsequently the application itself.
*   **Significance:** This is the core mechanism for exploiting input handling vulnerabilities related to `typeresolver`. If an attacker can inject malicious type strings, they can potentially trigger type confusion, DoS, or even indirect code injection scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Type Confusion leading to Application Logic Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__type_confusion_leading_to_application_logic_bypass__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** By injecting malicious type strings, an attacker attempts to cause `phpdocumentor/typeresolver` to resolve types incorrectly, leading to type confusion within the application's logic. This confusion can then be exploited to bypass security checks or alter intended application behavior.
*   **Significance:** Type confusion can have serious security implications if the application relies on type information for critical functions like authentication, authorization, or data validation.
    *   **4.1. Misinterpretation of User Input Types [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:**  The application uses `typeresolver` to interpret or validate user input types. A malicious type string can cause the application to misinterpret the actual type of user-provided data.
        *   **Significance:** This misinterpretation can lead to bypassing type-based security checks or incorrect data processing.

            *   **4.1.1. Bypass Authentication/Authorization Checks [CRITICAL NODE]**
                *   **Description:**  The application uses resolved type information to determine user roles or permissions. By manipulating the resolved type associated with a user (via malicious type string injection), an attacker attempts to elevate privileges or bypass authorization controls.
                *   **Significance:** Successful bypass of authentication or authorization is a critical security breach, granting unauthorized access to sensitive resources and functionalities.

    *   **4.2. Data Type Mismatch leading to Unexpected Behavior [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:** Incorrect type resolution due to malicious type strings leads to data type mismatches within the application's internal processing.
        *   **Significance:** Data type mismatches can cause a range of issues, from data corruption and application errors to information disclosure, depending on how the application handles these mismatches.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploiting Input Source Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploiting_input_source_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on the source of the type strings. If the application derives type strings from user-controlled sources, it significantly increases the likelihood and impact of input handling vulnerabilities.
*   **Significance:** User-controlled input sources are inherently more vulnerable as attackers can directly manipulate the data.
    *   **5.1. If Type Strings are Derived from User-Controlled Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:** The application constructs type strings based on data originating from sources directly controllable by the user.
        *   **Significance:** This makes the application highly susceptible to malicious type string injection attacks.

            *   **5.1.1. HTTP Request Parameters (GET/POST) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Description:** Type strings are directly taken from HTTP GET or POST parameters.
                *   **Significance:** HTTP parameters are easily manipulated by attackers, making this a very direct and high-risk input source.

            *   **5.1.2. Cookies [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                *   **Description:** Type strings are stored in cookies, which can be modified by the user or attacker.
                *   **Significance:** Cookies, while slightly less direct than URL parameters, are still user-controllable and represent a significant input source vulnerability if used to derive type strings.
