# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Type Declarations processed by `typeresolver`](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_type_declarations_processed_by__typeresolver_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Strict Type Declaration Whitelist:**  Establish a clear and restrictive whitelist of allowed type declaration structures and formats that your application will permit to be processed by `typeresolver`. This whitelist should be based on the actual type resolution needs of your application and exclude overly complex or potentially ambiguous type constructs that could be exploited.
    2.  **Implement Pre-processing Validation:** Before passing any type declaration string to `typeresolver` for resolution, implement a validation step. This step should rigorously check the input string against the defined whitelist. Utilize regular expressions, schema validation, or custom parsing logic to enforce adherence to the allowed type structures.
    3.  **Reject Non-Compliant Type Declarations:** If an input type declaration fails the validation process, immediately reject it.  Prevent it from being processed by `typeresolver`. Return an error or log the rejection for security monitoring purposes.
    4.  **Sanitize Docblock Content Before `typeresolver` Processing (If Applicable):** If `typeresolver` is used to analyze docblocks that might contain user-provided or externally sourced content, implement sanitization of the docblock text *before* it is processed by `typeresolver`. Focus on removing or escaping any potentially harmful characters or markup within the docblock that could be misinterpreted or exploited during the type resolution process.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Type Declaration Injection Exploiting `typeresolver` Parsing (High Severity):**  Attackers could inject maliciously crafted type declarations specifically designed to exploit potential parsing vulnerabilities within `typeresolver` itself. This could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or potentially more severe security issues if `typeresolver` is vulnerable.
        *   **Denial of Service via Complex Type Declarations (Medium Severity):**  Maliciously complex or deeply nested type declarations could be crafted to cause `typeresolver` to consume excessive computational resources (CPU, memory) during parsing and resolution, leading to a denial of service.
        *   **Unexpected Behavior or Errors from Invalid Type Declarations (Low to Medium Severity):**  Invalid or unexpected type declarations, even if not intentionally malicious, could cause `typeresolver` to produce incorrect or unpredictable results, or throw exceptions, potentially disrupting application logic that relies on the output of `typeresolver`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Type Declaration Injection Exploiting `typeresolver` Parsing:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing malicious or unexpected input from reaching `typeresolver`'s parsing engine. Effective validation can almost entirely eliminate this threat.
        *   **Denial of Service via Complex Type Declarations:** Reduces the risk by limiting the complexity and allowed formats of input processed by `typeresolver`, making it harder to craft resource-intensive type declarations.
        *   **Unexpected Behavior or Errors from Invalid Type Declarations:** Reduces the risk of application instability or incorrect behavior caused by `typeresolver` processing invalid input, leading to more predictable and reliable application functionality.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Partial Input Validation in API Layer (General Data Types):**  Input validation exists in the API layer, but it is primarily focused on general data type and format validation for API parameters and does not currently include specific validation rules for type declaration strings intended for `typeresolver`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Dedicated Type Declaration Validation for `typeresolver`:**  Specific validation logic tailored to the expected format and structure of type declarations processed by `typeresolver` is missing. This validation needs to be implemented at the point where type declarations are received or constructed before being passed to `typeresolver`.
        *   **Docblock Sanitization Before `typeresolver` Processing:** Sanitization of docblock content is not implemented in areas where user-provided or external content might be included in docblocks that are subsequently processed by `typeresolver`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Management and Timeouts for `typeresolver` Operations](./mitigation_strategies/resource_management_and_timeouts_for__typeresolver__operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Operation Timeouts for `typeresolver` Calls:**  Whenever calling functions within the `typeresolver` library, especially when processing type declarations that originate from external or untrusted sources, implement operation timeouts. Set a reasonable maximum execution time for each `typeresolver` operation.
    2.  **Enforce Timeouts:** If a `typeresolver` operation exceeds the defined timeout, interrupt the operation and handle the timeout event gracefully. Prevent the operation from continuing to consume resources indefinitely.
    3.  **Resource Limits Specific to `typeresolver` Processes (If Possible):** If your environment allows for fine-grained resource control, consider setting resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory limits) specifically for the processes or threads that are executing `typeresolver` operations. This can provide an additional layer of protection against resource exhaustion.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion in `typeresolver` (High Severity):**  Attackers could exploit potential inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in `typeresolver`'s processing logic by providing input that causes it to consume excessive CPU time, memory, or other resources, leading to a denial of service for the application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion in `typeresolver`:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the maximum resources that any single `typeresolver` operation can consume. Timeouts and resource limits prevent runaway processes and ensure application availability even if `typeresolver` encounters problematic input.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **General Request Timeouts (Web Server Level):**  General request timeouts are configured at the web server level, which can indirectly limit the overall execution time of requests that involve `typeresolver`. However, these are not specific to individual `typeresolver` operations within the application code.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Operation-Level Timeouts for `typeresolver` Function Calls:**  Explicit timeouts need to be implemented directly in the application code around calls to `typeresolver` functions, especially when processing external or untrusted input. This ensures that individual type resolution operations are bounded in time.
        *   **Fine-grained Resource Limits for `typeresolver` Processes:**  Specific resource limits for processes executing `typeresolver` operations are not currently implemented. This would require more advanced process management capabilities within the application environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling and Information Disclosure Prevention around `typeresolver`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling_and_information_disclosure_prevention_around__typeresolver_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Try-Catch Blocks around `typeresolver` Calls:**  Wrap all calls to `typeresolver` functions within try-catch blocks or use appropriate error handling mechanisms to intercept any exceptions or errors that `typeresolver` might throw during processing.
    2.  **Generic Error Messages for User-Facing Errors:** When errors occur during type resolution that are exposed to end-users (if any), display generic, non-revealing error messages. Avoid exposing detailed error messages, stack traces, or internal application details that could leak sensitive information or aid attackers in understanding the application's internals.
    3.  **Secure and Detailed Error Logging for Internal Use:** Log detailed error information, including stack traces, original type declaration input, and relevant context, securely for internal debugging, monitoring, and security analysis. Ensure that error logs are stored in a secure location with restricted access.
    4.  **Sanitize Error Messages in Logs (If Necessary):** If error messages from `typeresolver` or the application code must be logged, sanitize them to remove or mask any potentially sensitive information, such as file paths, internal variable names, or code snippets that could be exploited by attackers if logs are compromised.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via `typeresolver` Error Messages (Low to Medium Severity):**  Detailed error messages generated by `typeresolver` or the application's error handling of `typeresolver` could inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the application's internal structure, code paths, or dependencies to potential attackers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via `typeresolver` Error Messages:** Reduces the risk by preventing the exposure of sensitive internal application details through user-facing error messages and by ensuring that detailed error information is logged securely for internal use only.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **General Error Handling (Application-Wide):**  General error handling mechanisms are in place throughout the application, but they may not be specifically tailored to handle errors originating from `typeresolver` in a security-conscious manner.
        *   **Generic Error Pages for Unhandled Exceptions:** Generic error pages are displayed to users for unhandled exceptions, but the level of detail in logged errors might still be too verbose and potentially disclose sensitive information.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Specific Error Handling for `typeresolver` Errors:**  Error handling logic needs to be specifically reviewed and enhanced around calls to `typeresolver` to ensure that user-facing errors are generic and non-revealing, while detailed error information is logged securely for internal use.
        *   **Error Message Sanitization in Logs:**  Sanitization of error messages logged internally is not currently implemented. Logged error messages might still contain sensitive information that should be removed or masked to minimize potential information leakage if logs are compromised.
