# Attack Surface Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Attack Surface: [Input Injection through Malicious Type Strings](./attack_surfaces/input_injection_through_malicious_type_strings.md)

*   **Description:** When an application uses `typeresolver` to parse type strings originating from untrusted sources, attackers can inject specially crafted strings. These strings are designed to exploit vulnerabilities or trigger resource exhaustion during `typeresolver`'s parsing process.

*   **How `typeresolver` directly contributes to the attack surface:** `typeresolver`'s core function is parsing type strings. If it processes untrusted, unsanitized input, it becomes the direct component exposed to injection attacks targeting its parsing logic.

*   **Example:** An attacker provides a deeply nested and complex type string like `array{a: array{b: array{c: ... (nested many levels)... } } }` as input to a function that uses `typeresolver` to validate or process types. This excessive nesting can cause `typeresolver` to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to a Denial of Service.

*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Logic Errors.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *before* passing any type string to `typeresolver`. Define and enforce strict limits on the complexity and structure of allowed type strings (e.g., maximum nesting depth, allowed characters, disallowed type constructs).
    *   **Contextual Usage Review and Restriction:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of external, untrusted sources for type strings. If external sources are necessary, implement strong access controls and validation at the source itself.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement application-level resource limits (e.g., timeouts) for operations involving `typeresolver` to prevent unbounded resource consumption in case of malicious input.
    *   **Error Handling and Safe Fallback:** Implement robust error handling around `typeresolver` calls. In case of parsing errors or exceptions, fail safely and avoid exposing error details that could aid attackers.

## Attack Surface: [Parsing Vulnerabilities within `typeresolver`](./attack_surfaces/parsing_vulnerabilities_within__typeresolver_.md)

*   **Description:**  `typeresolver` itself, being a parsing library, may contain inherent vulnerabilities in its code. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by specific, potentially malformed or unexpected type strings, leading to unintended behavior within the library.

*   **How `typeresolver` directly contributes to the attack surface:** The attack surface is directly within `typeresolver`'s code. Any parsing bugs, memory safety issues, or logical flaws in `typeresolver`'s implementation become potential vulnerabilities for applications using it.

*   **Example:** A specific combination of union types and generic types in a crafted type string, when processed by a vulnerable version of `typeresolver`, could trigger a bug leading to a crash, infinite loop, or in a worst-case scenario, potentially memory corruption (though less likely in PHP's managed memory environment, but still a theoretical risk if underlying C extensions are involved).

*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Potential (though less probable in PHP) Code Execution.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates are Critical:**  Immediately update `typeresolver` to the latest stable version. Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched. Staying up-to-date is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Dependency Monitoring and Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `phpdocumentor/typeresolver`. Subscribe to security mailing lists or use tools that alert you to dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider Static Analysis and Fuzzing (Advanced):** For applications with extremely high security requirements, consider employing static analysis tools or fuzzing techniques on `typeresolver` itself to proactively identify potential parsing vulnerabilities. This is more relevant for library maintainers and highly security-conscious users.
    *   **Sandboxing (Application Level for Untrusted Input):** If the application processes type strings from highly untrusted or completely external sources, consider isolating the `typeresolver` parsing process within a sandboxed environment to limit the potential impact of any exploited vulnerability within `typeresolver` itself. This adds a layer of containment.
