# Threat Model Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Complex Type String Parsing](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__-_complex_type_string_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts and submits extremely complex or deeply nested type strings to the application. The `phpdocumentor/typeresolver` library, when attempting to parse these maliciously crafted strings, consumes excessive computational resources (CPU, memory). This resource exhaustion can lead to significant application slowdown, unresponsiveness, or a complete denial of service, effectively preventing legitimate users from accessing the application. The attacker might automate this process by sending a high volume of these complex type strings to maximize the impact and cause widespread service disruption.
**Impact:**  Application becomes unavailable or severely degraded for legitimate users.  Service outage leading to business disruption, potential financial losses, and reputational damage. In critical systems, this could have significant operational consequences.
**Affected Component:** Parser module, specifically the core type string parsing engine within `phpdocumentor/typeresolver`.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Input validation and complexity limits: Implement strict validation on incoming type strings *before* they are processed by `typeresolver`.  Enforce limits on the maximum length and nesting depth of type strings to prevent excessively complex inputs from reaching the parser.
    * Rate limiting: If type resolution is triggered by user input or external requests, implement rate limiting to restrict the number of type resolution requests from a single source within a given timeframe. This can help mitigate automated DoS attempts.
    * Resource limits and monitoring: Configure appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory) for the application server or container to contain the impact of resource exhaustion. Implement monitoring to detect unusual resource consumption patterns that might indicate a DoS attack.
    * Regular updates and security patches: Keep `phpdocumentor/typeresolver` updated to the latest version. Security updates and patches may address performance issues or vulnerabilities that could be exploited for DoS attacks.
    * Timeout mechanisms: Implement timeouts for the type resolution process. If parsing takes longer than an acceptable threshold, terminate the process to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
