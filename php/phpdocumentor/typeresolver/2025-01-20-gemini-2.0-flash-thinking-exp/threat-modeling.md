# Threat Model Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Threat: [Malicious Docblock Injection Leading to Type Confusion](./threats/malicious_docblock_injection_leading_to_type_confusion.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially through indirect means like influencing code stored in a database or file system that is later analyzed, crafts malicious or ambiguous docblock comments. The `typeresolver` library parses these crafted docblocks, leading to incorrect type resolution. This could involve injecting misleading type hints or exploiting edge cases in the parser.

**Impact:** Incorrect type resolution can lead to logic errors in the application, bypassing intended security checks, or causing unexpected behavior due to incorrect assumptions about data types. This could potentially lead to vulnerabilities like privilege escalation or data manipulation in other parts of the application that rely on the resolved types.

**Affected Component:** Docblock Parser

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize or validate any input that influences the code being analyzed by `typeresolver`, especially docblock content.
*   Treat code from untrusted sources with extreme caution and avoid using `typeresolver` on it directly without thorough inspection.
*   Implement robust input validation in the application logic that relies on the types resolved by `typeresolver` as a secondary defense.
