## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Type Hints](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_type_hints.md)

An attacker attempts to embed malicious code or control characters within the type hints provided as input to the `typeresolver` library. This could involve crafting strings that, when processed, lead to unintended consequences.

**Focus:** This node is critical because it represents the initial point of entry for injecting malicious content that can be further exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Code within Type Hints](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_code_within_type_hints.md)

If the application using `typeresolver` subsequently evaluates or uses the resolved type hints in a dynamic or unsafe manner, an attacker can inject executable code.
    * **Inject PHP Code Snippets:** The attacker crafts type hints containing PHP code (e.g., using functions like `eval()`, `system()`, or other potentially dangerous constructs). If the application then executes this resolved type hint as PHP code, it leads to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
    * **Inject OS Commands:**  Similar to PHP code injection, if the resolved type hint is used in a context where it's interpreted as an operating system command (e.g., passed to a function like `exec()` or `shell_exec()`), the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities (Application-Side)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_output_handling_vulnerabilities__application-side_.md)

This node highlights vulnerabilities in how the application *uses* the type information resolved by `typeresolver`. Even if `typeresolver` itself doesn't have vulnerabilities, the application's logic in handling its output can be exploited.

**Focus:** This node is critical because it represents a broad category of vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between `typeresolver`'s output and the application's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Application Logic via Incorrect Type Resolution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_application_logic_via_incorrect_type_resolution.md)

An attacker crafts input that causes `typeresolver` to resolve a type incorrectly or in an unexpected way. The application, relying on this faulty type information, then executes logic based on this incorrect assumption.
    * **Cause Type Confusion:** By manipulating the input, the attacker can cause the application to treat an object or data as a different type than it actually is. This can lead to unexpected behavior, security breaches, or the ability to bypass access controls.
    * **Bypass Security Checks:** If security checks within the application rely on the resolved type information, an attacker might be able to manipulate the input to `typeresolver` to produce a type that bypasses these checks, granting unauthorized access or privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Unsafe Usage of Resolved Types](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_unsafe_usage_of_resolved_types.md)

The application uses the resolved type information in operations that are inherently unsafe without proper sanitization or validation.
    * **Inject Class/Method Names:** If the application uses the resolved type information to dynamically construct class or method names (e.g., using variable class names or method calls), an attacker can inject malicious names, leading to the instantiation of unintended classes or the execution of arbitrary methods.
    * **Inject Data used in SQL queries:** If the resolved type information is incorporated into SQL queries without proper parameterization or escaping, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities and potential data breaches.
    * **Inject Data used in OS commands:** If the resolved type information is used to construct operating system commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands, leading to command injection vulnerabilities and the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
