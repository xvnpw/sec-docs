# Attack Surface Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Attack Surface: [Parsing of Malicious Type Declarations](./attack_surfaces/parsing_of_malicious_type_declarations.md)

* **Description:**  `typeresolver` parses PHP type declarations. If the application uses it to analyze type hints from untrusted sources (e.g., user-provided code snippets, external configuration), crafted malicious type declarations could exploit vulnerabilities in the library's parsing logic.
    * **How Typeresolver Contributes:** The library's core function is parsing these declarations. Vulnerabilities in the parser can be directly triggered by providing specially crafted input.
    * **Example:** An application allows users to upload PHP code snippets for analysis. An attacker crafts a type declaration with an extremely long or deeply nested structure. When `typeresolver` attempts to parse this, it could lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory), causing a Denial of Service (DoS). Alternatively, a bug in the parser could be triggered, leading to unexpected behavior or even code execution within the parsing context *during the type resolution process*.
    * **Impact:** High - Denial of Service, potential for unexpected behavior or information disclosure *within the type resolution process*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid using `typeresolver` on type declarations from untrusted sources.** If necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of type declaration strings *before* passing them to the library. This could involve limiting the length and complexity of type declarations.
        * **Implement resource limits** (e.g., time limits, memory limits) for the type resolution process to mitigate DoS attacks caused by complex type declarations.
        * **Keep `typeresolver` updated** to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the parsing logic.

It's important to note that while other attack surfaces might involve `typeresolver` indirectly, the above element directly stems from the library's core functionality of parsing and interpreting type declarations.
