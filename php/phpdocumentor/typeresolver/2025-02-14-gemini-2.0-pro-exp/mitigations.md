# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Type Complexity](./mitigation_strategies/limit_type_complexity.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Type Complexity

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Determine all locations in the code where type strings are passed *directly* to `TypeResolver`. This is where the type string originates *before* being processed by the library.
    2.  **Implement Pre-Processing Checks:** *Before* calling `TypeResolver::resolve()` (or other relevant methods), add a pre-processing step that analyzes the raw type string. This step should include:
        *   **Nesting Depth Check:** Recursively analyze the type string to count the maximum nesting level of arrays, generics, and parenthesized expressions. Reject the input if the depth exceeds a predefined limit (e.g., 5).
        *   **Union/Intersection Count Check:** Count the number of `|` (union) and `&` (intersection) operators. Reject if the count exceeds a limit (e.g., 10).
        *   **Array Shape Key Count Check:** If array shapes are used (`array{key1: type1, ...}`), count the keys. Reject if the count exceeds a limit (e.g., 20).
        *   **Suspicious Pattern Check:** Use regular expressions to detect and reject obviously malicious patterns (e.g., excessively long type names, repeated type combinations).
    3.  **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling for rejected types *at the point of input*. This might involve logging, returning a default/safe type, or throwing an exception *before* `TypeResolver` is even invoked.
    4.  **Configuration:** Consider making the limits (nesting depth, etc.) configurable.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Types:** (Severity: High) - Prevents `TypeResolver` from processing overly complex types that could cause excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: High) - Directly prevents `TypeResolver` from being the cause of resource exhaustion due to malicious input.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS by preventing the library from even attempting to process malicious input.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Prevents `TypeResolver` from being the direct cause of resource exhaustion.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `src/TypeParser.php`. Nesting depth check exists (limit of 3), but other checks are missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `src/TypeParser.php`: Missing union/intersection count, array shape key count, and a more robust suspicious pattern check.
    *   `src/ConfigLoader.php`: Type strings from configuration files are not validated *before* being passed to `TypeResolver`.
    *   `src/User/InputHandler.php`: User-provided type strings (if any) are not validated *before* being passed to `TypeResolver`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Mechanism](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_mechanism.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Timeout Mechanism

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `TypeResolver` Calls:** Locate all direct calls to `TypeResolver::resolve()` and other potentially long-running methods within the library.
    2.  **Wrap with Timeout:** Enclose *each* call to `TypeResolver` methods within a timeout mechanism. This is about limiting the time `TypeResolver` itself is allowed to run:
        *   **`pcntl_alarm()` and Signal Handling (CLI):** Use `pcntl_alarm()` to set a timer *before* the `TypeResolver` call. Use `pcntl_signal()` to handle `SIGALRM`. If the timer expires, the handler throws an exception or sets a flag.
        *   **Custom Timer (Web Context/No `pcntl`):** Record the start time *before* the `TypeResolver` call. *After* the call, check if the elapsed time exceeds a threshold. If it does, log and handle the error.
    3.  **Error Handling:** Handle timeout exceptions/flags gracefully. Log the timeout, including the input type string. Return a safe default type or throw a specific exception to indicate the `TypeResolver` timeout.
    4.  **Configuration:** Make the timeout duration configurable.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Types:** (Severity: High) - Limits the time `TypeResolver` spends processing any single type, preventing it from blocking the application.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: High) - Prevents `TypeResolver` from consuming resources indefinitely due to a complex or malicious type.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces DoS impact by limiting `TypeResolver`'s execution time.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Prevents `TypeResolver` from being the direct cause of resource exhaustion.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All locations where `TypeResolver::resolve()` (and other relevant methods) are called directly. Examples: `src/TypeParser.php`, `src/ReflectionHelper.php`, `src/DocBlockAnalyzer.php`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Unit Testing with Edge Cases (Focus on `TypeResolver` Internals)](./mitigation_strategies/unit_testing_with_edge_cases__focus_on__typeresolver__internals_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Unit Testing with Edge Cases (Focus on `TypeResolver` Internals)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Edge Cases:** Analyze the PHP type system *and* `TypeResolver`'s *internal logic* and documentation to identify edge cases, ambiguities, and potential areas for unexpected behavior *within the library itself*.
    2.  **Create Test Cases:** Write unit tests that *directly* target these edge cases *within TypeResolver*.  These tests should:
        *   Provide specific, potentially problematic type strings *directly* to `TypeResolver`.
        *   Assert that `TypeResolver` resolves the types correctly *according to its intended behavior*.
        *   Assert that no internal errors or exceptions occur *within TypeResolver* during the resolution process.
    3.  **Automated Testing:** Integrate these tests into the project's automated test suite.
    4.  **Regression Testing:** If a bug is found *within TypeResolver*, add a test case to prevent recurrence.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Errors Due to Misinterpreted Types (Internal to TypeResolver):** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures `TypeResolver` itself behaves correctly, even with complex or ambiguous input.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior with Future PHP Versions (Affecting TypeResolver):** (Severity: Medium) - Provides early warning of compatibility issues if PHP changes affect `TypeResolver`'s internal logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Logic Errors:** Reduces the likelihood of `TypeResolver` itself producing incorrect results.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Increases the chances of detecting `TypeResolver` compatibility problems early.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic unit tests exist in `tests/TypeResolverTest.php`, but they are insufficient.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `tests/TypeResolverTest.php`: Needs many more test cases focusing on edge cases, recursive types, complex combinations, and interactions with PHP built-ins, specifically testing the *internal behavior* of `TypeResolver`.
