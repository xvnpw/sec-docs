## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities__high_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that target vulnerabilities within the code that parses type strings into internal representations.  The "parsing" process is inherently complex, making it a potential source of bugs.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Parsing vulnerabilities often lead to more severe consequences than logic errors, as they can bypass intended type checks and constraints.  The presence of a deserialization vulnerability makes this branch extremely dangerous.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Unsafe Deserialization (if applicable) [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_unsafe_deserialization__if_applicable___high_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the scenario where TypeResolver processes serialized data that is, directly or indirectly, influenced by an attacker.  PHP's `unserialize()` function is notoriously dangerous when used with untrusted input.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Unsafe deserialization is a well-known and highly exploitable vulnerability class.  It often leads directly to RCE.  The "if applicable" is crucial; this is only a threat if deserialization is happening *anywhere* in the TypeResolver process or in a way that TypeResolver's output influences.
*   **Mitigation (Highest Priority):**  *Absolutely ensure* that TypeResolver never processes untrusted serialized data.  This is the most critical mitigation.  If deserialization is unavoidable (which is highly unlikely and strongly discouraged for TypeResolver), use a safe deserialization library with strict whitelisting of allowed classes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Identify Gadget Chains (if applicable) [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_identify_gadget_chains__if_applicable___high_.md)

*   **Description:**  If unsafe deserialization is present, the attacker needs to find a "gadget chain."  This is a sequence of existing class methods within the application (or its dependencies) that, when executed in a specific order during deserialization, will perform malicious actions, ultimately leading to RCE.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Gadget chains are often readily available, especially in applications using common libraries or frameworks.  Tools exist to automate the discovery of gadget chains.
*   **Effort:** Medium to High. Requires knowledge of PHP object injection and available classes.
*   **Skill Level:** High. Requires a deep understanding of PHP internals and object-oriented programming.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  Detecting the *identification* of gadget chains is difficult.  Detection usually happens at the *exploitation* stage (2.1.2 or 2.1.3).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Inject Serialized Data (if applicable) [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_inject_serialized_data__if_applicable___high_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker must find a way to inject their crafted, malicious serialized data into the application in a location where it will be processed by TypeResolver (or influence TypeResolver's input). This is the most context-dependent step.
*   **Why High Risk:**  The *impact* is high (leading to RCE), but the *likelihood* depends entirely on the application's architecture.  If *any* pathway exists, even an indirect one, this becomes a critical vulnerability.  This is the most likely point of failure for the attacker, but if successful, the consequences are severe.
*   **Effort:** Highly variable, from Low to High. Depends entirely on the application's attack surface.  If TypeResolver is directly exposed to user input (which it shouldn't be), the effort is low.  If the attacker needs to exploit multiple vulnerabilities to reach a suitable injection point, the effort is high.
*   **Skill Level:** Highly variable, from Medium to High.  Depends on the complexity of the injection vector.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  Input validation and sanitization *should* prevent this, but if the injection is subtle or indirect, it might be missed.  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) might detect common serialized payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3 Execute Arbitrary Code (if applicable) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3_execute_arbitrary_code__if_applicable___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  If the attacker successfully injects a malicious serialized payload containing a valid gadget chain, this node represents the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Why Critical:**  This is the ultimate goal of many attackers.  RCE allows the attacker to take complete control of the server, steal data, install malware, and pivot to other systems.
*   **Effort:** Low (assuming 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 were successful).  The code execution is automatic once the payload is deserialized.
*   **Skill Level:**  Inherited from previous steps (High).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions *might* detect the malicious code execution, but sophisticated attackers can often bypass these defenses.  Log analysis is crucial for post-incident investigation.
