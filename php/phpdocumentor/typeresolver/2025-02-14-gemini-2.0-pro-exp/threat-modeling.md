## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Type Hint (Complex/Nested) - Resource Exhaustion](./threats/maliciously_crafted_type_hint__complexnested__-_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Type Hint (Complex/Nested) - Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a complex, deeply nested, or intentionally recursive type hint (e.g., `array<array<array<...>>>`, or a type hint that refers to itself, directly or indirectly, through clever use of generics or aliases). The attacker's goal is to cause excessive resource consumption (memory or CPU) during the type resolution process within `TypeResolver` itself. This exploits the parsing and type representation logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (memory or CPU). The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
        *   Potential for application crash due to stack overflow (if recursion is not properly handled *within TypeResolver*).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `TypeResolver::resolve()` (main entry point and primary target).
        *   `fqsenResolver::resolve()` (if FQSENs are part of the complex type hint).
        *   Internal parsing logic (specifically the recursive descent parser used to process nested structures).
        *   Type representation classes (especially those representing compound types like `ArrayType`, `CollectionType`, and potentially custom generic types). The creation and management of deeply nested type objects consume resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Length Limits:**  Strictly limit the maximum length of type hint strings *before* they are passed to `TypeResolver`. This is the most effective preventative measure.
        *   **Recursion Depth Limits:** Ideally, `TypeResolver` itself should have built-in limits on recursion depth to prevent stack overflows.  If not present, consider contributing this improvement to the library.  This is a *library-level* mitigation.
        *   **Memory and Time Limits (PHP Configuration):**  Enforce strict memory and execution time limits for PHP processes.  This is a system-level mitigation, but it helps contain the damage.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Fuzz test `TypeResolver` *directly* with a variety of complex and nested type hints to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in its parsing logic. This is a proactive testing strategy.

## Threat: [Fuzzing Target Leading to Unexpected Behavior or Crash (Directly within TypeResolver)](./threats/fuzzing_target_leading_to_unexpected_behavior_or_crash__directly_within_typeresolver_.md)

* **Threat:** Fuzzing Target Leading to Unexpected Behavior or Crash (Directly within TypeResolver)

    * **Description:** An attacker submits a large number of randomly generated, malformed, or edge-case type hint strings directly to `TypeResolver`'s API. The goal is to trigger crashes, unexpected exceptions, or undefined behavior *within the TypeResolver library itself*, due to flaws in its parsing or type handling logic. This is a direct attack on the library's robustness.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to crashes or unhandled exceptions within `TypeResolver`.
        *   Discovery of previously unknown vulnerabilities in `TypeResolver`'s parsing or type handling.
        *   Potentially, unexpected logic errors *if* the fuzzer finds a way to bypass internal checks and cause `TypeResolver` to return an incorrect, but seemingly valid, type representation.
    * **Affected Component:**
        *   `TypeResolver::resolve()` (and all its sub-components, including parsing and type creation).
        *   The entire parsing logic (handling of various type constructs, keywords, and syntax).
        *   All type representation classes (handling of edge cases and invalid input during object creation).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Proactively fuzz test `TypeResolver` *itself* (as a library) as part of its development and maintenance process. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Ensure that `TypeResolver` internally handles unexpected input gracefully and does not crash or throw unexpected exceptions. This requires careful coding and testing *within the library*.
        *   **Input Validation (at the TypeResolver API level):** While the primary responsibility is on the *caller* of `TypeResolver`, the library itself could potentially benefit from some basic input validation (e.g., sanity checks on string length) at its API entry point (`resolve()`). This is a defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `TypeResolver` library updated to benefit from any bug fixes or security improvements discovered through fuzzing or other testing by the maintainers.
