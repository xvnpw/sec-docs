# Attack Surface Analysis for phpdocumentor/typeresolver

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Type Strings](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_type_strings.md)

*Description:* Attackers can craft intentionally complex or deeply nested type strings to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during parsing, leading to a denial-of-service.
*How TypeResolver Contributes:* The library's core function is parsing these type strings, making it the *direct* target of this attack. The recursive nature of the parsing algorithm is the key vulnerability. TypeResolver *is* the component being attacked.
*Example:* `array<array<array<array<array<array<array<int>>>>>>>>` (repeated many times), or a union type with thousands of elements: `int|string|float|...` (extremely long).
*Impact:* Application unavailability, resource exhaustion, potential server crash.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (Easy to trigger, significant impact, directly targets TypeResolver).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict limits on the length and complexity of type strings accepted by the application. Reject overly long or deeply nested strings *before* passing them to TypeResolver. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Set time and memory limits for the TypeResolver process. Use timeouts to prevent indefinite processing. Consider using resource limits at the PHP level (e.g., `memory_limit`, `max_execution_time`).
    *   **Complexity Limits:** Specifically limit the nesting depth of generic types (e.g., arrays, collections) and the number of elements in union/intersection types within the TypeResolver configuration or wrapper code.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** If type resolution is triggered by user input, implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from flooding the system with requests.
