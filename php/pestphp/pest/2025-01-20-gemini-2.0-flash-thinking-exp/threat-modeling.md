# Threat Model Analysis for pestphp/pest

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Execution](./threats/malicious_test_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could introduce malicious code within a Pest test. This code, executed by the Pest test runner, could perform actions beyond testing, like accessing environment variables or making network requests. The vulnerability lies in Pest's execution of arbitrary code within test files.

**Impact:** Data breaches, system compromise, denial of service.

**Affected Pest Component:** Test files (`.php` files in the `tests` directory), the Pest test runner.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict code review processes for all test code changes.
* Enforce coding standards and security best practices for test development.
* Utilize static analysis tools on test code.
* Run tests in isolated environments with minimal necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Test Data or Fixtures](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_test_data_or_fixtures.md)

**Description:** Developers might include sensitive information in test data, fixtures, or seeders used by Pest tests. This data, accessible through Pest's data loading mechanisms, could be exposed if an attacker gains access to the codebase or test reports.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external services, compromise of user accounts.

**Affected Pest Component:** Test files, data providers, factory definitions, seeders.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using real credentials or sensitive data in tests.
* Utilize dedicated testing credentials and environments.
* Implement mechanisms to sanitize or anonymize test data.
* Store sensitive test data securely and avoid committing it directly to version control.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Pest or its Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_pest_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Pest relies on PHP packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited if not updated. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities during Pest's execution or through other means.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service.

**Affected Pest Component:** `composer.json` (dependency management), the Pest framework itself.

**Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability (listing as High/Critical as requested).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Pest and all its dependencies using `composer update`.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools.
* Monitor security advisories for Pest and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Abuse of Test Environment Privileges](./threats/abuse_of_test_environment_privileges.md)

**Description:** Pest tests often run with elevated privileges. A malicious test, or an attacker exploiting a vulnerability in Pest itself, could abuse these privileges to perform unauthorized actions on the test environment.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modifications to the application or its environment, denial of service.

**Affected Pest Component:** The Pest test runner, the environment in which tests are executed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Minimize the privileges granted to the test environment.
* Implement strict access controls for the test environment.
* Monitor test execution for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Test Results in CI/CD Pipelines](./threats/manipulation_of_test_results_in_cicd_pipelines.md)

**Description:** If the process of running Pest tests and reporting results in a CI/CD pipeline is not secured, an attacker might manipulate test results. This could involve tampering with Pest's execution or reporting to bypass security checks.

**Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable code, bypassing security gates.

**Affected Pest Component:** The Pest test runner integration with the CI/CD pipeline, reporting mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure and access controls.
* Implement integrity checks for test results and reports.
* Ensure that the process of running tests and reporting results is auditable and tamper-proof.
