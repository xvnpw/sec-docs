## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Test Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_test_code.md)

**Goal:** Introduce and execute malicious code within the testing framework.

**Description:** Attackers can leverage the flexibility of Pest to inject and execute arbitrary code during test runs. This can be achieved by directly modifying test files or by exploiting how Pest handles dynamic code execution.

**Mechanisms:**
*   **Inject Malicious Code into Tests (Critical Node):**
    *   Leverage Dynamic Code Execution Features: Pest allows for dynamic code execution in certain scenarios. Attackers could inject malicious PHP code into strings that are later evaluated, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   Exploit Unsafe Data Handling in Tests: If tests process external data without proper sanitization, attackers could inject malicious payloads that are then used in a vulnerable manner within the application's context during testing.
    *   Introduce Backdoors in Test Files: Attackers with access to the codebase could directly insert backdoor code into test files. This code would be executed whenever the tests are run, potentially granting persistent access.
*   **Interfere with Test Dependencies (Critical Node):** Attackers could introduce malicious dependencies or modify existing ones used by the tests. When Pest runs the tests, these compromised dependencies could execute malicious code.

**Impact:** Full control over the server, data breaches, denial of service.

**Mitigation:**
*   Strict Code Reviews: Thoroughly review all test code for potential vulnerabilities and malicious insertions.
*   Secure Code Practices in Tests: Treat test code with the same security considerations as production code. Avoid dynamic code execution where possible. Sanitize inputs used in tests.
*   Integrity Checks: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of test files and Pest's core files.
*   Dependency Management: Use a dependency management tool (like Composer) and regularly update dependencies. Implement security scanning for dependencies.
*   Restrict Access: Limit access to the codebase and the environment where tests are executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Goal:** Manipulate Pest's configuration to execute malicious code or gain access to sensitive information.

**Description:** Pest relies on configuration files (e.g., `pest.php`) and environment variables. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in how Pest handles these configurations.

**Mechanisms:**
*   **Configuration Poisoning (Critical Node):**
    *   Modify `pest.php` or other configuration files: If an attacker gains write access to the configuration files, they can inject malicious code directly into PHP arrays or paths that are later processed by Pest.
    *   Exploit Environment Variable Handling: Pest might use environment variables for configuration. Attackers could set malicious environment variables that are then used by Pest in a vulnerable way, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure.

**Impact:** Code execution, information disclosure, privilege escalation.

**Mitigation:**
*   Restrict File System Permissions: Ensure that configuration files are not writable by unauthorized users.
*   Secure Environment Variable Management: Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables if possible. Use secure secret management solutions.
*   Input Validation: If Pest processes configuration values from external sources, ensure proper validation and sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Pest](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_pest.md)

**Goal:** Leverage vulnerabilities in the packages that Pest depends on.

**Description:** Pest relies on other PHP packages. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them to compromise the application.

**Mechanisms:**
*   **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Pest's Dependencies (Critical Node):** Attackers can identify known vulnerabilities in Pest's dependencies and exploit them if the dependencies are not updated.

**Impact:** Varies (Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution).

**Mitigation:**
*   Regular Dependency Updates: Keep Pest and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Dependency Scanning: Use tools like `composer audit` or dedicated security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Pin Dependencies: Consider pinning dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
