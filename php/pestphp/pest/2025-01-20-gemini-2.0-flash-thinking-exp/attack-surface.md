# Attack Surface Analysis for pestphp/pest

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of malicious or flawed test code being introduced into the test suite, either intentionally or unintentionally.
    *   **How Pest Contributes:** Pest executes the code within the test files. If these files are compromised or contain malicious logic, Pest will execute that code during the test run.
    *   **Example:** A developer inadvertently includes a test that deletes all files in a temporary directory, or an attacker compromises a developer's machine and injects a test that exfiltrates database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, unauthorized access, system compromise, denial of service during testing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for test code, just like application code.
        *   Use version control for test files and track changes.
        *   Secure development environments to prevent unauthorized modification of test files.
        *   Employ static analysis tools on test code to identify potential issues.
        *   Run tests in isolated environments (e.g., containers) to limit the impact of malicious code.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Test Data Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_test_data_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of sensitive data used in tests being exposed or mishandled.
    *   **How Pest Contributes:** Pest facilitates the setup and use of test data. If this data includes sensitive information and is not managed securely, Pest becomes the execution engine for potential exposure.
    *   **Example:** Test data includes real user passwords or API keys that are stored in plain text within test files or easily accessible fixtures. These are then exposed if the repository is compromised or through error messages.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive personal information, API keys, or other confidential data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using real or sensitive data in tests whenever possible.
        *   Use anonymized or synthetic data for testing.
        *   If sensitive data is necessary, store it securely (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions) and avoid hardcoding it in test files.
        *   Ensure test data is not committed to version control systems unnecessarily.
        *   Sanitize or redact sensitive information from test outputs and logs.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities in `pest.php`](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities_in__pest_php_.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of misconfigurations or insecure storage of sensitive information within Pest's configuration file (`pest.php`).
    *   **How Pest Contributes:** Pest relies on `pest.php` for configuration. If this file contains sensitive information or insecure settings, it becomes a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:**  Database credentials or API keys are directly embedded within the `pest.php` file and are accidentally committed to a public repository.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to databases or external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive configuration values (like database credentials) outside of the `pest.php` file, preferably using environment variables.
        *   Restrict file system permissions on `pest.php` and related configuration files to the necessary users.
        *   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive configuration files if necessary.
