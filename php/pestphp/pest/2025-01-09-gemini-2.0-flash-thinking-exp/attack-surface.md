# Attack Surface Analysis for pestphp/pest

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Test Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_test_files.md)

**Description:** Developers might unknowingly or maliciously introduce code within test files that, when executed by Pest, could interact with the application or the testing environment in unintended ways.

**How Pest Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Pest's core function is to execute PHP code within the test files. This direct execution path is the entry point for malicious code.

**Example:** A developer adds a test case that, upon execution by Pest, reads sensitive environment variables and sends them to an external server.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to resources, modification of application state, denial of service on the testing environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement mandatory code reviews for all test files.
* Enforce strict access controls to the codebase, limiting who can commit changes.
* Utilize static analysis tools on test files to detect potentially malicious code patterns.
* Employ CI/CD pipelines with security scanning steps that analyze test code.
* Educate developers on secure coding practices for testing.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Test Cases](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_test_cases.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials, passwords) directly within test cases for convenience or during debugging.

**How Pest Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Pest executes these test files, making the sensitive information present in the code accessible during test runs. The storage of these files within the project directory makes them potential targets.

**Example:** A test case directly uses a production API key to interact with an external service for testing purposes, and this key is committed to the repository.

**Impact:** Compromise of external services, unauthorized access to application data, potential financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in test files.
* Utilize environment variables or dedicated configuration files for sensitive data in tests.
* Implement secret management solutions to securely handle credentials in testing.
* Regularly scan the codebase (including test files) for exposed secrets.
* Ensure proper access controls on the repository to limit who can view test files.
