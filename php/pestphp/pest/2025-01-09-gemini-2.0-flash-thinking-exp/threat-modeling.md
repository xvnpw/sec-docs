# Threat Model Analysis for pestphp/pest

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Execution](./threats/malicious_test_code_execution.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Test Code Execution

**Description:** An attacker introduces malicious PHP code within a Pest test file. When these tests are executed *by Pest*, the malicious code runs with the same privileges as the test runner, potentially interacting directly with the application or its environment. This directly leverages Pest's core function of executing test code.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, or introduction of backdoors into the application.

**Affected Pest Component:** Test Execution Engine (the core functionality of Pest that runs the test code).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict code review processes for all test files.
*   Utilize static analysis tools on test code to detect potentially malicious or vulnerable patterns.
*   Employ strong access controls and authentication for code repositories and development environments.
*   Regularly scan dependencies of test files for known vulnerabilities using tools like `composer audit`.
*   Consider running tests in isolated environments with limited access to sensitive resources.
*   Implement a "principle of least privilege" approach for test execution environments.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Test Output](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_test_output.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Test Output

**Description:** Developers inadvertently include sensitive information within test assertions, descriptions, or data providers. When tests are executed *by Pest*, and especially when they fail or are run with verbose output, this information can be exposed in logs, CI/CD pipelines, or shared test reports generated by Pest.

**Impact:** Exposure of credentials leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or privacy violations.

**Affected Pest Component:** Test Reporting and Output (how Pest displays test results and any debugging information).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly review test output and logs for sensitive information.
*   Implement mechanisms to redact sensitive data from test output.
*   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in test files. Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management for test data.
*   Educate developers on the importance of avoiding sensitive data in test output and how to handle it securely.
*   Ensure that test reports and logs generated by Pest are stored securely and access is restricted.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Application State Through Tests](./threats/manipulation_of_application_state_through_tests.md)

**Threat:** Manipulation of Application State Through Tests

**Description:** Poorly designed or malicious tests, when executed *by Pest*, could intentionally or unintentionally alter the application's state (database records, file system, etc.) in a way that compromises its security or functionality. An attacker might exploit Pest's ability to interact with the application to leave it in a vulnerable state.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state leading to security vulnerabilities, or denial of service.

**Affected Pest Component:** Test Execution and Interaction with Application (how Pest interacts with the application under test during execution).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Design tests to be idempotent and leave the application in a known, consistent state after execution.
*   Utilize database transactions or other rollback mechanisms within tests to prevent persistent state changes.
*   Implement proper setup and teardown routines in tests to ensure a clean environment before and after each test.
*   Enforce code review for tests that modify application state.
