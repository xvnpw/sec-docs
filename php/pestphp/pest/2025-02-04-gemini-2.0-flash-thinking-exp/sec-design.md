# BUSINESS POSTURE

PestPHP is a testing framework for PHP. Its primary business goal is to provide a more enjoyable and efficient testing experience for PHP developers. By offering a more expressive and user-friendly syntax compared to traditional PHPUnit, PestPHP aims to increase developer productivity, encourage more comprehensive testing, and ultimately contribute to higher quality PHP applications.

Business Priorities:
- Developer Experience:  The framework must be easy to learn, use, and integrate into existing PHP projects.
- Stability and Reliability: The framework needs to be stable and reliable to gain developer trust and adoption.
- Performance:  Testing should be fast and efficient to minimize development feedback loops.
- Community Growth:  A strong and active community is crucial for the long-term success and evolution of the framework.

Business Risks:
- Adoption Risk: If developers do not find PestPHP significantly better than existing solutions, adoption may be limited, hindering the project's goals.
- Security Vulnerabilities in Framework:  If security vulnerabilities are discovered in PestPHP itself, it could damage the framework's reputation and discourage adoption. While PestPHP is not directly involved in application security, vulnerabilities could lead to supply chain attacks or be exploited in development environments.
- Compatibility Issues:  Incompatibility with certain PHP versions, extensions, or popular libraries could limit the framework's usability and adoption.
- Lack of Community Support:  If the community doesn't grow and actively contribute, the framework's development and maintenance could stagnate.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Reliance on underlying PHP runtime security. PestPHP is a PHP library and depends on the security of the PHP environment it runs in. (Implemented by: PHP runtime environment)
- security control: Dependency management via Composer. PestPHP uses Composer for dependency management, leveraging Composer's security features for package integrity. (Implemented by: Composer and Packagist)
- security control: Open Source and Community Review. As an open-source project, the PestPHP codebase is publicly accessible for review, potentially leading to community-driven identification of security issues. (Implemented by: GitHub and Open Source Community)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies. PestPHP relies on third-party packages, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect PestPHP users.
- accepted risk: Misuse of framework by developers. Developers might use PestPHP in insecure ways or write insecure tests, although this is not a direct vulnerability in PestPHP itself.
- accepted risk:  Development environment security. Security of development environments where PestPHP is used is assumed to be the responsibility of the developers and organizations using it.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Dependency Scanning. Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in PestPHP's dependencies. (To be implemented in: CI/CD pipeline)
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the PestPHP codebase for potential security vulnerabilities. (To be implemented in: CI/CD pipeline)
- security control: Secure Release Process. Establish a secure release process that includes code review, security testing, and signed releases to ensure the integrity of PestPHP distributions. (To be implemented in: Release management process)

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a testing framework. PestPHP itself does not handle user authentication. However, tested applications might, and PestPHP should be able to test authentication mechanisms securely.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a testing framework. PestPHP does not enforce authorization. However, tested applications will, and PestPHP should be able to test authorization logic.
- Input Validation: Relevant for PestPHP in terms of handling test inputs and configuration. The framework should avoid vulnerabilities related to processing malicious test data or configuration.
- Cryptography: Potentially relevant if PestPHP needs to handle or report on cryptographic operations in tested applications. PestPHP itself should not introduce cryptographic vulnerabilities. If PestPHP provides features related to testing cryptographic functionality, these features should be implemented securely.

## DEPLOYMENT

PestPHP is primarily a development-time tool and is not "deployed" in the traditional sense of a web application. However, it is used in various environments, including local development environments and CI/CD pipelines.  A typical deployment scenario is its integration into a developer's local machine and a CI/CD pipeline. We will focus on the CI/CD pipeline deployment for this document as it represents a more structured and potentially security-sensitive environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Process:
- Ensuring Software Quality: PestPHP directly supports the critical business process of ensuring software quality through testing. High-quality software reduces bugs, improves user satisfaction, and minimizes security vulnerabilities in applications built using PHP.

Data to Protect:
- Test Code: The PestPHP test code itself is valuable intellectual property and should be protected from unauthorized access and modification. Sensitivity: Medium.
- Application Code Under Test: The application code being tested by PestPHP is the primary asset. Its sensitivity depends on the nature of the application. For applications handling sensitive user data or critical business logic, the application code is highly sensitive. Sensitivity: High to Very High (depending on the application).
- Test Data: Test data used in PestPHP tests might contain sensitive information, especially in integration or end-to-end tests. The sensitivity of test data is directly related to the sensitivity of the data handled by the application being tested. Sensitivity: Low to Very High (depending on the test data).
- Test Reports: Test reports can contain information about the application's behavior and potential vulnerabilities. While less sensitive than the code itself, they should still be protected from unauthorized disclosure. Sensitivity: Low to Medium.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the primary use case for this design document? Is it for internal PestPHP development team security review, or for users of PestPHP to understand its security posture, or for a broader security audit?
- What is the risk appetite of the organization or project using PestPHP? Is it a startup with a higher risk tolerance or a large enterprise with strict security requirements?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the applications tested with PestPHP must adhere to? This could influence the security requirements for the testing framework and its usage.
- What level of security expertise is expected from the developers using PestPHP? Should the framework be designed to be secure by default and guide developers towards secure testing practices?

Assumptions:
- PestPHP is primarily used for functional and unit testing of PHP applications, not for security testing itself (like penetration testing or vulnerability scanning).
- The security of the applications tested with PestPHP is the ultimate responsibility of the developers and organizations building those applications. PestPHP aims to be a secure and reliable tool that aids in building quality software, but it is not a security solution in itself.
- PestPHP is intended to be used in development and CI/CD environments, not in production environments. Security concerns are primarily focused on protecting development assets, ensuring the integrity of the framework, and preventing the introduction of vulnerabilities through the testing process.
- The target audience for PestPHP is PHP developers with varying levels of security awareness. The framework should strive to be user-friendly and not impose unnecessary security burdens on developers while still promoting secure practices.
