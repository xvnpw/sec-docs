# Threat Model Analysis for pestphp/pest

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Pest or its Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_pest_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Pest relies on PHPUnit and other PHP packages. Critical or high severity vulnerabilities discovered in Pest's core code, PHPUnit, or any of its direct dependencies (like Symfony components used internally by Pest or PHPUnit) could be exploited by attackers. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise the development or test environment where Pest is used. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the test environment, information disclosure, or denial of service. Exploitation could occur if the vulnerable Pest version or dependency is used in a publicly accessible test server or if an attacker gains access to the development environment.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of development/test environment leading to arbitrary code execution, sensitive information disclosure (including source code, database credentials, API keys used in tests), potential supply chain attacks if malicious code is injected through compromised dependencies, and significant disruption of development and testing processes.
*   **Pest Component Affected:** Pest Core, Dependencies (PHPUnit, Symfony components, etc.), Composer integration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability and exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately update Pest and all its dependencies:**  Promptly apply security patches and upgrade to the latest versions of Pest and its dependencies, especially PHPUnit, as soon as security updates are released.
    *   **Implement Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools (integrated into CI/CD pipelines or development workflows) to continuously monitor Pest and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Isolate Development and Test Environments:**  Strictly isolate development and test environments from production networks and limit external access. Implement strong network security controls and access restrictions to minimize the attack surface of these environments.
    *   **Secure Dependency Management:** Use Composer securely and verify package integrity using checksums or signatures. Consider using private package repositories to control and audit dependencies.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the development and test infrastructure, including Pest and its dependencies, to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities proactively.
