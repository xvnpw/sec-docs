## Attack Tree Path: [**1. [CRITICAL NODE] Attack Goal: Achieve Remote Code Execution or Influence Application via PestPHP [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__attack_goal_achieve_remote_code_execution_or_influence_application_via_pestphp__c_7ceb89f3.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate objective. Success here means the attacker has gained significant control over the application or its testing environment through PestPHP related vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the application or development/testing infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [**2. [CRITICAL NODE] 1. Exploit Code Execution during Test Execution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__1__exploit_code_execution_during_test_execution__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  This is the primary high-risk path.  Pest executes PHP code during tests, making it a direct avenue for code injection and execution.
* **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE).
* **Likelihood:** High - Due to the nature of code execution in testing and potential vulnerabilities in related areas.
* **Mitigation Focus:**  Prioritize preventing any form of malicious code injection or execution during Pest test runs.

## Attack Tree Path: [**3. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.3. Compromised Development Environment (Pre-existing Access) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__1_1_3__compromised_development_environment__pre-existing_access___critical_node___dc061c91.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Attacker gains access to the development environment through methods like:
    * Compromised developer accounts (weak passwords, phishing).
    * Insider threats (malicious or negligent employees).
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in development environment infrastructure.
* **Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise of the development environment, allowing modification of test files and potentially application code.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Development environments often have weaker security controls than production.
* **Effort:** Medium - Depends on the security posture of the development environment, could range from simple password guessing to more sophisticated social engineering or exploits.
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** High - Requires robust logging and anomaly detection within the development environment, as malicious activity can blend with normal developer actions.
* **Mitigation Focus:**
    * Secure access controls (Multi-Factor Authentication, Principle of Least Privilege).
    * Regular security audits of development environment infrastructure.
    * Security awareness training for developers.
    * Strong password policies and account management.

## Attack Tree Path: [**4. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in PestPHP Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node__1_2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pestphp_dependencies__critical_node___high-risk_p_3a46d81a.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in PestPHP's dependencies, such as:
    * PHPUnit
    * Symfony components
    * Other libraries used by Pest or the application's test suite.
* **Impact:** High-Critical - Can lead to Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or other forms of compromise, depending on the specific vulnerability.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Dependencies frequently have vulnerabilities, and if not managed properly, outdated vulnerable versions can persist.
* **Effort:** Low - Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available and easy to use.
* **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate - Utilizing existing exploits requires relatively low skill.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium - Vulnerability scanners and security monitoring can detect exploitation attempts if signatures are available.
* **Mitigation Focus:**
    * Regular dependency updates.
    * Automated vulnerability scanning (e.g., `composer audit`).
    * Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management to track dependencies.
    * Dependency pinning to control versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [**5. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.2.1. Known Vulnerabilities in Pest Core Dependencies (e.g., PHPUnit, Symfony Components) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node__1_2_1__known_vulnerabilities_in_pest_core_dependencies__e_g___phpunit__symfony_co_e0369790.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specifically targeting known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in direct dependencies of PestPHP.
* **Impact:** High-Critical - Same as general dependency vulnerabilities (RCE, DoS, etc.).
* **Likelihood:** Medium -  These vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched, but applications might lag in updating.
* **Effort:** Low - Exploits are often readily available.
* **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium.
* **Mitigation Focus:**  Same as general dependency vulnerabilities (regular updates, vulnerability scanning, SBOM).

## Attack Tree Path: [**6. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.2.3. Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/6___critical_node__1_2_3__transitive_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in *transitive* dependencies - dependencies of Pest's direct dependencies. These are often overlooked in security assessments.
* **Impact:** High-Critical - Same as direct dependency vulnerabilities.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Transitive dependencies are often less visible and might not be updated as diligently.
* **Effort:** Low-Medium - Vulnerability scanners can identify transitive vulnerabilities.
* **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate (using scanners).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires tools that can analyze the full dependency tree.
* **Mitigation Focus:**
    * Dependency auditing tools that analyze transitive dependencies.
    * SBOM management for full dependency visibility.
    * Consider strategies to flatten dependency structures where feasible to simplify management.

## Attack Tree Path: [**7. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.3. Exploit Pest Configuration Misconfigurations [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/7___critical_node__1_3__exploit_pest_configuration_misconfigurations__critical_node___high-risk_path_582741b7.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting insecure configurations in PestPHP's `pest.php` file or related settings, such as:
    * Unsafe include paths that could lead to Local File Inclusion (LFI).
    * Overly permissive access to sensitive resources during test execution.
* **Impact:** Medium-Critical - Depending on the misconfiguration, could lead to information disclosure, unauthorized access, or even Remote Code Execution in some scenarios.
* **Likelihood:** Low - Default Pest configuration is generally secure, but custom configurations or modifications can introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Effort:** Low - Simple configuration errors are easy to make.
* **Skill Level:** Beginner.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low-Medium - Configuration reviews and static analysis can detect some misconfigurations.
* **Mitigation Focus:**
    * Secure configuration practices.
    * Principle of Least Privilege for file access and test execution scope.
    * Regular review of Pest configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [**8. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.3.2. Overly Permissive Test Suite Execution Scope (Access to Sensitive Resources) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/8___critical_node__1_3_2__overly_permissive_test_suite_execution_scope__access_to_sensitive_resource_c322bbf1.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Tests are configured or allowed to access sensitive resources (databases, APIs, file systems) in a production-like environment without proper isolation. A compromised test could then interact with and potentially compromise these real resources.
* **Impact:** Medium-High - Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, potential disruption of services.
* **Likelihood:** Medium - Common in development if test environments are not properly isolated and tests interact with live systems.
* **Effort:** Low - Exploiting existing test access is relatively easy if the environment is misconfigured.
* **Skill Level:** Beginner-Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring test environment access and activity, and understanding the intended scope of tests.
* **Mitigation Focus:**
    * Isolate test environments (use dedicated test databases, mock external services).
    * Principle of Least Privilege for test execution context - limit permissions.
    * Use mocking and stubbing extensively to avoid real interactions with external systems during testing.
