## Mitigation Strategy: [Secrets Management in Tests - Utilize Environment Variables (Pest Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/secrets_management_in_tests_-_utilize_environment_variables__pest_focused_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Environment Variables for Secrets in Pest Tests
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Secrets in Pest Tests:** Review your Pest test suite and pinpoint all instances where sensitive information (API keys, database passwords, service credentials, etc.) is being used directly within your test files.
        2.  **Leverage Pest's Environment Access:** Pest provides easy access to environment variables within your tests.  Instead of hardcoding secrets, use PHP functions like `getenv('VARIABLE_NAME')` or access `$_ENV` or `$_SERVER` superglobals within your Pest test cases to retrieve secrets.
        3.  **Configure Test Environments for Pest:** Ensure your test environments (local development, CI/CD pipelines) are configured to set these environment variables *before* Pest tests are executed. Pest will then be able to access these variables during test runs. For local development, you might use `.env` files (with caution - ensure they are not committed to version control) or shell environment variables. For CI/CD, configure environment variables within your pipeline settings, ensuring they are available when Pest tests are executed.
        4.  **Secure Storage of Variables for Pest:** Store the actual secret values securely in your environment configuration.  Avoid committing `.env` files containing secrets to version control. Use secure secret management features provided by your CI/CD platform or operating system to manage secrets used by Pest tests in automated environments.
        5.  **Document Pest Environment Setup:** Clearly document how to set up environment variables for local Pest test execution and for different testing environments used by Pest, ensuring all developers and the CI/CD pipeline are correctly configured to run Pest tests with necessary secrets.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Hardcoded Secrets in Pest Test Files in Version Control (High Severity):**  Accidental exposure of sensitive credentials by embedding them directly within Pest test files and committing them to code repositories. This is a high severity threat because Pest test files are code and are subject to version control, making hardcoded secrets easily discoverable if the repository is compromised or publicly accessible.
        *   **Secrets Leaked in Pest Test Logs (Medium Severity):** If secrets are hardcoded in Pest tests and are echoed or logged during test execution (e.g., in debug output from Pest tests), they could be inadvertently exposed in test logs generated by Pest, which might be less protected than code repositories.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Hardcoded Secrets in Pest Test Files in Version Control (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of accidental secret exposure in version control specifically within Pest test code.
        *   **Secrets Leaked in Pest Test Logs (Medium Impact):** Reduces the chance of secrets appearing in logs generated by Pest test runs if logging practices are also reviewed and adjusted to avoid printing sensitive environment variables accessed by Pest tests.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Database credentials for testing are loaded from environment variables in the CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) when Pest tests are executed in CI.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** API keys used in some integration Pest tests are still hardcoded in test files (`tests/Feature/ApiTests.php`). Local development environment setup for environment variables to be used by Pest tests is not consistently documented, leading to inconsistencies among developer setups when running Pest tests locally. This means developers might resort to hardcoding secrets for local Pest test runs.
