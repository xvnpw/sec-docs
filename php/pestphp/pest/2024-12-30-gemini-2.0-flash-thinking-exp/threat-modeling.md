### High and Critical Pest-Specific Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Pest testing framework:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Test Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code within a Pest test file. This code is executed by the Pest engine during test runs, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or unauthorized access within the test environment. The malicious code directly leverages Pest's execution capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of sensitive data within the test environment.
        *   Corruption of test data, leading to unreliable test results.
        *   Potential for lateral movement to other systems if the test environment has broad network access.
        *   Delay or disruption of software releases due to compromised testing.
    *   **Affected Pest Component:** Test Files (PHP files containing Pest tests), Test Execution Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all test code changes.
        *   Enforce strong access controls and permissions on test code repositories and the test environment.
        *   Use a separate, isolated environment for testing, minimizing access to production systems and data.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to scan test code for potential vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.
        *   Regularly audit test code for suspicious or unnecessary functionality.

*   **Threat:** Code Injection via Dynamic Test Generation
    *   **Description:** If Pest's `DataProvider` or custom logic is used to dynamically generate tests based on external input, an attacker could inject malicious code into this input. When Pest generates and executes tests, the injected code will be executed by the Pest engine.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote code execution within the testing environment, directly through Pest's execution.
        *   Data exfiltration or modification orchestrated by the injected code during test execution.
        *   Compromise of the testing infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Pest Component:** `DataProvider` functionality, any custom logic for dynamic test generation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all external input used for dynamic test generation within Pest.
        *   Avoid using untrusted sources for dynamic test data used by Pest.
        *   Implement strict input validation and escaping techniques before passing data to Pest's dynamic test generation features.
        *   Consider alternative approaches to dynamic test generation that minimize the risk of code injection within the Pest context.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Pest Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Pest relies on other PHP packages managed by Composer. Critical vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited during Pest's operation, potentially leading to remote code execution or other severe impacts within the testing environment where Pest is running.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote code execution within the testing environment.
        *   Information disclosure by exploiting vulnerable dependencies used by Pest.
        *   Denial of service against the testing infrastructure if a vulnerable dependency is exploited.
    *   **Affected Pest Component:** Dependency management (Composer).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Pest and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions using Composer.
        *   Use `composer audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in Pest's dependencies.
        *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to continuously monitor Pest's dependencies for vulnerabilities.
