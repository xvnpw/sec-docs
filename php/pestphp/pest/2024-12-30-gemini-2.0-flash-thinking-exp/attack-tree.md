Okay, here's the updated attack tree focusing on High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes, without using markdown tables:

**Threat Model: Compromising Application via Pest - High-Risk Sub-tree**

**Root Goal:** Compromise Application via Pest

**High-Risk Sub-tree:**

```
Compromise Application via Pest
└── OR
    └── **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Inject Malicious Code via Pest Test Files **[CRITICAL NODE: Gain Write Access to Test Files]**
        ├── AND
        │   ├── **[CRITICAL NODE: Gain Write Access to Test Files]**
        │   ├── **[CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Test Code]**
        │   └── **[CRITICAL NODE: Trigger Malicious Code Execution]**
```

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code via Pest Test Files**

*   This path is considered high-risk due to the combination of high likelihood and critical impact at several stages. Successfully executing this path leads to the potential for full application compromise.

**Critical Node: Gain Write Access to Test Files**

*   **Description:** This node represents the attacker successfully gaining the ability to modify existing test files or create new ones within the project.
*   **Why it's Critical:**
    *   It's a prerequisite for injecting malicious test code.
    *   Compromising this node opens the door for persistent attacks through the test suite.
    *   Multiple attack vectors can lead to this node being compromised (developer machine compromise, VCS exploitation, supply chain attacks).
*   **Associated Attack Steps (that lead to this critical node):**
    *   Compromise Developer Machine
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Exploit VCS Vulnerability (e.g., Git)
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Medium to High
        *   Skill Level: Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   Supply Chain Attack (Compromised Dependency used in testing)
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: Significant
        *   Effort: High
        *   Skill Level: Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult

**Critical Node: Inject Malicious Test Code**

*   **Description:** Once write access to test files is achieved, this node represents the attacker successfully writing malicious code within a Pest test file. This code is designed to execute arbitrary application code or system commands.
*   **Why it's Critical:**
    *   This is the point where the attacker introduces their malicious payload into the testing framework.
    *   The impact is critical as it allows for arbitrary code execution within the application's context during testing.
*   **Associated Attack Step:**
    *   Write tests that execute arbitrary application code or system commands
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult

**Critical Node: Trigger Malicious Code Execution**

*   **Description:** This node represents the execution of the infected test suite, either manually by a developer or automatically through a CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Why it's Critical:**
    *   This is the point where the injected malicious code is actually executed, leading to the intended compromise.
    *   The likelihood is very high as running tests is a standard part of the development process.
    *   The impact is critical as it results in the execution of malicious code.
*   **Associated Attack Step:**
    *   Run the infected test suite (manually or via CI/CD)
        *   Likelihood: Very High
        *   Impact: Critical
        *   Effort: Very Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
