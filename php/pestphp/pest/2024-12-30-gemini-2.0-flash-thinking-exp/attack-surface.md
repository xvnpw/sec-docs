*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Test Code Execution**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code within the testing environment by injecting or modifying test files.
    *   **How Pest Contributes:** Pest is designed to execute PHP files located in designated test directories. If these directories are writable or if the process of creating/modifying test files is insecure, malicious code can be introduced and executed by Pest.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine and modifies an existing test file to include code that reads sensitive environment variables and sends them to an external server. When Pest runs the tests, this malicious code is executed.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the testing environment, potential access to sensitive data, modification of application code, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on the test directories and configuration files.
        *   Use version control for test files and review changes carefully.
        *   Ensure the development environment is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
        *   Consider using a dedicated, isolated environment for running tests.

*   **Attack Surface: Dependency Vulnerabilities in Test Dependencies**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in third-party libraries required by Pest or the test suite itself (e.g., mocking libraries, assertion libraries).
    *   **How Pest Contributes:** Pest relies on Composer for managing dependencies. If the `composer.json` file includes vulnerable dependencies, and these vulnerabilities are exploitable during test execution, Pest becomes a vehicle for triggering these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A mocking library used in the test suite has a known remote code execution vulnerability. If an attacker can influence the test execution process or the data used in tests, they might be able to trigger this vulnerability through Pest.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Pest and all its dependencies using Composer.
        *   Use tools like `composer audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Pin dependency versions in `composer.json` to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   Review the security advisories of the libraries used in the test suite.

*   **Attack Surface: Compromised Pest Configuration**
    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies Pest's configuration files (`phpunit.xml` or `pest.php`) to execute arbitrary code or alter test behavior maliciously.
    *   **How Pest Contributes:** Pest reads and interprets configuration files to determine how tests are executed. If these files are writable by an attacker, they can inject malicious code within setup or teardown scripts or modify test suite paths to include malicious files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies `phpunit.xml` to include a `<php>` block that executes a shell command to create a backdoor in the application when tests are run.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, modification of application behavior, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on Pest's configuration files.
        *   Store configuration files in a secure location with appropriate permissions.
        *   Use version control for configuration files and review changes carefully.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
