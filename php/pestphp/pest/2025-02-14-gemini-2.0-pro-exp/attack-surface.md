# Attack Surface Analysis for pestphp/pest

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject or modify test files to execute arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Pest Contribution:** Pest provides the execution environment for these malicious test files. The framework's purpose is to run code, making it a direct enabler.  This is the *most direct* and dangerous aspect.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the `tests/` directory and creates a file `tests/EvilTest.php` containing: `<?php system('rm -rf /'); ?>`. Running Pest executes this command.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data loss, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Codebase Access Control:** Limit write access to the repository and `tests/` directory.
    *   **Rigorous Code Review:** Mandatory code review for *all* changes, including test files.
    *   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate security checks within the CI/CD pipeline, including static analysis of test files.
    *   **Isolated Test Execution Environment:** Run tests in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container) with minimal privileges.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement FIM to detect unauthorized changes to test files.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Test Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/compromised_test_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** A dependency used *only* within tests is compromised, leading to code execution during test runs.
*   **Pest Contribution:** Pest's test runner executes code that relies on these dependencies. Pest's execution is the direct vector.
*   **Example:** A test uses a mocking library that has a vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability during a Pest test run to gain control.
*   **Impact:** Code execution within the test environment, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Audits:** Use tools like `composer audit` or Dependabot.
    *   **Separate Lock File (Optional):** Consider a separate `composer.lock` for test dependencies.
    *   **Careful Dependency Selection:** Choose well-maintained testing libraries.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Dynamic Code Execution in Tests](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_dynamic_code_execution_in_tests.md)

*   **Description:** Developers use `eval()`, `assert()` with string arguments, etc., within tests, and attacker-controlled data reaches these.
*   **Pest Contribution:** Pest provides the environment where this unsafe code is executed. Pest is the direct execution context.
*   **Example:** A test uses `eval('$result = ' . $_GET['input'] . ';');`, and an attacker provides malicious PHP code.
*   **Impact:** Code execution within the test environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review:** Prohibit or heavily scrutinize `eval()` and similar functions in tests.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to detect dangerous functions.
    *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize any external input before use in dynamic code.

## Attack Surface: [Data Providers with Untrusted Input](./attack_surfaces/data_providers_with_untrusted_input.md)

*   **Description:** Pest's data providers source data from an untrusted external source.
*   **Pest Contribution:** Pest's `dataset()` feature facilitates the use of external data in tests, and Pest executes the tests using this data. This is a direct feature of Pest.
*   **Example:** A data provider reads from a CSV file an attacker can modify, injecting malicious data used in a database operation, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Depends on data usage; could be SQL injection, XSS, or code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Data Sources:** Use only trusted data sources (e.g., hardcoded arrays).
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize external data *before* use.
    *   **Separate Test Data:** Store test data securely with restricted access.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Pest Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_pest_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or vulnerable Pest plugin introduces security issues.
*   **Pest Contribution:** Pest's plugin architecture allows third-party code to extend its functionality, and Pest executes this plugin code. This is a direct feature of the Pest ecosystem.
*   **Example:** An attacker publishes a malicious Pest plugin that executes arbitrary code during test runs.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Plugin Selection:** Only use plugins from trusted sources.
    *   **Code Review (Plugins):** Review the source code of plugins.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update plugins.
    *   **Minimal Plugin Usage:** Use only necessary plugins.
