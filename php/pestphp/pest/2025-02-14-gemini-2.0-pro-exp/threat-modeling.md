# Threat Model Analysis for pestphp/pest

## Threat: [Threat 1: Compromised Pest Plugin/Dependency](./threats/threat_1_compromised_pest_plugindependency.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a third-party Pest plugin or a dependency of Pest itself (or a plugin). The attacker injects malicious code into the compromised package. When developers run tests, this malicious code executes on their machines or CI/CD servers. This directly involves Pest because the attack vector is *through* a Pest-related package.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on developer machines or CI/CD servers, potential for lateral movement within the development environment, compromise of the codebase, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Pest Component:**  Any installed Pest plugin (`pestphp/*` packages or third-party plugins).  The `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files, which define the project's dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Dependency Updates:**  Keep Pest and all its dependencies (including plugins) up to date. Use `composer update` regularly and consider using automated dependency update tools (e.g., Dependabot).
        *   **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `composer audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.  Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Vetting Third-Party Plugins:**  Carefully evaluate any third-party Pest plugins before using them.  Consider:
            *   **Reputation:** Is the plugin from a reputable source?
            *   **Maintenance:** Is the plugin actively maintained?
            *   **Security Practices:** Does the plugin author have a good track record for security?
            *   **Code Review:** If possible, review the plugin's source code for potential security issues.
        *   **Pinning Dependencies:** Use `composer.lock` to pin dependencies to specific versions. This prevents unexpected updates from introducing vulnerabilities. However, remember to regularly update the lock file after testing.
        *   **Private Package Repository:**  Consider using a private package repository (e.g., Private Packagist, Satis) to control which packages can be installed and to host internally vetted versions of dependencies.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Data Leakage via Test Output/Logs (When Using Pest Features Incorrectly)](./threats/threat_2_data_leakage_via_test_outputlogs__when_using_pest_features_incorrectly_.md)

* **Description:** While data leakage is a general concern, it becomes *directly* related to Pest when Pest's features are misused to output sensitive data. For example, if a developer uses `dd()` or `dump()` *within a Pest test* to debug a test involving sensitive data, and that output is not properly redacted, this is a direct consequence of using Pest's debugging features. The attacker gains access to CI/CD logs, test reports, or developer machine output.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or other security incidents.
    * **Affected Pest Component:** Pest's output mechanisms, specifically when used in conjunction with debugging functions like `dd()`, `dump()`, or custom logging within tests that handle sensitive data. The Pest runner itself.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Use Real Production Data:** Use mock data, factories, or test-specific environment variables.
        *   **Environment Variable Management:** Use `.env.testing` to isolate test environment variables.
        *   **Redaction in CI/CD:** Configure CI/CD pipelines to redact sensitive information.
        *   **Avoid `dd()` and `dump()` with Sensitive Data:** Be extremely cautious; remove or comment out these calls before committing.
        *   **Custom Logger Configuration:** Configure any custom loggers used within tests to avoid logging sensitive data.
