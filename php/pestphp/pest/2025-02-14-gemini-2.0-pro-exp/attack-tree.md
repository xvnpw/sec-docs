## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/1__execute_arbitrary_code.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Pest's `artisan()` Helper [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The `artisan()` helper in Pest allows tests to execute Laravel Artisan commands.  This is a powerful capability, and if misused or exploited, it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Why Critical:**  Artisan commands can perform a wide range of actions, including database modifications, file system operations, and even running shell commands.  Compromising this helper gives an attacker significant control over the application and potentially the server.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1 Inject Malicious Artisan Commands**
            *   **1.1.1.1 Via Test Input (if `artisan()` input is not sanitized) [HIGH RISK]**
                *   **Description:** If the test code passes user-supplied or externally-influenced data directly to the `artisan()` helper without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious Artisan commands or command options.
                *   **Example:**  `test('vulnerable test', function () { $userInput = $_GET['command']; artisan($userInput); });`
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High (RCE)
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *any* data passed to `artisan()`. Use whitelisting of allowed commands and options, rather than blacklisting.
            *   **1.1.1.2 Via Environment Variables (if `artisan()` uses unsanitized env vars) [HIGH RISK]**
                *   **Description:** If the `artisan()` helper uses environment variables that can be controlled or influenced by an attacker, and these variables are not properly sanitized, it can lead to command injection.
                *   **Example:**  `test('vulnerable test', function () { artisan('some:command --option=' . env('VULNERABLE_ENV')); });` (If `VULNERABLE_ENV` can be set by the attacker)
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High (RCE)
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Mitigation:** Sanitize environment variables used within `artisan()` calls in tests. Avoid directly using user-supplied or externally-influenced environment variables in sensitive commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit Pest's Dataset Feature](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_pest's_dataset_feature.md)

*   **1.2.1 Inject Malicious Code into Dataset Values (if datasets are not properly escaped) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Pest's dataset feature allows tests to be run with multiple sets of data. If these dataset values are used in contexts where code execution is possible (e.g., within `eval()`, shell commands, or database queries) without proper escaping, an attacker could inject malicious code.
    *   **Example:** `test('vulnerable test', function ($data) { eval($data); })->with(['malicious php code']);`
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure that dataset values are properly escaped and sanitized *before* being used in any context where code execution is possible.  Avoid using `eval()` or similar constructs with user-supplied data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Pest's Plugin System [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_pest's_plugin_system__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Pest plugins can extend the functionality of Pest.  A malicious or compromised plugin could introduce vulnerabilities that lead to RCE or other security issues.
    *   **Why Critical:** Plugins have access to the Pest testing environment and can potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Mitigation:** Carefully vet any third-party Pest plugins before installing them. Review the plugin's source code for potential vulnerabilities. Use a dependency management system (like Composer) to manage plugin versions and ensure they are up-to-date. Regularly update Pest plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Exploit Pest's Underlying PHPUnit Dependencies [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_exploit_pest's_underlying_phpunit_dependencies__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Pest is built on top of PHPUnit.  Vulnerabilities in PHPUnit can therefore impact Pest.
    *   **Why Critical:** PHPUnit is a fundamental component of Pest's testing infrastructure.  Vulnerabilities in PHPUnit could allow an attacker to bypass Pest's security mechanisms.
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep PHPUnit and its dependencies up-to-date. Monitor security advisories for PHPUnit.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leak Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/2__leak_sensitive_information.md)

*   **2.1 Access Sensitive Data Through Unintentional Exposure in Tests**
    *   **2.1.1 Dump Environment Variables in Test Output [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Developers might accidentally print environment variables (which often contain secrets like API keys or database credentials) to the test output for debugging purposes.
        *   **Example:** `test('debug env', function () { dump($_ENV); });`
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the sensitivity of the variables)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
        *   **Mitigation:** Avoid printing sensitive environment variables or configuration values in test output. Use Pest's debugging features carefully and only in controlled environments.
    *   **2.1.4 Expose Sensitive Data via `dump()` or `dd()` [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  Similar to dumping environment variables, developers might use `dump()` or `dd()` to inspect variables during debugging, potentially exposing sensitive data in the test output.
        *   **Example:** `test('debug data', function () { dd($sensitiveData); });`
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the data dumped)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
        *   **Mitigation:** Avoid using `dump()` or `dd()` with sensitive data in tests that might be run in less secure environments (e.g., CI/CD). Remove or comment out these debugging statements before committing code.
