# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pestphp/pest

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Transaction Management with Pest](./mitigation_strategies/database_transaction_management_with_pest.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Consistently utilize Pest's features for managing database transactions to ensure test isolation.

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Leverage `uses()`:**  In your Pest test files (or globally in `tests/Pest.php`), use the `uses()` function with appropriate database traits.  For Laravel, this is typically `RefreshDatabase` or `DatabaseTransactions`.  This ensures that each test (or test file, depending on the trait) is wrapped in a transaction.  Example: `uses(RefreshDatabase::class);` or `uses(DatabaseTransactions::class);`
    2.  **Understand Trait Behavior:** Be aware of the differences between `RefreshDatabase` (which typically truncates tables between tests) and `DatabaseTransactions` (which rolls back changes). Choose the trait that best suits your testing needs and performance requirements.
    3.  **Avoid Manual Transaction Control (Usually):**  Rely on the provided traits whenever possible.  Manual transaction control (e.g., `DB::beginTransaction()`, `DB::rollBack()`) within Pest tests is generally discouraged unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason, as it can lead to inconsistencies.
    4.  **Test Transaction Boundaries:** If you have complex test setups or teardowns, consider adding assertions to verify that database changes are being rolled back correctly. This can help catch issues where transactions are not being handled as expected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Prevents tests from inadvertently modifying or deleting data in the test database, ensuring that each test starts with a clean state.
    *   **Test Interference (Severity: Medium):** Prevents one test from affecting the results of another due to lingering database changes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced to near zero if transactions are used correctly.
    *   **Test Interference:** Risk significantly reduced, leading to more reliable and predictable test results.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `uses(RefreshDatabase::class)`: Used in some test files, but not consistently across all database-interacting tests.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent application of `uses(RefreshDatabase::class)` (or `DatabaseTransactions::class`, as appropriate) in *all* test files that interact with the database.
    *   Verification of transaction boundaries in complex test scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment Variable Mocking with Pest](./mitigation_strategies/environment_variable_mocking_with_pest.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Utilize Pest's (and underlying PHPUnit's) capabilities to mock environment variables within tests, controlling the application's behavior without affecting the real environment.

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Identify Environment Dependencies:** Determine which parts of your application code rely on environment variables.
    2.  **Use `putenv()` (with Caution):** Within individual tests, you can use PHP's `putenv()` function to temporarily set or override environment variables.  Example: `putenv('API_KEY=test_key');`.  Be aware that `putenv()` affects the global environment for the duration of the PHP process, so it's crucial to use it carefully within tests.
    3. **Prefer `.env.testing`:** For broader environment settings that apply to all or most tests, use a dedicated `.env.testing` file. Pest (and Laravel) will automatically load this file when running tests. This is generally preferred over using `putenv()` within individual tests.
    4.  **Restore Original Values (If Necessary):** If you use `putenv()`, consider restoring the original environment variable values after the test, especially if you're modifying variables that might affect other tests.  You can store the original value before modifying it and then restore it in a `tearDown()` method or using Pest's `afterEach()` hook.
    5. **Consider Mocking Libraries:** For more complex mocking scenarios, consider using a dedicated mocking library (like Mockery) in conjunction with Pest. This can provide more fine-grained control over mocked objects and their behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (Severity: High):** Prevents tests from accidentally using real API keys or other secrets by allowing you to mock them.
    *   **Configuration-Based Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Allows you to test your application's behavior with different configuration settings without affecting the real environment.
    *   **Test Flakiness (Severity: Low):** Reduces test flakiness caused by inconsistent environment variables.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced by allowing you to mock sensitive environment variables.
    *   **Configuration-Based Attacks:** Risk reduced by enabling controlled testing of different configuration scenarios.
    *   **Test Flakiness:** Risk reduced by providing a consistent and predictable test environment.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `.env.testing`: Yes, used for general test environment configuration.
    *   `putenv()`: Used sporadically in some tests, but not consistently or with a clear strategy.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent and strategic use of `putenv()` (or a mocking library) for mocking environment variables within tests, with proper restoration of original values where necessary.
    *   Clear documentation of which environment variables are mocked and why.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pest Test Grouping and CI/CD Integration](./mitigation_strategies/pest_test_grouping_and_cicd_integration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Leverage Pest's test grouping features and integrate with CI/CD to control test execution in different environments.

*   **Description (Step-by-Step):**
    1.  **Organize Tests:** Use Pest's grouping features (e.g., `@group` annotations or directory-based organization) to categorize your tests (e.g., unit, integration, feature, security).
    2.  **Configure Pest:**  Use Pest's configuration options (e.g., in `phpunit.xml` or through command-line arguments) to specify which test groups to run.
    3.  **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Configure your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to run different test groups in different environments.  For example:
        *   Run unit tests on every commit.
        *   Run integration tests on a staging environment.
        *   Run security-specific tests periodically or before deployments.
    4.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Use environment variables (e.g., `APP_ENV`) within your CI/CD pipeline to control which test groups are executed and to configure Pest accordingly.
    5. **Use Pest's CLI:** Utilize Pest's command-line interface (CLI) options (e.g., `--group`, `--exclude-group`) to selectively run or exclude specific test groups.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Production Execution (Severity: Critical):** Prevents tests that might modify data or interact with external services from being run against the production environment.
    *   **Inefficient Test Execution (Severity: Low):** Allows you to run only the relevant tests for a given environment or change, speeding up the feedback loop.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Production Execution:** Risk reduced to near zero with proper CI/CD integration and test grouping.
    *   **Inefficient Test Execution:** Risk reduced by allowing targeted test execution.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   CI/CD Integration: Yes, using GitHub Actions.
    *   Basic Test Grouping: Some tests are grouped, but not systematically or with a clear strategy for CI/CD integration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic organization of *all* tests into well-defined groups (unit, integration, feature, security).
    *   Configuration of the CI/CD pipeline to run specific test groups based on the environment and the type of change.
    *   Use of Pest's CLI options to control test execution within the CI/CD pipeline.
