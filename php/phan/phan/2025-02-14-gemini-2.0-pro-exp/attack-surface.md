# Attack Surface Analysis for phan/phan

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in third-party Phan plugins or create malicious plugins to execute arbitrary code or compromise the analysis process.

**How Phan Contributes:** Phan's plugin architecture allows for extending functionality, but also introduces a risk from external code that executes *within* Phan's process.  This is a *direct* involvement.

**Example:** An attacker publishes a malicious plugin named "phan-security-enhancer" on Packagist. A developer installs it, and the plugin steals API keys from the codebase during analysis. Or, a legitimate plugin has a vulnerability that allows code execution when Phan processes a crafted PHP file.

**Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution within the Phan analysis context.
    *   Compromise of the build server or developer workstation.
    *   Data exfiltration (source code, credentials).
    *   Code modification (injection of backdoors).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Thoroughly vet any third-party plugins. Examine source code, check author reputation, and look for security advisories.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (e.g., Composer) and lock files.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool.
    *   **Sandboxing (Ideal, but Difficult):** Ideally, run Phan and plugins in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run Phan with minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep plugins updated.

## Attack Surface: [Phan Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/phan_core_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitable vulnerabilities within the core Phan codebase itself (parsing, type inference, etc.).

**How Phan Contributes:** This is *inherently* and *directly* related to Phan, as it concerns vulnerabilities *within* Phan's own code.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a PHP file with a deeply nested, unusual combination of language features that triggers a buffer overflow in Phan's parser, leading to code execution. Or, a flaw in type inference allows a type confusion vulnerability to be missed.

**Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution (less likely than plugins, but high impact).
    *   Denial of service (crashing Phan).
    *   Incorrect analysis results (false negatives or positives).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Phan Updated:** Always use the latest stable version of Phan.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Phan's security announcements.
    *   **Contribute to Phan Security (Advanced):** Report vulnerabilities or review code.
    *   **Fuzzing (for Phan maintainers):** Phan maintainers should regularly fuzz.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers modify Phan's configuration file (`.phan/config.php` or similar) to alter its behavior, disable security checks, or introduce malicious actions.

**How Phan Contributes:** Phan's behavior is *directly* controlled by its configuration. The configuration file *is* part of how Phan operates.

**Example:** An attacker changes the configuration to disable taint analysis (`'enable_taint_analysis' => false`), allowing SQL injection. Or, they add a malicious plugin path, *which Phan will then load*.

**Impact:**
    *   Disabled security checks.
    *   False negatives/positives.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution (via malicious plugins loaded through config).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Treat Configuration as Code:** Store in version control (e.g., Git).
    *   **Code Reviews:** Require code reviews for *any* configuration changes.
    *   **Access Control:** Restrict write access to authorized developers/build systems.
    *   **Configuration Validation:** Validate the configuration file's integrity before Phan runs.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Phan with minimum necessary permissions.
