## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Phan's Analysis Engine (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_phan's_analysis_engine__high-risk_.md)

*   **1. Exploit Phan's Analysis Engine (HIGH-RISK):** This branch focuses on vulnerabilities within Phan's core code analysis capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Phan Bug (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_phan_bug__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Phan Bug (HIGH-RISK):**  Exploiting bugs in Phan's parsing or analysis logic.
    *   **1.1.1 (Vulnerability in parser) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** A flaw in how Phan parses PHP code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a carefully crafted input is provided. This could involve complex combinations of language features or edge cases not properly handled by the parser.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Misuse of Phan Features (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_misuse_of_phan_features__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.2 Misuse of Phan Features (HIGH-RISK):** Exploiting intended features of Phan in unintended ways.
    *   **1.2.2 (Malicious plugin) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  Installing a Phan plugin that contains malicious code. This code would be executed during Phan's analysis phase, potentially granting the attacker control over the server. The plugin could be installed intentionally, through a compromised dependency, or by exploiting a vulnerability in Phan's plugin loading mechanism.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low (if a pre-built malicious plugin is available) to High (if a custom plugin needs to be developed)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Phan's Configuration (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_phan's_configuration__high-risk_.md)

*   **2. Manipulate Phan's Configuration (HIGH-RISK):** This branch focuses on altering Phan's configuration to weaken security or introduce malicious behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Inject Malicious Config (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_inject_malicious_config__high-risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Inject Malicious Config (HIGH-RISK):**  Modifying Phan's configuration file to change its behavior.
    *   **2.1.1 (Modifying .phan/config.php) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** Gaining write access to the `.phan/config.php` file and altering its contents.  This could disable security checks, point Phan to malicious plugins, modify analysis settings to hide vulnerabilities, or change output paths.  Access could be gained through various means, such as a compromised developer machine, a vulnerability in the CI/CD pipeline, or a server-side vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

    *   **2.1.2 (Malicious autoloader) (HIGH-RISK):**
        *   **Description:**  Specifying a malicious autoloader in Phan's configuration.  This autoloader would be responsible for loading PHP classes, and a malicious version could load compromised code, leading to code execution during Phan's analysis.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
