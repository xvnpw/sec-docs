## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Phan's Analysis Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phan's_analysis_logic.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses in how Phan analyzes code, causing it to overlook genuine security vulnerabilities. This can involve crafting specific code patterns that confuse Phan's analysis engine or leveraging known limitations in its type inference or rule sets.

**Impact:** If successful, critical vulnerabilities will remain undetected, potentially leading to their deployment and subsequent exploitation by attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Phan's Configuration or Execution Environment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phan's_configuration_or_execution_environment.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target the configuration files or the environment where Phan is running. This could involve gaining unauthorized access to configuration files to modify settings or exploiting vulnerabilities in the PHP environment itself.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to disable security checks within Phan, exclude vulnerable code from analysis, or even gain control of the server running Phan, leading to widespread compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting Developers Using Phan](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_developers_using_phan.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate developers' trust in Phan's findings or exploit their fatigue from false positives. This can involve convincing developers that malicious code is safe because Phan didn't report any issues or subtly introducing vulnerabilities that Phan might miss, relying on developers' overconfidence in the tool.

**Impact:** This can lead to the introduction of vulnerable code into the application, bypassing technical security measures and creating opportunities for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious Code That Bypasses Phan's Detection](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_code_that_bypasses_phan's_detection.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers intentionally write code designed to evade Phan's static analysis. This often involves using obfuscation techniques, exploiting limitations in Phan's type inference, or leveraging code sections that Phan is configured to ignore.

**Impact:** Critical vulnerabilities within this crafted code will go undetected by Phan, increasing the likelihood of their deployment and subsequent exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Socially engineer developers to add suppressions for malicious code.](./attack_tree_paths/socially_engineer_developers_to_add_suppressions_for_malicious_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate developers into adding `@phan-suppress` annotations to intentionally malicious code. This could be achieved through subtle code reviews, convincing arguments, or exploiting developer fatigue.

**Impact:**  This directly instructs Phan to ignore the malicious code, effectively bypassing its security checks and allowing the vulnerable code to be deployed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Phan's Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_phan's_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Phan's configuration files and modify them to weaken its security posture.

**Impact:** This allows attackers to disable crucial security checks, exclude vulnerable files or directories from analysis, or potentially introduce malicious plugins, significantly reducing Phan's effectiveness.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable Security Checks (within Configuration Manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/disable_security_checks__within_configuration_manipulation_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  A specific action within the "Manipulate Phan's Configuration Files" path, where attackers directly disable rules or checks that would normally detect vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** This renders Phan ineffective at identifying specific types of vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of their deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exclude Vulnerable Files or Directories (within Configuration Manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/exclude_vulnerable_files_or_directories__within_configuration_manipulation_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Another specific action within "Manipulate Phan's Configuration Files," where attackers prevent Phan from analyzing critical parts of the codebase that might contain vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Vulnerabilities within the excluded code will not be detected by Phan, leading to a false sense of security and increasing the risk of exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause False Negatives Leading to Deployment of Vulnerable Code](./attack_tree_paths/cause_false_negatives_leading_to_deployment_of_vulnerable_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path represents the culmination of efforts to make Phan miss critical vulnerabilities. If successful, the lack of warnings from Phan leads to the vulnerable code being deployed into the application.

**Impact:** The deployed vulnerabilities can then be exploited by attackers to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Developer Trust in Phan's Findings](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_developer_trust_in_phan's_findings.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the developers' reliance on Phan's output. If Phan doesn't report an issue, developers might assume the code is safe, even if it contains subtle vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** This can lead to the introduction of vulnerable code that developers believe is secure, creating opportunities for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Convince Developers That Malicious Code is Safe Based on Phan's Lack of Warnings](./attack_tree_paths/convince_developers_that_malicious_code_is_safe_based_on_phan's_lack_of_warnings.md)

**Attack Vector:** A specific instance of exploiting developer trust, where attackers present malicious code and point to Phan's lack of warnings as proof of its safety.

**Impact:** Developers might unknowingly approve and deploy malicious code, believing it to be secure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Subtle Vulnerabilities That Phan Doesn't Detect](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_subtle_vulnerabilities_that_phan_doesn't_detect.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers introduce vulnerabilities that are designed to be difficult for static analysis tools like Phan to identify. This relies on the limitations of Phan's analysis capabilities.

**Impact:** These subtle vulnerabilities can slip through the automated checks and be deployed into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Developer Fatigue from False Positives](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_developer_fatigue_from_false_positives.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers rely on the fact that a high volume of false positives from Phan can lead to developer fatigue and a tendency to ignore warnings, potentially overlooking real vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Real vulnerabilities might be missed amidst the noise of false positives, leading to their deployment and potential exploitation.
