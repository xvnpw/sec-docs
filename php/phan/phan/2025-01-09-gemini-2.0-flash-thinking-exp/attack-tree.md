# Attack Tree Analysis for phan/phan

Objective: To compromise the application that uses Phan by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Phan itself, leading to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Exploit Phan's Analysis Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/directly_exploit_phan's_analysis_logic__critical_node_.md)

This represents a fundamental attack on Phan's core functionality. If successful, the attacker can undermine the entire purpose of using Phan for security analysis.

Attack Vectors:

*   Manipulating input code to trick Phan's analysis engine.
*   Altering Phan's configuration or extending it with malicious plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Input Code to Mislead Analysis [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_input_code_to_mislead_analysis__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers craft malicious code specifically designed to evade Phan's detection mechanisms.

Attack Vectors:

*   **Inject Malicious Code that Phan Ignores:** Injecting PHP code that Phan's parser or analysis engine fails to recognize as malicious. This could involve using obscure language features, exploiting parsing vulnerabilities, or crafting code with unusual control flow.
*   **Exploit Phan's Type Inference Weaknesses:** Crafting code that leverages limitations or bugs in Phan's type inference system. This can lead to type confusion vulnerabilities where Phan incorrectly assumes a variable or object is of a safe type, allowing for exploitation later in the application's execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Phan's Configuration or Plugins [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_phan's_configuration_or_plugins__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to control Phan's behavior by altering its settings or extending its functionality with malicious code.

Attack Vectors:

*   **Inject Malicious Configuration Settings:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application loads or processes Phan's configuration files. This could involve path traversal to overwrite configuration files, insecure deserialization of configuration data, or injecting malicious settings through environment variables or command-line arguments if improperly handled.
*   **Introduce Malicious Phan Plugins:** Developing or distributing malicious Phan plugins that are then loaded by the application. These plugins can execute arbitrary code during Phan's analysis, potentially compromising the development environment, modifying the codebase being analyzed, or even introducing backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Phan's Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_phan's_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers target known security flaws in the third-party libraries that Phan relies on.

Attack Vectors:

*   **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Phan's Libraries:** Identifying and exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Phan's dependencies. This often involves using existing exploits or adapting them to the specific context of Phan's usage. The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure during Phan's execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Influence Developer Actions Based on Misleading Phan Output [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/influence_developer_actions_based_on_misleading_phan_output__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit the trust developers place in Phan's output to introduce vulnerabilities indirectly.

Attack Vectors:

*   **Exploit False Negatives in Phan's Reports:** Crafting code that contains real vulnerabilities but is not flagged by Phan. This relies on limitations in Phan's analysis capabilities or the introduction of new vulnerability patterns that Phan doesn't yet recognize. Developers, trusting Phan's report, may deploy this vulnerable code to production.
