# Threat Model Analysis for phan/phan

## Threat: [Undetected Vulnerability due to Incomplete Analysis](./threats/undetected_vulnerability_due_to_incomplete_analysis.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application that Phan failed to identify during static analysis. This could involve the attacker sending crafted input, manipulating application state, or exploiting logical flaws in the code that Phan's rules didn't cover.

**Impact:**  The application is vulnerable to exploitation, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service, or other security incidents depending on the nature of the missed vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Phan's core analysis engine and configured rule sets.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Do not rely solely on Phan for security assessments. Combine with other security testing methods like dynamic analysis (DAST), penetration testing, and manual code reviews.
* Regularly update Phan to the latest version to benefit from new rules and bug fixes.
* Carefully configure Phan's rule sets to match the specific security requirements of the application.
* Investigate and address any "UnclearFixableType" or similar warnings, as these might indicate areas where Phan's analysis is limited.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within Phan Itself](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within_phan_itself.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within the Phan tool itself. This could involve providing specially crafted PHP code that triggers a bug in Phan's parser or analysis engine, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the Phan process or denial of service.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the development environment or CI/CD pipeline where Phan is running. This could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the application build or gain access to sensitive development resources.

**Affected Component:**  Various modules within Phan, including the parser, analyzer, and potentially dependency handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Phan updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor Phan's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
* Run Phan in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
* Be cautious about analyzing untrusted or potentially malicious code with Phan.
