                *   **2.2.2.1. Attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline where Phan is executed, modifying analysis results or injecting malicious code (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker gains control of the CI/CD pipeline and manipulates the Phan analysis process. This could involve modifying Phan's configuration in the pipeline, injecting malicious code into the application during the build process (after Phan analysis, rendering it ineffective), or altering Phan's output to hide vulnerabilities.
                    *   **Risk Level:** Critical. CI/CD pipeline compromise is a severe supply chain attack. Attackers can inject malicious code into application builds, bypass security checks (including Phan), and distribute compromised software to a wide user base.
