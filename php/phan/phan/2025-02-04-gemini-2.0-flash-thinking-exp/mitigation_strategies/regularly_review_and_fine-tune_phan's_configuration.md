        *   **Suppression Creep:**  Over time, suppressions can accumulate without proper review, masking real issues.
        *   **False Sense of Security:**  Excessive suppressions can create a false sense of security if real issues are being ignored.
        *   **Documentation Burden:**  Maintaining clear and up-to-date documentation for each suppression is crucial but often neglected.

*   **2.4. Custom Phan configuration options**
    *   **Analysis:** Phan offers various custom configuration options. Reviewing these ensures they are still relevant, correctly configured, and aligned with current project needs and coding standards.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Fine-grained Control:** Custom options allow for precise tailoring of Phan's behavior.
        *   **Adaptability:** Enables Phan to be configured to specific project requirements and coding styles.
    *   **Challenges:**
        *   **Configuration Complexity:**  Understanding and managing custom options can add complexity to Phan's configuration.
        *   **Configuration Drift:** Custom options might become outdated or misconfigured over time if not regularly reviewed.

**Step 3: Adjust Phan configuration based on review**

*   **Analysis:** This step involves acting upon the findings of the analysis in Step 2.  It's about making concrete changes to Phan's configuration files. The described actions (modifying `analysis_level`, plugins, suppressions, custom options) are directly derived from the analysis points in Step 2.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Configuration Optimization:**  Ensures Phan's configuration is actively improved based on identified needs and issues.
    *   **Continuous Improvement:**  Regular adjustments lead to a continuously improving static analysis setup.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Potential for Errors:**  Incorrect configuration changes can negatively impact Phan's effectiveness.
