# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project aims to provide a static analysis tool for PHP, named Phan.

- Business Priorities:
  - Improve the quality and security of PHP codebases.
  - Reduce the number of bugs and vulnerabilities in PHP applications.
  - Enforce coding standards and best practices in PHP development.
  - Increase developer productivity by automating code analysis.

- Business Goals:
  - Offer a robust and accurate static analysis tool for PHP.
  - Provide actionable insights and recommendations to developers for code improvement.
  - Integrate seamlessly into existing PHP development workflows.
  - Support a wide range of PHP versions and frameworks.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk of false positives and false negatives in static analysis results, leading to developer frustration or missed vulnerabilities.
  - Risk of performance overhead during code analysis, impacting development speed.
  - Risk of vulnerabilities within Phan itself, potentially affecting the security of analyzed projects.
  - Risk of limited adoption if the tool is not user-friendly or does not provide sufficient value.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository with standard GitHub security features (e.g., branch protection, vulnerability scanning for dependencies). Implemented by: GitHub.
  - security control: Open-source development model allowing for community review and contributions. Implemented by: GitHub repository and community.
  - security control: Reliance on PHP's security features and ecosystem. Implemented by: PHP runtime environment.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Inherent limitations of static analysis, leading to potential false positives and false negatives.
  - accepted risk: Performance impact of static analysis on development workflows.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Phan.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Regular security audits of Phan's codebase to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Input validation and sanitization of analyzed PHP code to prevent code injection or other attacks against Phan itself.
  - security control: Dependency scanning and management to ensure Phan's dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Secure release process for Phan to prevent tampering or malicious modifications.
  - security control: Implementation of SAST (Static Application Security Testing) principles in Phan's design to minimize false negatives and improve accuracy.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to Phan as a command-line tool. If Phan were to offer a web interface or API in the future, authentication would be required to control access.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to Phan as a command-line tool. Access control to the Phan repository and releases is managed by GitHub.
  - Input Validation: Critical for Phan. Phan must robustly handle and validate PHP code input to prevent vulnerabilities such as code injection or denial-of-service attacks against the analysis engine itself. This includes handling various PHP syntax constructs, file encodings, and potentially malicious code patterns.
  - Cryptography: Not directly required for Phan's core functionality of static analysis. Cryptography might be relevant if Phan were to implement features like secure updates or plugin verification in the future.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development of PHP applications.
  - Ensuring the quality and security of PHP code.
  - Maintaining developer productivity.

- Data to Protect:
  - PHP Source Code: Sensitivity varies depending on the project. For proprietary software, it is highly sensitive intellectual property. For open-source projects, it is publicly available but still needs to be protected from unauthorized modification in the repository.
  - Analysis Results: Potentially sensitive if they reveal vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in the code. Should be protected from unauthorized access or disclosure, especially in CI/CD environments.
  - Phan's Source Code: Needs to be protected to maintain the integrity and security of the tool itself.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - PHP Source Code: High to Public (depending on the project).
  - Analysis Results: Medium to High (depending on the findings and context).
  - Phan's Source Code: Medium (open source, but integrity is important).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any plans to offer a web-based interface or API for Phan in the future? (Assumption: Currently CLI only).
  - Are there any mechanisms for users to contribute custom analysis rules or plugins? (Assumption: Plugin system exists or is planned).
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in Phan itself? (Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability reporting process).
  - How is Phan tested and validated to ensure accuracy and minimize false positives/negatives? (Assumption: Testing and validation are part of the development process).

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve PHP code quality and security for developers.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is a significant concern, both for the analyzed code and for Phan itself. Standard open-source security practices are followed.
  - DESIGN: Phan is primarily a command-line tool, distributed as a PHAR file or via Composer. It is designed to be integrated into developer workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
