Here are the high and critical attack surfaces that directly involve the `reset-password-bundle`:

* **Attack Surface: Predictable Password Reset Tokens**
    * **Description:** The password reset tokens generated by the bundle are predictable or easily guessable due to a weak generation algorithm or insufficient entropy.
    * **How Reset-Password-Bundle Contributes:** The bundle is responsible for generating these tokens. If its default configuration or implementation uses a weak method, it directly contributes to this vulnerability.
    * **Example:** Tokens are generated using a simple sequential counter or a timestamp with low precision. An attacker could potentially predict future or past tokens.
    * **Impact:** Account Takeover (attacker can directly access the password reset form with a valid token for a target user).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the bundle is configured to use a cryptographically secure random number generator for token creation.
        * Verify the token length and complexity are sufficient to prevent brute-force or guessing attacks.
        * Regularly review and update the bundle to benefit from security improvements.

* **Attack Surface: Password Reset Token Reuse**
    * **Description:** A password reset token can be used multiple times to reset a user's password.
    * **How Reset-Password-Bundle Contributes:** If the bundle's logic or the application's implementation doesn't properly invalidate tokens after their first use, it creates this vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts a password reset link but doesn't immediately use it. They later use the same link again to reset the password, potentially after the legitimate user has already done so.
    * **Impact:** Account Takeover (attacker can reset the password even after the legitimate user has changed it).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the application logic invalidates the password reset token immediately after it's successfully used to reset the password.
        * The bundle likely provides mechanisms for this; ensure they are correctly implemented.

* **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on Password Reset Form**
    * **Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into submitting a password reset request without their knowledge or consent.
    * **How Reset-Password-Bundle Contributes:** The bundle facilitates the creation of the password reset form. If this form lacks proper CSRF protection, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker embeds a malicious password reset request within an image tag or iframe on a website the victim visits while logged into the target application.
    * **Impact:** Account Takeover (attacker can initiate a password reset for the victim's account).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the password reset form generated or used in conjunction with the bundle implements proper CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., using Symfony's CSRF protection features).
