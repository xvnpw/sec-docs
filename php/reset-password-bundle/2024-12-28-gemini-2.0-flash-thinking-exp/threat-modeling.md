Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `SymfonyCasts/reset-password-bundle`:

*   **Threat:** Predictable Reset Tokens
    *   **Description:** If the `TokenGenerator` within the bundle uses a weak or predictable algorithm, an attacker could potentially guess valid reset tokens for other users. They could then use these predicted tokens via the bundle's controllers to initiate password resets and take over accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Complete account takeover for targeted users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `TokenGenerator` service (specifically the `generateToken()` method).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the bundle's `TokenGenerator` is configured to use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG).
        *   Verify that the generated tokens have sufficient length and entropy.

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Token Length or Entropy
    *   **Description:** Even if not entirely predictable, if the tokens generated by the bundle are too short or lack sufficient randomness, an attacker could attempt to brute-force the token space. They would try numerous possible tokens via the bundle's password reset flow until they find a valid one.
    *   **Impact:** Potential account takeover through brute-force attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `TokenGenerator` service (specifically the `generateToken()` method).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the bundle to generate tokens with a minimum length of 32 bytes (256 bits) of cryptographically secure random data.

*   **Threat:** Token Leakage in Logs or Error Messages
    *   **Description:** The bundle might inadvertently log the generated reset tokens during the password reset process, or these tokens could be exposed in error messages if exceptions occur within the bundle's code. Attackers gaining access to these logs could extract valid tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover for users whose tokens are leaked.
    *   **Affected Component:** Logging within the bundle's services or controllers, error handling within the bundle.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review the bundle's code and configuration to ensure sensitive data like reset tokens are not being logged.
        *   Implement robust error handling to prevent the exposure of sensitive information in error messages.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Token Storage
    *   **Description:** The `ResetPasswordRequestRepository` (or the underlying mechanism used by the bundle to store reset request information, including the token) might be vulnerable to security flaws. If this storage is compromised (e.g., through SQL injection if the repository directly interacts with the database without proper sanitization), attackers could gain access to all active reset tokens managed by the bundle.
    *   **Impact:** Mass account takeover.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ResetPasswordRequestRepository` (and potentially its interaction with the database).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `ResetPasswordRequestRepository` uses secure methods for interacting with the database, preventing vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
        *   Consider encrypting the reset tokens at rest within the storage mechanism used by the bundle.

*   **Threat:** Failure to Invalidate Tokens After Use
    *   **Description:** If the bundle's logic fails to properly invalidate a reset token after it has been successfully used to reset a password, an attacker who previously obtained the token could potentially reuse it to reset the password again.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized password reset even after the legitimate user has changed their password.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ResetPasswordController` (specifically the logic that handles the password update and token invalidation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the `ResetPasswordController` code to ensure the token invalidation logic is correctly implemented and executed after a successful password reset.
        *   Implement unit and integration tests specifically to verify the token invalidation process.

*   **Threat:** Unencrypted Password Reset Link (HTTP)
    *   **Description:** If the bundle (or the application's integration with the bundle) generates the password reset link using HTTP instead of HTTPS, the token embedded in the URL could be intercepted by an attacker on the network.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover if the intercepted token is used before the legitimate user.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The part of the bundle or the application's code responsible for generating the password reset link URL (likely within the `RequestPasswordController` or related services).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the application's routing and URL generation are configured to always use HTTPS for password reset links.
        *   Enforce HTTPS for the entire application.
