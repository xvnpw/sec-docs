### High and Critical Fat-Free Framework Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Fat-Free Framework:

*   **Threat:** Template Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) into template variables if user-controlled data is not properly sanitized or escaped before being rendered by F3's templating engine. The attacker might achieve this by submitting crafted input through forms, URL parameters, or other input vectors that are directly used within the template.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Affected Fat-Free Component:**  Templating Engine (specifically the rendering process of template files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always escape output:** Use F3's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{ var | esc }}`) for all user-controlled data displayed in templates.
        *   **Sanitize user input:**  Validate and sanitize user input before using it in templates to remove or neutralize potentially malicious code.

*   **Threat:** Insecure use of `\Base::instance()` leading to potential bypasses
    *   **Description:** If developers inadvertently expose the `\Base::instance()` object or its methods in a way that is accessible to user input or external manipulation, attackers could potentially bypass security checks or alter the application's behavior by directly interacting with the framework's core.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or complete application compromise depending on the exposed methods and the attacker's ability to manipulate them.
    *   **Affected Fat-Free Component:**  Core Framework (`\Base` class).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid exposing the `\Base` object directly:**  Do not pass the `\Base` instance to untrusted code or make its methods directly accessible through user input.
        *   **Follow the principle of least privilege:**  Grant access to framework functionalities only when absolutely necessary and through well-defined interfaces.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Session Management if Relying Solely on F3's Defaults
    *   **Description:** Relying solely on F3's default session management configuration without implementing additional security measures can leave the application vulnerable to session hijacking or fixation attacks. This includes not setting secure and HTTPOnly flags on cookies.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
    *   **Affected Fat-Free Component:** Session Management Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure secure session cookies:** Ensure the `httponly` and `secure` flags are set for session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access and transmission over insecure connections.
        *   **Implement session regeneration:** Regenerate the session ID after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
        *   **Set appropriate session timeouts:** Configure reasonable session timeouts to limit the window of opportunity for session hijacking.
