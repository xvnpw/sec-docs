*   **Route Parameter Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route parameters (e.g., `/user/@id`) to inject malicious data.
    *   **How FatFree Contributes:** FFF's routing system directly passes these parameters to the route handler. If developers don't explicitly sanitize or validate these parameters, they become vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A URL like `/file/../../../../etc/passwd` targeting a route expecting a filename parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Path traversal leading to unauthorized file access, potential SQL injection if used in database queries, command injection if used in system calls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Use appropriate sanitization functions (e.g., `filter_var` in PHP) to clean route parameters before using them.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate the format and content of route parameters against expected patterns (e.g., using regular expressions or whitelists).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application has only the necessary permissions to access files and resources.
        *   **Avoid Direct File Access Based on User Input:**  If possible, map user-provided identifiers to internal, safe file references.

*   **Template Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template variables that are then executed by the templating engine.
    *   **How FatFree Contributes:** If developers directly embed user-supplied data into FFF templates without proper escaping, the templating engine will render it as code.
    *   **Example:**  A comment form where the submitted comment is directly displayed in the template without escaping HTML entities, allowing injection of `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. In more severe cases (though less likely with FFF's simple engine), Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) could lead to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Always escape user-provided data before displaying it in templates. FFF provides mechanisms for this. Use appropriate escaping based on the context (HTML, JavaScript, URL).
        *   **Avoid Raw Output:**  Minimize the use of raw output or unescaped variables in templates.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

*   **Lack of Built-in Input Validation/Sanitization**
    *   **Description:** FFF, being a micro-framework, provides minimal built-in input validation or sanitization.
    *   **How FatFree Contributes:** FFF relies on developers to handle input validation and sanitization explicitly. This lack of built-in protection increases the risk if developers fail to implement these measures.
    *   **Example:**  A form submission where user-provided data is directly used in a database query without any validation, leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Various vulnerabilities depending on the context of the unsanitized input, including SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs on the server-side. Define expected data types, formats, and ranges.
        *   **Implement Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user inputs to remove or encode potentially harmful characters or code.
        *   **Use Validation Libraries:** Integrate external validation libraries for more robust and reusable validation logic.
        *   **Framework-Agnostic Security Practices:**  Apply general secure coding practices for handling user input.

*   **Insecure Session Management (Default Configuration)**
    *   **Description:**  If the default session configuration is used without modification, it might have insecure settings.
    *   **How FatFree Contributes:** FFF relies on PHP's built-in session management. If developers don't configure session settings properly, vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:**  Session cookies without the `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags, making them susceptible to client-side script access or transmission over insecure connections.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, session fixation, unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure Session Settings:**  Explicitly set secure session configurations in `php.ini` or using `ini_set()`:
            *   Enable `session.cookie_httponly = 1` to prevent JavaScript access to session cookies.
            *   Enable `session.cookie_secure = 1` to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
            *   Set a strong `session.cookie_lifetime`.
        *   **Regenerate Session IDs:** Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
        *   **Use Secure Session Storage:**  Consider using secure session storage mechanisms beyond the default file-based storage.

*   **Insecure Configuration Storage**
    *   **Description:** Storing sensitive configuration data insecurely can lead to its compromise.
    *   **How FatFree Contributes:** FFF's configuration mechanism, if not used carefully, can lead to sensitive data being stored in easily accessible files.
    *   **Example:**  Storing database credentials or API keys in plain text configuration files within the webroot.
    *   **Impact:** Full application compromise if database credentials or API keys are exposed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Store Sensitive Data Outside the Webroot:**  Keep configuration files containing sensitive information outside the publicly accessible web directory.
        *   **Use Environment Variables:**  Store sensitive configuration data in environment variables.
        *   **Encrypt Sensitive Configuration:**  Encrypt sensitive data within configuration files.
        *   **Restrict File Permissions:**  Ensure configuration files have appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
