## Focused Attack Tree: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise application using Fat-Free Framework vulnerabilities.

**Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Application (Critical Node)
    *   Exploit Fat-Free Framework Weaknesses (Critical Node)
        *   Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities (Latte) (Critical Node)
            *   Template Injection (High-Risk Path)
        *   Exploit Database Abstraction Layer (if used directly)
            *   Raw Query Injection (if using raw queries without proper sanitization) (High-Risk Path)
        *   Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (Critical Node)
            *   Access Sensitive Configuration Files (High-Risk Path)
        *   Exploit Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities (if using Fat-Free plugins) (Critical Node)
            *   Vulnerabilities in third-party plugins or extensions used with Fat-Free (High-Risk Path)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security, potentially leading to data theft, service disruption, or other severe consequences.

*   **Exploit Fat-Free Framework Weaknesses:** This node represents the entry point for attacks that specifically target vulnerabilities within the Fat-Free framework itself. Successfully exploiting this node allows the attacker to leverage framework-specific weaknesses to compromise the application.

*   **Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities (Latte):**  Fat-Free uses the Latte templating engine. This node is critical because vulnerabilities in the templating engine can directly lead to code execution on the server, a highly damaging outcome.

*   **Exploit Configuration Weaknesses:**  This node is critical because successful exploitation can reveal sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets. This information can then be used to launch further attacks and gain deeper access to the application and its resources.

*   **Exploit Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities (if using Fat-Free plugins):** This node highlights the risk associated with using external code within the application. Plugins and extensions, if vulnerable, can provide attackers with an easy entry point to compromise the application, as they often have direct access to application resources and functionalities.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Template Injection:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious code directly into template variables or template directives within Latte templates. If the application does not properly sanitize or escape data before rendering it in the template, the injected code will be executed by the server.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  Successful template injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the application and potentially the underlying server. This can result in data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.

*   **Raw Query Injection (if using raw queries without proper sanitization):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Fat-Free's database interaction methods to construct raw SQL queries directly from user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful SQL injection can allow the attacker to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even execute operating system commands on the database server.

*   **Access Sensitive Configuration Files:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to directly access configuration files (e.g., `.ini` files) that contain sensitive information. This can occur if these files are located within the web root and are not properly protected by web server configurations (like `.htaccess` rules or Nginx configurations).
    *   **Potential Impact:**  Successful access to configuration files can expose critical secrets such as database credentials, API keys, encryption keys, and other sensitive information. This information can then be used to launch further attacks, gain unauthorized access to databases or external services, and compromise the application more deeply.

*   **Vulnerabilities in third-party plugins or extensions used with Fat-Free:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party plugins or extensions that are integrated with the Fat-Free application. This often involves leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or discovering new ones through code analysis.
    *   **Potential Impact:** The impact of exploiting plugin vulnerabilities can vary widely depending on the functionality and privileges of the compromised plugin. It can range from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution and complete application takeover. Outdated or poorly maintained plugins are particularly susceptible to these types of attacks.
