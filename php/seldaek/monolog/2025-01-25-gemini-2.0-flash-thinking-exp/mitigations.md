## Mitigation Strategy: [Sensitive Data Sanitization using Monolog Processors](./mitigation_strategies/sensitive_data_sanitization_using_monolog_processors.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sensitive Data Sanitization with Monolog Processors
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Developers must identify sensitive data types logged by the application (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.).
    2.  **Create Monolog Processors:** Implement custom Monolog processors (or utilize existing ones if suitable) to sanitize sensitive data within log records *before* they are handled by handlers. Processors are functions that modify the log record array.
        *   **Example Processor:** Create a processor that checks for specific fields (e.g., 'password', 'apiKey') in the log record's `context` or `extra` data and replaces their values with masked placeholders like `********` or `[REDACTED]`. 
        *   **Regular Expression Processor:** For more complex sanitization, a processor could use regular expressions to identify and mask patterns resembling sensitive data within log messages themselves.
    3.  **Register Processors with Monolog Channels:** Register these sanitization processors with the relevant Monolog channels where sensitive data might be logged. This ensures that the processors are applied to log records in those specific channels.
    4.  **Test Processor Effectiveness:** Thoroughly test the implemented processors to ensure they effectively sanitize sensitive data in various logging scenarios and do not introduce unintended side effects.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Accidental logging of sensitive data in plain text, leading to potential breaches if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces information disclosure risk by actively sanitizing sensitive data *within the logging pipeline* using Monolog's processor mechanism.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. A basic password masking processor is registered globally in `config/packages/monolog.yaml`, but it's limited to specific field names and might not catch all instances of sensitive data.
*   **Missing Implementation:** More comprehensive processors are needed to handle various types of sensitive data and logging contexts. Processors should be registered more granularly with specific channels instead of globally to avoid unnecessary processing. Regular expression based processors for message body sanitization are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Parameterization via Monolog Context](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_parameterization_via_monolog_context.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Parameterization using Monolog Context
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Monolog Context:**  Consistently use Monolog's context arrays (parameterization) when constructing log messages, especially when incorporating dynamic data or user input. Avoid string concatenation to build log messages.
        *   **Example:** Instead of `logger->info('User login attempt failed for user ' . $username);`, use `logger->info('User login attempt failed for user {username}', ['username' => $username]);`.
    2.  **Validate Input Before Logging (Where Relevant):**  Perform basic input validation on data *before* including it in the Monolog context, especially if the data originates from user input or external sources. This helps prevent logging of unexpected or potentially malicious data.
    3.  **Context-Aware Formatting (If Displaying Logs):** If log messages are displayed in a user interface or other context where output escaping is necessary, leverage Monolog's formatters to apply context-aware escaping. While Monolog's primary purpose isn't output escaping for UI, formatters can be extended or customized to include basic escaping if needed for specific handler types that output to displayable formats.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents simple log injection attempts by using parameterization, which treats context values as data rather than code to be interpreted within the log message.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Logs (Low Severity, Context Dependent):**  Reduces the risk if logs are inadvertently displayed in a web context by encouraging safer data handling through parameterization and highlighting the potential need for output escaping (though formatters are not primarily for UI escaping).
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces log injection risks by promoting secure logging practices using Monolog's context feature.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Parameterization is used in newer modules, but older parts of the codebase still rely on string concatenation for log messages.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce consistent use of parameterization across the entire application codebase. Explore custom formatters for specific handlers if output escaping for display purposes becomes a requirement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Level Management in Monolog Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/log_level_management_in_monolog_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Log Level Management via Monolog Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment-Specific Log Levels in Monolog:** Configure different Monolog log levels for different environments (development, staging, production) directly within Monolog's configuration files (e.g., `monolog.yaml`).
        *   **Development:** Use more verbose levels like `DEBUG` or `INFO` to capture detailed information for debugging.
        *   **Production:** Use less verbose levels like `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL` to minimize log volume and focus on important events.
    2.  **Channel-Specific Log Levels:** Utilize Monolog's channel feature to configure different log levels for specific application components or modules. This allows for fine-grained control over logging verbosity. For example, set a more verbose level for a specific critical module while keeping the overall application log level less verbose.
    3.  **Regularly Review Log Levels:** Periodically review and adjust Monolog log level configurations to ensure they are appropriate for the current environment and monitoring needs. Avoid overly verbose logging in production that can lead to performance issues or excessive log storage.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Logging (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of DoS by controlling log volume, especially in production environments, preventing excessive resource consumption due to verbose logging.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):** Minimizes performance impact by reducing unnecessary logging in production, especially synchronous logging operations.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces DoS and performance risks by enabling efficient log volume management through Monolog's level configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Environment-specific log levels are set in `monolog.yaml` using environment variables. Production is set to `WARNING` level.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Channel-specific log levels are not extensively used to fine-tune logging verbosity for different application modules. Regular review of log level configurations is not formally scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Monolog Handler Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_monolog_handler_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Monolog Handler Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Appropriate Handlers:** Select Monolog handlers that are suitable for the application's security and performance requirements. Consider security implications of different handlers (e.g., network handlers, file handlers).
    2.  **Secure Handler Transports (For Network Handlers):** If using network-based handlers (e.g., `SyslogHandler`, `SocketHandler`, handlers for centralized logging systems), ensure secure transport protocols are used (e.g., TLS/SSL for network connections). Configure authentication and authorization if required by the logging destination.
    3.  **Restrict File Handler Permissions:** When using `StreamHandler` or `RotatingFileHandler`, ensure that the created log files and directories have appropriate file system permissions, restricting access as described in general log file access control best practices.
    4.  **Avoid Sensitive Information in Handler Configuration:**  Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords for logging services) directly in Monolog handler configurations. Use environment variables or secure configuration management to manage sensitive handler parameters.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Misconfigured handlers, especially network handlers, could potentially expose log data to unintended recipients if not securely configured.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Logging System (Medium Severity):** Insecurely configured handlers for external logging services could allow unauthorized access to the logging system itself if authentication is weak or missing.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces information disclosure and unauthorized access risks by promoting secure configuration of Monolog handlers and their transports.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. File handlers are used with basic file permissions. Network handlers are not currently in use.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal review of handler configurations for security best practices is not regularly performed. Secure transport and authentication are not configured for potential future network handlers. Sensitive information in handler configurations is not fully managed using secure methods.
