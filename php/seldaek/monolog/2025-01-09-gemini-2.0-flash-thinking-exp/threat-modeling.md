# Threat Model Analysis for seldaek/monolog

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Information](./threats/logging_sensitive_information.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal information, etc.) that is inadvertently logged by the application *using Monolog*. This happens when developers directly pass sensitive variables to Monolog's logging methods or include them in error messages that Monolog captures.

**Impact:**  Data breach, identity theft, unauthorized access to systems, compliance violations.

**Affected Monolog Component:**  `Logger` class, all built-in Handlers (e.g., `StreamHandler`, `SyslogHandler`, `RotatingFileHandler`). The core logging mechanism within Monolog is directly responsible for processing and outputting the logged data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict data handling policies *before* passing data to Monolog.
* Utilize Monolog's context feature and processors to sanitize or redact sensitive information before logging.
* Avoid logging raw exception details in production; log sanitized error messages instead.

## Threat: [Log Injection Attacks](./threats/log_injection_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious content into log messages by manipulating user input that is subsequently logged *by Monolog*. This injected content could exploit vulnerabilities in log analysis tools or other systems that process the logs, potentially leading to command injection or other malicious actions. Monolog's core functionality of recording provided strings makes it a direct participant in this threat.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution on systems processing logs, manipulation of log data, denial of service of logging infrastructure.

**Affected Monolog Component:** `Logger` class, `ProcessorInterface` implementations (if used to modify log records). Monolog's logging methods and any processors that alter the log record before it's written are directly involved.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize or escape any user-provided data *before* including it in log messages passed to Monolog.
* Avoid directly interpolating user input into log messages; use parameterized logging or context arrays with Monolog.

## Threat: [Exposure of Remote Logging Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_remote_logging_credentials.md)

**Description:** If Monolog is configured to log to remote services (e.g., syslog, cloud logging platforms) using specific handlers, the credentials used for authentication might be stored insecurely in the handler's configuration. An attacker gaining access to this configuration could compromise the remote logging system. This directly involves how Monolog's handlers manage authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to centralized logs, potential tampering or deletion of logs, compromise of the remote logging infrastructure.

**Affected Monolog Component:** Specific built-in Handlers that handle remote logging (e.g., `SyslogHandler`, `SocketHandler`, cloud provider specific handlers like `RavenHandler` or cloud logging SDK handlers). The credential handling within these specific Monolog handlers is the direct point of concern.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure Monolog's remote logging handlers to retrieve credentials from secure sources like environment variables or dedicated secrets management systems.
* Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in Monolog's configuration arrays.

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Handlers](./threats/malicious_custom_handlers.md)

**Description:** Developers might create custom handlers for Monolog (implementing `HandlerInterface`) that contain security vulnerabilities. If a vulnerable custom handler is used, it could be exploited to execute arbitrary code, leak data, or bypass security controls *within the context of the application using Monolog*.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, privilege escalation, denial of service.

**Affected Monolog Component:** Custom `HandlerInterface` implementations. The code within the custom handler, which extends Monolog's functionality, is the direct source of the threat.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure coding practices when developing custom Monolog handlers.
* Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom handlers.
* Restrict the ability to configure and load custom handlers to authorized personnel.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Handlers](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_handlers.md)

**Description:** If custom Monolog handlers involve deserializing data (e.g., from a queue or external source) without proper validation, they could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. An attacker could craft malicious serialized data that, when processed by the custom handler, leads to arbitrary code execution or other harmful actions *within the application using that Monolog handler*.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.

**Affected Monolog Component:** Custom `HandlerInterface` implementations that perform deserialization. The deserialization logic within the custom Monolog handler is the vulnerable component.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing untrusted data within custom Monolog handlers.
* If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization methods and carefully validate the input before deserialization within the custom handler's code.
