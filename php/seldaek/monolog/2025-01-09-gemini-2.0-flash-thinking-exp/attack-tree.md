## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Malicious Objectives (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_malicious_objectives__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successfully reaching this node means the attacker has compromised the application through vulnerabilities related to Monolog.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to the application or its data. It leverages vulnerabilities in how Monolog handles and stores sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sensitive Information in Logs (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sensitive_information_in_logs__critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights the risk of the application logging sensitive data. If this occurs, the logs become a valuable target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Log Files Containing Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/read_log_files_containing_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

This specific path details how an attacker can gain unauthorized access by reading log files that contain sensitive credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured File Permissions (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_file_permissions__critical_node_.md)

This critical node within the "Read Log Files Containing Credentials" path represents a common vulnerability where log files are stored with overly permissive access rights, allowing unauthorized users to read them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on the severe risk of an attacker being able to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application by exploiting Monolog's functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Log Injection leading to Command Injection (via Process Handler) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/log_injection_leading_to_command_injection__via_process_handler___critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights the danger of using Monolog's `ProcessHandler` without proper input sanitization. If an attacker can inject malicious commands into the logged data, and this data is used to construct the command executed by the handler, they can achieve remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands into Logged Data (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_into_logged_data__high-risk_path_.md)

This path describes the specific technique of injecting malicious commands into data that is subsequently logged and used by the `ProcessHandler`. This lack of sanitization is the core vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect Logs to Attacker-Controlled Destination (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_logs_to_attacker-controlled_destination__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the risk of an attacker manipulating Monolog's configuration to send log data to a server they control, enabling data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This critical node within the "Redirect Logs" path highlights vulnerabilities that allow attackers to modify Monolog's configuration, such as the file path for logging or the endpoint for an external service handler.

## Attack Tree Path: [Log Flooding (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/log_flooding__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents a denial-of-service attack where an attacker overwhelms the system by generating an excessive number of log entries, consuming resources like disk space and CPU.

## Attack Tree Path: [Generate Excessive Log Entries (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/generate_excessive_log_entries__critical_node_.md)

This critical node within the "Log Flooding" path describes the specific action of triggering events within the application that cause a large volume of log messages to be created.

## Attack Tree Path: [Fill Disk Space with Log Files (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/fill_disk_space_with_log_files__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents a denial-of-service attack where the attacker exploits the lack of proper log management to fill the server's disk space with log files, potentially crashing the application or the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Log Rotation or Size Limits (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_log_rotation_or_size_limits__critical_node_.md)

This critical node within the "Fill Disk Space" path highlights the vulnerability of not having proper log rotation policies or size limits in place, allowing an attacker to easily consume all available disk space.
