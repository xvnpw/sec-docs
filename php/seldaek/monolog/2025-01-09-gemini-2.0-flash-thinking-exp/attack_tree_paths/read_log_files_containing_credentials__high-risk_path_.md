# Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Read Log Files Containing Credentials (High-Risk Path)

"""
This analysis delves into the "Read Log Files Containing Credentials" attack path within an application
utilizing the 'monolog' library (https://github.com/seldaek/monolog). This path highlights how an attacker
can gain unauthorized access by reading log files that inadvertently contain sensitive credentials.
