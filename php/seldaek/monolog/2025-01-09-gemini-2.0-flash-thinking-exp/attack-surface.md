# Attack Surface Analysis for seldaek/monolog

## Attack Surface: [File Handler Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/file_handler_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the log file path configuration in Monolog's `StreamHandler` or similar file-writing handlers to write logs to arbitrary locations on the server.
*   **How Monolog Contributes:** Monolog's file handlers use the configured path directly. If this path is dynamically generated or based on external input without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a configuration parameter to set the log file path to `../../../../var/www/html/malicious.php`, potentially overwriting critical files or injecting malicious code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to code execution, data corruption, or denial of service.
    *   Information disclosure by writing logs to publicly accessible locations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamic generation of log file paths based on user input or external, untrusted sources.
    *   Use absolute paths for log files.
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of any configuration parameters related to file paths.
    *   Run the application with the least privileges necessary to write to the log directory.

## Attack Surface: [Database Handler Injection (NoSQL Injection)](./attack_surfaces/database_handler_injection__nosql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** When using database handlers (e.g., for MongoDB or CouchDB), attackers might be able to inject malicious commands or queries if log messages are directly inserted without proper sanitization.
*   **How Monolog Contributes:** Database handlers in Monolog can directly insert log data into the database. If the data includes unsanitized user input, it can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A log message containing user input like `{$gt: ''}` could be interpreted as a NoSQL query operator, potentially leading to data retrieval or manipulation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion in the logging database.
    *   Potential for further exploitation if the logging database is connected to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat log data as untrusted input when using database handlers.
    *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the database driver, even for logging.
    *   Sanitize or escape user-controlled data before logging it to the database.
    *   Restrict database user permissions used by the logging mechanism to the minimum necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Web Service Handler Abuse (API Key Exposure, Unauthorized Actions)](./attack_surfaces/web_service_handler_abuse__api_key_exposure__unauthorized_actions_.md)

*   **Description:** When using handlers that interact with external web services (e.g., Slack, IFTTT), insecure configuration or log content can lead to API key exposure or unintended actions on those services.
*   **How Monolog Contributes:** These handlers use configured API keys or tokens to interact with external services, and log messages might contain sensitive information.
*   **Example:**
    *   API keys for a Slack webhook are hardcoded in the Monolog configuration file.
    *   Sensitive data is included in a log message sent to a web service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of external service accounts and potential unauthorized actions.
    *   Exposure of sensitive data to third-party services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API keys and tokens securely (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management).
    *   Avoid including sensitive information in log messages sent to external services.
    *   Review the permissions granted to the API keys used by Monolog handlers.
    *   Consider using more secure authentication methods if available for the target web service.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Formatters/Processors](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_formattersprocessors.md)

*   **Description:** If custom formatters or processors are implemented without proper security considerations, they can introduce vulnerabilities like code execution if they process user-controlled data unsafely.
*   **How Monolog Contributes:** Monolog allows developers to create custom formatters and processors that can manipulate log data. If these custom components are not secure, they can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A custom formatter uses `eval()` on parts of the log message, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution on the server.
    *   Data breaches or manipulation.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test all custom formatters and processors for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Avoid using dangerous functions like `eval()` or `unserialize()` on untrusted data within custom components.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Monolog extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Storing Monolog configuration, including sensitive credentials for handlers (database passwords, API keys), in easily accessible files or environment variables without proper protection.
*   **How Monolog Contributes:** Monolog relies on configuration to function, and if this configuration is insecurely stored, it becomes an attack vector.
*   **Example:** Database credentials for a `DoctrineCouchDBHandler` are stored in plain text in a configuration file accessible via a web vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to further compromise of the application or connected systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store sensitive configuration details securely using environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted configuration files.
    *   Restrict access to configuration files and environment variables to authorized personnel and processes.
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials directly in the application code.
