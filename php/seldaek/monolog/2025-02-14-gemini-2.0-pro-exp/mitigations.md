# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for seldaek/monolog

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sensitive Data Masking/Sanitization (via Monolog Processors)](./mitigation_strategies/sensitive_data_maskingsanitization__via_monolog_processors_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Create a comprehensive list of all sensitive data types.
    2.  **Choose a Masking Approach:** Select redaction, partial masking, hashing, or tokenization.
    3.  **Implement Monolog Processors:** This is the core Monolog-specific step.
        *   **Custom Processor (Recommended):** Create a PHP class implementing `Monolog\Processor\ProcessorInterface`.  The `__invoke` method receives the log record (`$record`).  Within this method:
            *   Iterate through `$record['context']`. 
            *   Check keys against your sensitive data list.
            *   Apply masking to matching values.
            *   Modify `$record['message']` using regex or string replacements (be *very* careful with regex).
            *   Return the modified `$record`.  
        *   **`ReplaceProcessor` (Less Flexible):** Use `Monolog\Processor\ReplaceProcessor` with regex/replacement pairs for predictable patterns. *Less robust than a custom processor.*
        *   **`PsrLogMessageProcessor` (Supplementary):** Use *alongside* a custom or `ReplaceProcessor` to handle placeholders in the message string.
    4.  **Register the Processor:** Add the processor to your Monolog handler configuration in your application's logging setup.
    5.  **Testing:** Create unit tests specifically for the masking processor, covering various sensitive data patterns and edge cases.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (Severity: Critical):** Reduces exposure of sensitive data in compromised logs.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High):** Helps meet data protection regulations.
    *   **Reputational Damage (Severity: High):** Minimizes negative impact from data breaches.
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: Medium):** Reduces risk from malicious/negligent employees accessing logs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced (effectiveness depends on implementation thoroughness).
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Significantly reduces non-compliance risk.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Reduces likelihood and severity.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Reduces risk, but doesn't eliminate it.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially implemented. A basic `ReplaceProcessor` is used in `src/Logging/LogManager.php`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No comprehensive custom processor.
    *   No unit tests specifically for data masking.
    *   No documented list of sensitive data types.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Injection Prevention (via Monolog Usage and Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/log_injection_prevention__via_monolog_usage_and_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Structured Logging:** *Always* use the `$context` array in Monolog calls.  *Never* embed user-supplied data directly into the message string.
        ```php
        // BAD:
        $logger->info("User " . $userInput . " logged in.");

        // GOOD:
        $logger->info("User logged in.", ['username' => $userInput]);
        ```
    2.  **Message Size Limits (Handler Configuration):** Configure the Monolog *handler* to limit the maximum size of log messages.  This is often a handler-specific setting (e.g., `RotatingFileHandler`'s options). This is a direct Monolog configuration.
    3. **Escape special characters (within a custom Formatter, if necessary):** If you *absolutely must* include potentially unsafe data, and you're using a custom formatter, escape special characters within the formatter's `format` method. This is a last resort and should be avoided if possible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Forging (Severity: Medium):** Prevents injection of fake log entries.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents XSS if logs are viewed in a web interface (requires proper output encoding *in the viewer*, but using context helps).
    *   **Command Injection (Severity: Critical):** (Rare) Prevents command injection if logs are misused.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents overwhelming the system with huge log entries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Forging:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced (relies on secure log viewing).
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (part of a broader DoS strategy).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application mostly uses the `$context` array.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No specific message size limits are configured in Monolog handlers.
    *   Some older code might embed user input directly (needs audit).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handler-Specific Security Configuration (Direct Monolog Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/handler-specific_security_configuration__direct_monolog_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Handler Inventory:** List all Monolog handlers used.
    2.  **Security Review:** For *each* handler:
        *   Review Monolog's documentation for security options.
        *   Identify potential risks.
        *   Implement recommended security configurations *directly within the handler's setup*.
    3.  **Example: `SwiftMailerHandler`:**
        *   Ensure TLS/SSL is enabled *in the handler's configuration*.
        *   Use strong authentication *configured within the handler*.
    4.  **Example: Network Handlers (`SyslogUdpHandler`, `SocketHandler`):**
        *   Use TLS/SSL if possible (configured in the handler).
    5. **Avoid Risky Handlers:** Avoid handlers sending logs to insecure destinations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Handler-Specific Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable):** Addresses vulnerabilities in specific handlers.
    *   **Data Interception (Severity: High):** (For network handlers) Prevents interception in transit.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** (For network handlers) Prevents unauthorized access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Handler-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (depends on handler and configuration).
    *   **Data Interception:** Risk significantly reduced with TLS/SSL.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application uses `StreamHandler`, `RotatingFileHandler`, and `SwiftMailerHandler`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive review of all handler configurations hasn't been done.
    *   TLS/SSL for `SwiftMailerHandler` needs verification and explicit configuration *within the Monolog setup*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege Principle with Formatter (Custom Monolog Formatter)](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_principle_with_formatter__custom_monolog_formatter_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Necessary Information:** Determine the minimum information needed in logs.
    2.  **Choose/Create Formatter:**
        *   **Customize `LineFormatter`:** Use `$format` and `$dateFormat` to include *only* necessary fields. Remove unnecessary ones (e.g., full stack traces).
        *   **Custom Formatter (Recommended):** Create a class implementing `Monolog\Formatter\FormatterInterface`.  The `format` method receives the `$record` and returns a formatted string.  This provides full control.
    3.  **Configure Handler:** Assign the formatter to the Monolog handler in your application's logging configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Reduces information exposed in logs.
    *   **Data Breach (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the impact of a breach.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Data Breach:** Reduces scope and severity.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application uses the default `LineFormatter`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No custom formatters.
    *   Default `LineFormatter` likely includes too much information. Needs review and customization.
