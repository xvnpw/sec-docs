# Attack Surface Analysis for seldaek/monolog

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection/Forging (Due to Unsanitized Input)](./attack_surfaces/log_injectionforging__due_to_unsanitized_input_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious content or control characters into log messages, or forge entirely fake log entries, *by exploiting Monolog's handling of unsanitized input*.
*   **Monolog Contribution:** Monolog processes and formats log messages. If the application passes *unsanitized* user input *directly* to Monolog's formatting functions (e.g., `Logger::info($userInput)` without prior sanitization), Monolog will include that input in the output, including any malicious content. This is the *direct* involvement.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a username like `eviluser\n[ERROR] Fake error message` and the application logs this *directly* using `$logger->info("User logged in: " . $userInput);`.  Monolog formats and outputs the injected newline and fake error.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Misleading investigations.
    *   Triggering false alerts.
    *   Covering up malicious activity.
    *   Potential XSS vulnerabilities in log viewers (if the viewer doesn't properly escape output).
    *   Log file corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if logs are used for security monitoring or automated actions).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** *Always* sanitize and encode *all* user-supplied data *before* passing it to *any* Monolog function. Use a dedicated sanitization library or function. This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Use Monolog Formatters:** Leverage Monolog's built-in formatters (e.g., `LineFormatter`, `JsonFormatter`) to automatically escape special characters *as part of the formatting process*.  This provides a second layer of defense.
    *   **Contextual Escaping (Log Viewers):** If displaying logs in a web interface, ensure the *viewer* uses appropriate HTML escaping (this is *not* Monolog's direct responsibility, but is related).

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (File Handlers - Direct Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__file_handlers_-_direct_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the log file path to write logs to arbitrary locations on the file system, *due to a direct misconfiguration of Monolog's file handler*.
*   **Monolog Contribution:** Monolog's file-based handlers (e.g., `StreamHandler`, `RotatingFileHandler`) write logs to the file path *specified in their configuration*. If this configuration is vulnerable (e.g., allows user input to influence the path), Monolog will write to the attacker-controlled location. This is the *direct* involvement.
*   **Example:** The Monolog configuration is set up to use a file path that is *directly* constructed from user input, such as `new StreamHandler('/var/log/myapp/' . $_GET['log_file'] . '.log');`.  An attacker can then control the `log_file` parameter.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Overwriting critical system files.
    *   Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Use User Input for Paths:** The Monolog configuration *must not* use user input, environment variables that can be manipulated by the user, or any other externally controllable data to determine the log file path.
    *   **Hardcoded Paths:** Use hardcoded, absolute paths in the Monolog configuration, or paths relative to a strictly controlled base directory that is *not* user-configurable.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary file system permissions. The application should only have write access to the *pre-defined* log directory specified in the Monolog configuration.
    *   **Configuration Validation (Defense in Depth):** Implement validation checks *within the application* to ensure that the configured log path (even if hardcoded) is within expected boundaries. This is a defense-in-depth measure, as the primary mitigation is to avoid dynamic paths entirely.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding (Handler-Specific Resource Exhaustion)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_log_flooding__handler-specific_resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker causes excessive log generation, leading to resource exhaustion *specifically within a Monolog handler*.
*   **Monolog Contribution:** While the *trigger* for excessive logging is usually application logic, Monolog's handlers are responsible for the *output* of the logs.  If a handler is overwhelmed (e.g., a network handler cannot keep up with the volume), this is a direct Monolog-related issue.
*   **Example:** An attacker triggers rapid, repeated errors that are logged via a `SocketHandler`.  The network connection or the receiving server becomes saturated, preventing legitimate logs from being processed.  This is distinct from simply filling up disk space (which is often an application-level issue).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Log server unavailability.
    *   Loss of log data (specifically, logs that cannot be processed by the overwhelmed handler).
    *   Potential application instability if the handler's failure impacts the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Application Level):** The *primary* mitigation is to implement rate limiting *within the application logic* to prevent excessive log generation in the first place. This is the most effective approach.
    *   **Handler-Specific Buffering/Queuing (with Caution):** Some Monolog handlers might offer buffering or queuing mechanisms.  Use these *with caution*, as they can introduce complexity and potential data loss if the buffer/queue is overwhelmed.  They are *not* a substitute for application-level rate limiting.
    *   **Network Throttling/Firewalling (Network Handlers):** For network-based handlers, implement network-level throttling or firewall rules to limit incoming log traffic *to the logging server*. This protects the *server*, not the application itself.
    * **Handler Selection:** Choose handlers that are appropriate for the expected log volume and network conditions. For example, if high-volume logging is anticipated, a more robust handler (or a dedicated logging infrastructure) might be necessary.
