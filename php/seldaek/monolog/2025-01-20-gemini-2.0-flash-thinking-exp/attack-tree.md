## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Log Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_log_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code or data into log messages. This can occur when user-provided input, internal application data, or external data is logged without proper sanitization or escaping.
* **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    * **[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Payloads into Logs:**  Successfully injecting malicious payloads is the core of this attack path, enabling further exploitation during log processing.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Via User Input Logged Directly:** Logging user input without sanitization is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
    * **[CRITICAL] Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code via Log Processing:** This is the ultimate goal of many log injection attacks, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Log Processing:**
        * **Attack Vector:** If log processing involves deserializing log data (especially from untrusted sources), attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
        * **Impact:** Full system compromise through remote code execution.
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Exploit Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Log Processing:**
        * **Attack Vector:** If log processing involves executing system commands based on log content, attackers can inject malicious commands into the log data, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server.
        * **Impact:** Full system compromise through arbitrary command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Monolog Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_monolog_handlers.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Monolog's handlers process and output log data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit File Handler Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_file_handler_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Path Traversal to Write to Arbitrary Files:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the file path used by the `FileHandler` to write log data to arbitrary locations on the server.
            * **Critical Nodes within this sub-path:**
                * **[CRITICAL] Goal: Overwrite Configuration Files:** Overwriting configuration files can allow attackers to change application settings, potentially granting them administrative access or control.
                * **[CRITICAL] Goal: Write Malicious Code to Executable Locations:** Writing malicious code to web-accessible directories or other executable locations can lead to remote code execution.
                * **Impact:** Application takeover, remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Database Handler Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_database_handler_vulnerabilities.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK NODE] SQL Injection via Unsafe Queries (If Directly Constructing Queries):**
            * **Attack Vector:** If the database handler constructs SQL queries directly from log data without using parameterized queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
            * **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential database server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Monolog Formatters](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_monolog_formatters.md)

* **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Unsafe Serialization/Deserialization in Formatters:**
            * **Attack Vector:** If a formatter serializes log data and this data is later deserialized (either within the application or by an external system), attackers can exploit deserialization vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
            * **Impact:** Full system compromise through remote code execution.
