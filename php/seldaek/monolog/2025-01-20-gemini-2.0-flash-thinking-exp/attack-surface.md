# Attack Surface Analysis for seldaek/monolog

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Log Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_log_files.md)

- **Description:** Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal information) is unintentionally included in log messages.
- **How Monolog Contributes:** Monolog is the direct mechanism through which these log messages are created and written. If developers log variables or data structures containing sensitive information without proper filtering or redaction, Monolog will record this data.
- **Example:** A developer logs the entire request object, which includes user credentials in the authorization header, using `$logger->info('Request details', ['request' => $request]);`.
- **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to account compromise, data breaches, or compliance violations.
- **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Avoid logging sensitive data directly:** Do not log variables or objects that are known to contain sensitive information.
    - **Use Monolog Processors for Redaction:** Implement or utilize existing Monolog processors to filter out or mask sensitive data before it's logged.
    - **Review logging practices:** Regularly audit the codebase to identify and correct instances of sensitive data being logged.

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/log_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into log messages by manipulating input fields that are subsequently logged. This can lead to log tampering, forgery, or exploitation of log analysis tools.
- **How Monolog Contributes:** Monolog records the log messages as provided. If user-controlled input is directly included in log messages without sanitization, Monolog will record the injected malicious content.
- **Example:** A user provides a malicious string containing control characters or escape sequences in a form field. This string is then logged using `$logger->warning('User input: ' . $_POST['comment']);`. This could potentially break log parsers or allow for log forgery.
- **Impact:** Obfuscation of malicious activity, misleading security investigations, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in log analysis tools.
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Sanitize user input before logging:** Encode or escape user-provided data before including it in log messages.
    - **Use parameterized logging:** Utilize Monolog's context parameters instead of directly concatenating strings, which can help prevent some forms of injection. For example: `$logger->warning('User input: {comment}', ['comment' => $_POST['comment']]);`
    - **Validate input:** Implement robust input validation to prevent the submission of potentially malicious strings.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Log File Storage and Access (Configuration-Related)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_log_file_storage_and_access__configuration-related_.md)

- **Description:** Log files are stored in locations with overly permissive access controls due to how the Monolog file handler is configured.
- **How Monolog Contributes:** Monolog's file handlers (e.g., `StreamHandler`) write log files to the specified location. The developer's configuration of the handler directly determines where the files are created, which influences the default permissions. Incorrect configuration can lead to insecure storage.
- **Example:** A developer configures the `StreamHandler` to write logs to a publicly accessible directory on the web server.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information contained in logs, potential tampering with log data to hide malicious activity.
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Store log files in secure locations:** Ensure the Monolog file handler is configured to write log files to directories that are not publicly accessible.
    - **Configure file permissions appropriately (external to Monolog, but related to its configuration):** While Monolog doesn't directly set permissions, ensure the directories where Monolog writes logs have restricted access permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Specific Monolog Handlers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_specific_monolog_handlers.md)

- **Description:** Certain Monolog handlers interact with external systems (e.g., databases, email servers, remote logging services). Vulnerabilities in the implementation of these handlers could be exploited.
- **How Monolog Contributes:** Monolog provides these handlers as a way to output logs to various destinations. If a handler has a bug or doesn't properly sanitize data before sending it to an external system, it can introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Example:** A poorly implemented database handler might be susceptible to SQL injection if log data is directly inserted into a database without proper escaping.
- **Impact:** Compromise of external systems, data breaches, unauthorized actions.
- **Risk Severity:** **High**
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Use well-maintained and reputable handlers:** Stick to core Monolog handlers or those from trusted sources.
    - **Keep Monolog and its dependencies updated:** Regularly update Monolog to patch known vulnerabilities in handlers.
    - **Securely configure handlers:** Provide necessary credentials and configurations securely, avoiding hardcoding sensitive information.
    - **Review the code of custom handlers:** If using custom handlers, ensure they are thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
