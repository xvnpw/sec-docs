# Threat Model Analysis for seldaek/monolog

## Threat: [Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

* **Description:** Developers may inadvertently log sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data, session tokens) within log messages. Monolog, by its nature, captures and persists this data, making it accessible if logs are compromised. This directly involves Monolog's core function of recording log messages.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential data loss, reputational damage, compliance violations.
    * **Affected Monolog Component:**
        * **Loggers:** The core component where log messages are initially created.
        * **Processors:** If processors don't sanitize data, sensitive information remains.
        * **Formatters:** Components that format the log record into a string, presenting the sensitive data.
        * **Handlers:** All handlers are affected as they are the destination where the sensitive data is written.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Code Reviews:** Implement thorough code reviews to identify and prevent the logging of sensitive data.
        * **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize or redact sensitive data before logging. Implement custom processors to automatically remove or mask sensitive information.
        * **Avoid Logging Raw Input:** Be cautious about logging raw user input or data received from external systems without proper filtering.
        * **Use Specific Log Levels:** Utilize appropriate log levels and avoid logging sensitive details at lower, more verbose levels in production environments.
        * **Secure Log Storage:** Ensure log files and destinations are securely stored with appropriate access controls.

## Threat: [Exposure through Insecure Log Destinations](./threats/exposure_through_insecure_log_destinations.md)

* **Description:** If Monolog handlers are configured to send logs to insecure destinations (e.g., publicly accessible file shares, unencrypted network services, misconfigured third-party logging services), attackers could gain unauthorized access to the log data. This directly involves Monolog's handler functionality and configuration.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential data loss, reputational damage.
    * **Affected Monolog Component:**
        * **Handlers:** Specifically the handlers that are responsible for sending logs to external destinations (e.g., `StreamHandler`, `SyslogHandler`, third-party service handlers).
        * **Configuration:** The configuration of the handlers determines the destination and security settings.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Log Storage:** Ensure log files are stored in secure locations with appropriate access controls (e.g., restricted file system permissions).
        * **Encrypt Log Transmission:** Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) when sending logs over the network to remote destinations.
        * **Secure Third-Party Services:** Carefully evaluate and configure third-party logging services, ensuring they have adequate security measures in place. Use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        * **Regularly Review Configuration:** Periodically review Monolog's handler configurations to ensure they are still secure and appropriate.
