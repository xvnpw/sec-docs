# Threat Model Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Threat: [Unauthorized Component Status Update via API](./threats/unauthorized_component_status_update_via_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability or misconfiguration in the Cachet API (e.g., weak authentication, lack of authorization checks) to directly send requests to update the status of components. They might set critical components to "Operational" when they are down, or vice versa, to mislead users or cause panic.

**Impact:** Misleading status information can erode user trust, cause users to take incorrect actions (e.g., assuming a service is available when it's not), and hinder proper incident response.

**Affected Component:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ComponentController.php` (API endpoints for updating component status, likely `update` method), potentially authentication middleware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) for all API endpoints.
*   Enforce strict authorization checks to ensure only authorized users or systems can update component statuses.
*   Regularly review and audit API access controls.
*   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks or excessive requests.

## Threat: [Tampering with Existing Incident Reports via API](./threats/tampering_with_existing_incident_reports_via_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cachet API and modifies existing incident reports. They might alter the severity, status, message, or even delete legitimate reports, hindering communication and transparency.

**Impact:** Misrepresenting the status of incidents, hiding critical information from users, and potentially disrupting incident management processes.

**Affected Component:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/IncidentController.php` (API endpoints for updating and deleting incidents, likely `update` and `destroy` methods), potentially authorization middleware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization controls for API endpoints that modify incident reports.
*   Implement audit logging to track changes made to incident reports, allowing for detection of unauthorized modifications.
*   Consider implementing version control or backups for incident reports.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Incident Reports or Component Names](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_incident_reports_or_component_names.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into incident report titles, messages, or component names. When other users view these elements on the status page, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Impact:** Compromising user accounts, stealing sensitive information, and damaging user trust in the status page and the underlying service.

**Affected Component:**  Views rendering incident reports (`resources/views/dashboard/incidents/*`, `resources/views/partials/incidents/*`), views rendering component information (`resources/views/dashboard/components/*`, `resources/views/partials/components/*`), potentially input handling logic in controllers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-supplied data displayed on the status page.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.
*   Regularly audit the codebase for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Default Credentials or Weak Administrative Passwords](./threats/default_credentials_or_weak_administrative_passwords.md)

**Description:** The Cachet instance is deployed with default administrative credentials or easily guessable passwords, allowing attackers to gain full control over the status page.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Cachet instance, allowing attackers to manipulate all aspects of the status page, including component statuses, incidents, and settings.

**Affected Component:** Authentication system, potentially initial setup scripts or configuration files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Force users to change default administrative credentials during the initial setup process.
*   Enforce strong password policies for all administrative accounts.
*   Regularly review and update administrative passwords.
