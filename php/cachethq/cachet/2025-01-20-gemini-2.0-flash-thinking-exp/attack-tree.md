## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Cachet Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE - Gaining Admin Access)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_cachet_authenticationauthorization_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_gaining_512bdfcf.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Utilize Default/Weak Credentials to Login:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical (Full administrative access)
    * **Effort:** Minimal
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (multiple failed attempts can be detected)
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Gain Unauthorized Administrative Access to Cachet:** Represents the successful compromise of Cachet's administrative interface, granting the attacker full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Cachet API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_cachet_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Inject Malicious Payloads (e.g., Command Injection, SSRF) via API Input Validation Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical (Command Injection - full server compromise), Significant (SSRF - potential access to internal resources)
    * **Effort:** Moderate
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (Command Injection), Moderate (SSRF)
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Inject Malicious Payloads (e.g., Command Injection...):** This node represents the point where the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the Cachet server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cachet's Data Handling and Storage Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cachet's_data_handling_and_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Access Sensitive Information Stored by Cachet (due to Insecure Data Storage Practices):**
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Critical (Exposure of sensitive data like credentials)
    * **Effort:** Moderate
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (requires access to the server/filesystem)
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Access Sensitive Information Stored by Cachet:** Represents the successful exfiltration of sensitive data stored by Cachet.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Cachet's Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_cachet's_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies to Compromise Cachet:**
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical (Full server compromise)
    * **Effort:** Moderate
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies to Compromise Cachet:** This node signifies the attacker gaining control of the Cachet server by exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Cachet's Functionality to Mislead Users/Application](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_cachet's_functionality_to_mislead_usersapplication.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Falsely Report Incidents or Change Component Statuses (after Gaining Unauthorized Access):**
    * **Likelihood:** High (if unauthorized access is achieved)
    * **Impact:** Moderate (loss of trust, potential for incorrect automated responses)
    * **Effort:** Minimal
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Gain Unauthorized Access to Cachet (via previous attack vectors):** This is a prerequisite critical node, as the ability to manipulate functionality relies on first gaining unauthorized access through other means.
