# Attack Surface Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Attack Surface: [API Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify unintended model attributes by sending extra parameters in API requests.
    *   **How Cachet Contributes:** If Cachet's API endpoints for creating or updating resources (e.g., incidents, components) do not explicitly define which attributes are fillable or guarded, attackers can potentially modify sensitive fields. This is a direct consequence of how Cachet's API is designed and implemented.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a request to update a component, including a parameter like `is_admin=true`, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges if the `is_admin` attribute is not properly protected in Cachet's model definition.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access to features or data within the Cachet application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicitly Define Fillable/Guarded Attributes:** In Cachet's backend code (likely Laravel models), explicitly define the `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties for each model to control which attributes can be mass-assigned via Cachet's API.
        *   **Input Validation and Whitelisting:** Implement strict input validation within Cachet's API request handling to only process expected parameters.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure Cachet's API endpoints only allow modification of the necessary attributes for the intended operation.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via___env__file.md)

*   **Description:** The `.env` file, containing sensitive configuration details, is accessible via the web server.
    *   **How Cachet Contributes:** Cachet, being a PHP application, relies on a `.env` file to store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and application secrets. While the web server configuration is the primary control, Cachet's reliance on this file format makes it a direct concern for its security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses `/.env` or a similar path on the Cachet instance and retrieves the database credentials used by Cachet.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Cachet application and potentially the underlying infrastructure due to exposed credentials and secrets used by Cachet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Web Server Configuration:** Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) hosting Cachet to explicitly deny access to the `.env` file. This is a crucial step in securing Cachet deployments.
        *   **Move Sensitive Configuration (Advanced):** Consider using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution instead of relying solely on the `.env` file for Cachet's configuration.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit the web server configuration hosting Cachet to ensure proper file access restrictions are in place.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of User-Uploaded Assets (if implemented by Cachet)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_user-uploaded_assets__if_implemented_by_cachet_.md)

*   **Description:** If Cachet allows users to upload files (e.g., for branding or incident attachments), these files are not handled securely.
    *   **How Cachet Contributes:** If Cachet's codebase includes file upload functionality without proper security measures, it directly introduces risks. This is specific to how Cachet's developers implemented this feature.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image through a Cachet upload form. If the web server executes PHP files in the upload directory configured for Cachet, the attacker can gain remote code execution on the Cachet server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Cachet server, defacement of the Cachet instance, malware distribution through the Cachet platform.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dedicated Storage:** Store files uploaded through Cachet in a location outside the web server's document root serving Cachet.
        *   **Content-Type Validation:** Validate the file's content type based on its magic number, not just the extension, within Cachet's upload handling logic.
        *   **File Name Sanitization:** Sanitize uploaded file names within Cachet to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   **Disable Script Execution:** Configure the web server serving Cachet to prevent the execution of scripts in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` or server configuration).
        *   **Virus Scanning:** Implement virus scanning on files uploaded through Cachet.
