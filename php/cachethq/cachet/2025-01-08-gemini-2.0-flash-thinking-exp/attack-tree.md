## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Cachet Admin Panel -> Exploit Authentication Weaknesses -> Default Credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cachet_vulnerabilities_-_gain_unauthorized_access_to_cachet_admin_panel_-_exploit_authentica_12754c57.md)

*   **Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Cachet Admin Panel -> Exploit Authentication Weaknesses -> Default Credentials (if not changed) -> Access Admin Panel with Default Credentials:** This is a high-risk path due to the high likelihood of default credentials not being changed and the critical impact of gaining admin access. It requires very low effort and skill, making it an easy target for even novice attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Cachet Admin Panel -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Cachet's Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cachet_vulnerabilities_-_gain_unauthorized_access_to_cachet_admin_panel_-_exploit_known_vuln_1769c29d.md)

*   **Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Cachet Admin Panel -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Cachet's Authentication -> Leverage Publicly Disclosed Authentication Exploits:** This path is high-risk because publicly known exploits are readily available, making it easier for attackers to gain admin access if the Cachet instance is not up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Manipulate Status Data -> Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if enabled and exposed) -> Unauthorized API Access](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cachet_vulnerabilities_-_manipulate_status_data_-_exploit_api_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_an_b09dc0ab.md)

*   **Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Manipulate Status Data -> Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if enabled and exposed) -> Unauthorized API Access -> Exploit Missing or Weak API Authentication:** This path is high-risk if the API is exposed without proper authentication. It allows attackers to directly manipulate status data, leading to misinformation and potential disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Manipulate Status Data -> Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if enabled and exposed) -> API Injection Attacks (e.g., Command Injection via API parameters)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cachet_vulnerabilities_-_manipulate_status_data_-_exploit_api_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_an_27d0b75d.md)

*   **Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Manipulate Status Data -> Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if enabled and exposed) -> API Injection Attacks (e.g., Command Injection via API parameters) -> Inject Malicious Commands via API Calls:** While potentially lower likelihood, the impact of command injection is critical, allowing for remote code execution. This makes it a high-risk path despite requiring more skill.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Manipulate Status Data -> Exploit Web Interface Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) -> Stored XSS via Incident or Component Names/Messages](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cachet_vulnerabilities_-_manipulate_status_data_-_exploit_web_interface_vulnerabilities_-_cr_31dd01d4.md)

*   **Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Manipulate Status Data -> Exploit Web Interface Vulnerabilities -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) -> Stored XSS via Incident or Component Names/Messages -> Inject Malicious Scripts that Execute in Admin/User Browsers:** Stored XSS has a high impact as the malicious script can affect multiple users over time, potentially leading to session hijacking or further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities -> Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Cachet's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cachet_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_dependencies_vulnerabilities_-_leverage_known_vulnerabiliti_560f7151.md)

*   **Exploit Cachet Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Dependencies Vulnerabilities -> Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Cachet's Dependencies -> Gain Access or Execute Code via Vulnerable Libraries:** This path is high-risk because vulnerabilities in dependencies are common and can have a critical impact if exploited, potentially leading to full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Misinformation/Deception -> Manipulate Status to Cause Misleading Information -> Report False Incidents / Mark Healthy Components as Down / Hide Real Incidents](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_misinformationdeception_-_manipulate_status_to_cause_misleading_information_-_report_false__ae874b8d.md)

*   **Leverage Misinformation/Deception -> Manipulate Status to Cause Misleading Information -> Report False Incidents / Mark Healthy Components as Down / Hide Real Incidents:** While not a direct technical exploit of Cachet's code, this path represents a significant risk as it can directly impact users and their trust in the application. It's often enabled by compromised admin credentials (following other high-risk paths).
