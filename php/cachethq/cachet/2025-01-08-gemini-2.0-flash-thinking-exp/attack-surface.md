# Attack Surface Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Administrative Interface](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_administrative_interface.md)

**Description:** The administrative interface, if exposed without proper authentication or network restrictions, allows unauthorized access to manage the entire Cachet instance.

**How Cachet Contributes:** Cachet provides a web-based administrative panel for managing components, incidents, users, and settings. If this panel is accessible without strong authentication or from the public internet, it becomes a direct target.

**Example:** An attacker finds the `/admin` route of a Cachet instance publicly accessible without requiring login. They can then create new administrators, modify component statuses, or even delete the entire instance.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Cachet instance, leading to data manipulation, service disruption, and potential misinformation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Ensure the administrative interface is protected by robust authentication mechanisms (strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
*   **Users:** Restrict access to the administrative interface to trusted networks or IP addresses using firewall rules or web server configurations. Consider using a VPN for accessing the admin panel.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Incident Messages and Component Names](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_incident_messages_and_component_names.md)

**Description:**  Cachet displays user-generated content like incident updates, component names, and metric descriptions. If these are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users viewing the status page.

**How Cachet Contributes:** Cachet allows administrators to input free-form text for incidents, components, and metrics. If the application doesn't properly escape or sanitize this input before rendering it on the frontend, it's vulnerable to XSS.

**Example:** An attacker creates an incident with a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When users view this incident on the status page, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the status page.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust output encoding (HTML escaping) for all user-supplied data displayed on the status page and within the admin interface. Use a templating engine that provides automatic escaping by default.
*   **Developers:** Consider Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Exposure and Abuse](./attack_surfaces/api_key_exposure_and_abuse.md)

**Description:** Cachet's API allows programmatic interaction. Compromise of API keys grants attackers the ability to perform actions as an authorized user.

**How Cachet Contributes:** Cachet relies on API keys for authentication to its API. If these keys are exposed (e.g., in client-side code, insecure storage, or through network interception), attackers can use them to manage incidents, components, and metrics.

**Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds this key and uses it to mark all components as operational, creating a false sense of security.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of Cachet data, including creating false incidents, hiding real issues, or disrupting the status page's accuracy.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**  Implement secure storage for API keys (e.g., hashed and salted in the database for backend usage). Encourage users to treat API keys as sensitive credentials.
*   **Users:**  Store API keys securely and avoid embedding them directly in client-side code. Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management for storing and accessing API keys. Implement API key rotation policies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Password Reset Functionality](./attack_surfaces/insecure_password_reset_functionality.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the password reset process can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**How Cachet Contributes:** Cachet has a password reset mechanism. If this mechanism is not implemented securely, it can be exploited.

**Example:** The password reset process uses predictable reset tokens, allowing an attacker to guess a valid token and reset another user's password.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially including administrator accounts, leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Use cryptographically secure, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens. Implement account lockout after multiple failed reset attempts. Send password reset links over HTTPS.
*   **Users:**  Educate users about the importance of strong passwords and the risks of clicking on suspicious password reset links.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If Cachet constructs SQL queries using unsanitized user input, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.

**How Cachet Contributes:** Cachet interacts with a database to store its data. If the application doesn't properly sanitize user inputs used in database queries, it is susceptible to SQL injection.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input in a search field that, when processed by Cachet, executes arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive data or modify database records.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential denial of service by corrupting the database.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. This prevents user input from being interpreted as SQL code. Employ an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that handles input sanitization. Perform input validation on the server-side.
