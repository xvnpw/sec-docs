# Threat Model Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Threat: [Unauthorized Component Status Update](./threats/unauthorized_component_status_update.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit a vulnerability in the API authentication or authorization *within Cachet* to directly call the API endpoints responsible for updating component statuses. Alternatively, if the Cachet web interface is vulnerable to session hijacking or CSRF, an attacker could manipulate a logged-in administrator's session to change component statuses.

**Impact:** Misleads users about the actual system health, potentially causing panic if healthy components are marked as down, or masking real outages if failing components are marked as operational. This can lead to delayed incident response and customer dissatisfaction.

**Affected Component:** API endpoints (`/api/v1/components/{id}` with PUT method), `ComponentsController` (or equivalent backend logic handling status updates).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all Cachet API endpoints.
*   Enforce proper input validation and sanitization on status updates within Cachet's codebase.
*   Implement CSRF protection for the Cachet web interface.
*   Regularly audit Cachet's API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Incident Creation/Modification/Deletion](./threats/unauthorized_incident_creationmodificationdeletion.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the Cachet API or web interface authentication/authorization to create false incidents, modify existing ones with misleading information, or delete genuine incident reports. This could involve direct API calls or exploiting web application vulnerabilities *within Cachet*.

**Impact:** Spreads misinformation, causes unnecessary alarm or downplays critical issues. Deletion of incidents hinders post-mortem analysis and learning from past events.

**Affected Component:** API endpoints (`/api/v1/incidents`), `IncidentsController` (or equivalent backend logic for incident management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization for Cachet's incident management functionalities.
*   Enforce proper input validation and sanitization on incident creation and updates within Cachet to prevent injection attacks.
*   Implement audit logging for all incident modifications and deletions within Cachet.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Content in Incident Updates](./threats/injection_of_malicious_content_in_incident_updates.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit a lack of input sanitization in the Cachet incident update fields (e.g., title, message) to inject malicious scripts (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) or harmful links. This could be done through the Cachet web interface or the API.

**Impact:** Users viewing the status page could be targeted by phishing attacks, malware downloads, or other malicious activities if the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Affected Component:** `IncidentsController` (or equivalent backend logic handling incident data), template rendering engine used by Cachet to display incident details.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and output encoding/escaping for all user-provided content in Cachet's incident updates.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities within the Cachet application.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Subscriber List](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_subscriber_list.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities *within Cachet* to gain unauthorized access to the database or configuration files where subscriber information (email addresses, etc.) is stored. This could be through SQL injection (if Cachet uses direct SQL queries and is vulnerable), file inclusion vulnerabilities *within Cachet*, or by exploiting insecure file handling in Cachet.

**Impact:** Privacy breach, potential for targeted phishing campaigns or spam directed at subscribers.

**Affected Component:** Database storing subscriber information accessed by Cachet, potentially configuration files accessed by Cachet if connection details are exposed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure secure database interaction practices within Cachet (e.g., parameterized queries or ORM).
*   Securely store database credentials and other sensitive information used by Cachet.
*   Implement proper access controls within Cachet to prevent unauthorized file access.

## Threat: [Lack of Proper API Authentication/Authorization](./threats/lack_of_proper_api_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Description:** If the Cachet API lacks proper authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) or has weak authorization controls *within its own implementation*, attackers can gain unauthorized access to manage components, incidents, and subscribers.

**Impact:** Enables all the threats listed above related to data manipulation and access.

**Affected Component:** All API endpoints (`/api/v1/*`) implemented by Cachet.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication for all Cachet API endpoints (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
*   Implement granular authorization controls within Cachet to restrict access based on user roles or permissions.
*   Enforce HTTPS for all communication with the Cachet API.

## Threat: [API Key Exposure](./threats/api_key_exposure.md)

**Description:** API keys used for authentication with the Cachet API might be inadvertently exposed in client-side code interacting with Cachet, version control systems containing Cachet configurations, or configuration files used by Cachet.

**Impact:** Allows unauthorized access to the Cachet API, enabling malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** Potentially any component within or interacting with Cachet where API keys are used or stored, configuration files used by Cachet, client-side JavaScript (if applicable).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management) within the Cachet deployment.
*   Avoid embedding API keys directly in client-side code interacting with Cachet.
*   Regularly rotate API keys used by and for the Cachet API.
