# Deep Analysis of Cachet Attack Tree Path: Inefficient Database Queries

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the attack path "1.1.1 Craft requests that trigger complex joins or full table scans on large datasets" within the Cachet application, identify specific vulnerabilities, assess the risk, and propose concrete mitigation strategies beyond the high-level suggestions already provided.  This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for the development team to enhance Cachet's resilience against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks stemming from database query inefficiencies.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target Application:** Cachet (https://github.com/cachethq/cachet)
*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation of inefficient database queries through crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Specific Attack Path:** 1.1.1 (Crafting requests that trigger complex joins or full table scans).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or significant performance degradation.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection *except* as it relates to triggering inefficient queries).  It also does not cover infrastructure-level DoS attacks (e.g., network flooding).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Cachet source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to identify:
    *   Database models and relationships (particularly those involving incidents, metrics, and related data).
    *   API endpoints and controller logic that handle requests interacting with these models.
    *   Database query construction and execution (using Eloquent ORM and raw SQL, if present).
    *   Existing indexing strategies.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Simulated):**  Since we don't have a live, populated Cachet instance, we will *simulate* dynamic analysis by:
    *   Hypothesizing potentially problematic request parameters based on code review.
    *   Reasoning about the likely database query execution plan for these requests.
    *   Identifying potential bottlenecks (e.g., missing indexes, inefficient joins).

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Based on the code review and simulated dynamic analysis, we will:
    *   Refine the risk assessment (likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, detection difficulty).
    *   Identify specific attack scenarios.

4.  **Mitigation Recommendation Refinement:**  We will expand on the initial mitigation suggestions, providing more specific and actionable recommendations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1

### 4.1 Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - based on common Cachet patterns)

Let's assume, based on common Cachet usage and database design principles, the following:

*   **Key Models:**
    *   `Incident`: Stores information about service incidents (name, description, status, timestamps, etc.).
    *   `IncidentUpdate`: Stores updates related to an incident (status changes, messages, timestamps).  Has a foreign key to `Incident`.
    *   `Metric`: Stores definitions of metrics (name, description, calculation method).
    *   `MetricPoint`: Stores data points for a metric (value, timestamp). Has a foreign key to `Metric`.
    *   `Component`: Stores information about system components.
    *   `ComponentGroup`: Groups components together.
    *   `Subscriber`: Stores information about subscribers.

*   **Likely Relationships:**
    *   One-to-many: `Incident` to `IncidentUpdate`.
    *   One-to-many: `Metric` to `MetricPoint`.
    *   One-to-many: `Component` to `Incident` (an incident can be linked to a component).
    *   One-to-many: `ComponentGroup` to `Component`.
    *   Many-to-many: `Subscriber` to `Component` (subscribers can subscribe to components).

*   **Potential Problem Areas (Hypothetical, requiring verification against actual code):**

    *   **API Endpoint: `/api/v1/incidents` (GET):**  Fetching all incidents.
        *   **Potential Issue:**  If no pagination or filtering is applied, and the `Incident` table is large, this could result in a full table scan.  Fetching related `IncidentUpdate` data (e.g., using Eloquent's `with('updates')`) could exacerbate the problem with inefficient joins.
        *   **Vulnerable Code Example (Hypothetical):**
            ```php
            // app/Http/Controllers/Api/IncidentController.php
            public function index() {
                $incidents = Incident::with('updates')->get(); // Potentially very inefficient
                return response()->json($incidents);
            }
            ```

    *   **API Endpoint: `/api/v1/metrics/{id}/points` (GET):** Fetching metric points.
        *   **Potential Issue:**  Fetching a large number of metric points without proper date range filtering or pagination could lead to a full table scan on the `MetricPoint` table, which can grow very large.
        *   **Vulnerable Code Example (Hypothetical):**
            ```php
            // app/Http/Controllers/Api/MetricController.php
            public function points(Metric $metric) {
                $points = $metric->points()->get(); // No filtering or pagination
                return response()->json($points);
            }
            ```
    * **Dashboard/Reporting Features:** Any internal dashboard or reporting features that aggregate data across multiple tables without proper indexing or query optimization could be vulnerable.  For example, a report showing "all incidents and their associated component status changes over the past year" could be extremely slow if not carefully designed.

    * **Search Functionality:** If Cachet has a search feature that allows searching across incident descriptions, metric names, or other text fields, a poorly implemented search (e.g., using `LIKE '%search_term%'` without full-text indexing) could trigger full table scans.

    * **Subscriber Notifications:** The logic that determines which subscribers to notify about an incident could be inefficient if it involves complex joins or filtering across the `Subscriber`, `Component`, and `Incident` tables.

### 4.2 Simulated Dynamic Analysis

Based on the hypothetical code review, we can simulate the following attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Incident Flood:**
    *   **Attacker Request:** Repeatedly call `/api/v1/incidents` with no parameters, or with parameters designed to maximize the data returned (e.g., requesting all related updates).
    *   **Expected Database Behavior:** Full table scan on `Incident`, potentially inefficient joins with `IncidentUpdate`.  If the `Incident` table has thousands of entries, this will consume significant database resources.
    *   **Impact:** Slowdown or complete outage of the Cachet API and web interface.

*   **Scenario 2: Metric Point Overload:**
    *   **Attacker Request:** Repeatedly call `/api/v1/metrics/{id}/points` with a valid metric ID but no date range filters, or with a very wide date range.
    *   **Expected Database Behavior:** Full table scan on `MetricPoint` for the given metric.  If the metric has a high data point frequency and a long history, this table could be extremely large.
    *   **Impact:** Slowdown or outage, particularly affecting metric-related functionality.

*   **Scenario 3: Complex Report Generation:**
    *   **Attacker Request:**  If Cachet has a reporting feature, repeatedly request a complex report that involves joining multiple large tables (e.g., incidents, updates, components, metrics) over a long time period.
    *   **Expected Database Behavior:**  Complex joins and aggregations without proper indexing, leading to very slow query execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Slowdown or outage of the reporting feature, potentially affecting the entire application.

### 4.3 Threat Modeling Refinement

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  The likelihood depends on the actual implementation of the API endpoints and the presence of pagination, filtering, and indexing.  Given the potential for large datasets in a status page application, the likelihood of encountering performance issues is significant.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful exploitation can lead to a complete denial of service, rendering the status page unavailable.
*   **Effort:** Medium.  The attacker needs to understand the API structure and potentially the database schema, but this information is often readily available or can be inferred.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.  Requires basic knowledge of database queries and API interactions.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  The attack may initially manifest as general performance degradation, making it difficult to distinguish from legitimate high load.  Database monitoring tools can help, but require proper configuration and interpretation.

### 4.4 Mitigation Recommendation Refinement

The initial mitigations were good starting points. Here's a more detailed and actionable breakdown:

1.  **Database Query Optimization (Specific Actions):**

    *   **Pagination:**  Implement pagination *on all API endpoints* that return lists of data (incidents, metric points, etc.).  Use a consistent pagination approach (e.g., limit/offset or cursor-based pagination).  *Enforce a maximum page size* to prevent attackers from requesting excessively large pages.
        *   **Example (Laravel Eloquent):**
            ```php
            $incidents = Incident::with('updates')->paginate(25); // Limit to 25 per page
            ```
    *   **Filtering:**  Provide and *enforce* filtering options on API endpoints.  Allow filtering by date range, status, component, etc.  Ensure that filters are applied *before* fetching related data.
        *   **Example:**
            ```php
            $incidents = Incident::with('updates')
                ->where('created_at', '>=', $startDate)
                ->where('created_at', '<=', $endDate)
                ->where('status', $status)
                ->paginate(25);
            ```
    *   **Eager Loading Control:**  Carefully manage eager loading of relationships (e.g., `with('updates')`).  Avoid loading unnecessary relationships.  Consider using lazy loading or selective eager loading based on request parameters.
    *   **Query Builder:**  Use Laravel's query builder to construct efficient queries.  Avoid raw SQL unless absolutely necessary, and if used, ensure it's properly parameterized and optimized.
    *   **Avoid `n+1` Problems:**  Use eager loading strategically to avoid the "n+1 query problem," where fetching a list of items and then their related data results in a separate query for each item.
    * **Use `select()` to limit columns:** Only select the columns that are actually needed. Avoid `select *`.

2.  **Indexing (Specific Actions):**

    *   **Identify Frequently Queried Columns:**  Analyze application logs and database query performance to identify columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
    *   **Create Indexes:**  Create indexes on these columns.  Consider composite indexes for queries that filter on multiple columns.
        *   **Example (Laravel Migration):**
            ```php
            Schema::table('incidents', function (Blueprint $table) {
                $table->index('created_at');
                $table->index('status');
                $table->index(['created_at', 'status']); // Composite index
            });
            ```
    *   **Full-Text Indexing:**  If Cachet has search functionality, use full-text indexing (e.g., MySQL's `FULLTEXT` index) on text columns that are searched.
    *   **Regular Index Maintenance:**  Monitor index usage and performance.  Rebuild or reorganize indexes as needed.

3.  **Rate Limiting (Specific Actions):**

    *   **API-Specific Rate Limits:**  Implement rate limiting on *all* API endpoints, with stricter limits on endpoints that are known to be potentially resource-intensive (e.g., those fetching large datasets).
    *   **IP-Based Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of requests from a single IP address within a given time window.
    *   **User-Based Rate Limiting:**  If Cachet has user accounts, limit the number of requests per user.
    *   **Dynamic Rate Limiting:**  Consider adjusting rate limits dynamically based on server load or database performance.
    * **Use a dedicated package:** Leverage packages like `laravel/throttler` for easier implementation.

4.  **Regular Database Performance Audits (Specific Actions):**

    *   **Slow Query Logging:**  Enable slow query logging in your database server (e.g., MySQL's slow query log).  Regularly review the log to identify slow queries.
    *   **Query Profiling:**  Use database profiling tools (e.g., MySQL's `EXPLAIN` statement, or tools like Percona Toolkit) to analyze the execution plan of queries and identify bottlenecks.
    *   **Performance Monitoring:**  Implement database performance monitoring (e.g., using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic) to track key metrics like query execution time, CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O.
    *   **Load Testing:**  Regularly perform load testing on your Cachet instance to simulate high traffic and identify performance bottlenecks *before* they impact users.

5. **Caching:** Implement caching strategies to reduce database load. Cache frequently accessed data, such as incident lists or metric data, using a caching layer like Redis or Memcached.

6. **Queueing:** Offload long-running tasks, such as sending notifications, to a queue to prevent them from blocking the main application thread.

7. **Database Choice:** While likely not feasible to change at this stage, consider if the chosen database technology (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) is the best fit for the application's workload.  Different databases have different strengths and weaknesses.

## 5. Conclusion

Exploiting inefficient database queries is a credible and potentially high-impact attack vector against Cachet. By combining code review, simulated dynamic analysis, and threat modeling, we've identified specific vulnerabilities and refined the mitigation strategies. The development team should prioritize implementing the detailed recommendations, focusing on pagination, filtering, indexing, rate limiting, and regular performance audits.  These steps will significantly improve Cachet's resilience against DoS attacks and ensure its continued availability as a reliable status page application. Continuous monitoring and proactive performance tuning are crucial for maintaining a secure and performant system.

This detailed analysis provides a much more concrete and actionable plan for the development team than the initial attack tree description. It highlights specific areas of concern and provides practical examples of how to address them. Remember that the code examples are hypothetical and need to be adapted to the actual Cachet codebase.
