# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Authentication (Cachet-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_role-based_access_control__rbac__and_authentication__cachet-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Roles:** Define clear roles within your organization for interacting with Cachet (e.g., "Incident Responder," "Metrics Viewer," "Subscriber Manager," "Administrator").
2.  **Least Privilege:** Assign the *minimum* necessary permissions to each role *using Cachet's built-in role system*.  A "Metrics Viewer" should only have read-only access to metrics.
3.  **Cachet User Management:** Use Cachet's user management interface to create user accounts and assign them to the defined roles.  Do *not* make everyone an administrator.
4.  **Regular Review:** Within the Cachet admin panel, regularly review user accounts and their assigned roles. Remove or adjust permissions as needed.
5.  **Strong Passwords (Cachet Config):** Enforce strong password policies *through Cachet's configuration settings* (e.g., `.env` file or database settings, depending on Cachet version). Set minimum length and complexity requirements.
6.  **2FA/MFA (Cachet Feature):** Enable two-factor authentication for *all* accounts, especially administrative ones, *using Cachet's built-in 2FA support*. This is a configuration option within Cachet.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from viewing or modifying incident data, metrics, or subscriber information *within Cachet*.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Makes it significantly harder for attackers to gain control of Cachet user accounts.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Limits the damage a malicious insider can do within the Cachet application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced. Access is limited to authorized personnel with appropriate permissions *within Cachet*.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Risk drastically reduced, especially with 2FA enabled *within Cachet*.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Impact contained; damage limited to the scope of the compromised user's permissions *within Cachet*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic user roles (Admin, Manager, Team Member) are defined and used within Cachet.
    *   Strong password enforcement is enabled in Cachet's configuration.
    *   2FA is enabled for all administrator accounts within Cachet.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular roles are not yet defined within Cachet.
    *   2FA is *not* enforced for all non-administrative accounts within Cachet.
    *   Regular review of user roles within Cachet is not a formal process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Key Management (Cachet-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/api_key_management__cachet-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Key Generation (Cachet UI):** Generate unique API keys for each application or service *using Cachet's built-in API key management features*.
2.  **Least Privilege (API - Cachet Permissions):** Assign the minimum required permissions to each API key *within Cachet's interface*.  A key for reporting metrics should only have *write* access to metrics, not other data.
3.  **Rotation (Cachet UI):** Implement a process for regularly rotating API keys. This involves *generating new keys within Cachet and deactivating old ones*.
4. **Monitoring (Cachet Logs):** Monitor Cachet's logs for the usage of the API keys.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized applications from accessing the Cachet API *using stolen or guessed keys*.
    *   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of malicious or compromised API clients *by restricting their permissions within Cachet*.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via API (High Severity):** Limits data extraction if a key is compromised *due to Cachet's permission restrictions*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** Risk significantly reduced by requiring valid, scoped API keys *managed within Cachet*.
    *   **API Abuse:** Impact contained; malicious clients are limited by *Cachet's key permissions*.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Data loss is limited by *Cachet's key permissions*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   API keys are used for external integrations, generated within Cachet.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal API key rotation process (using Cachet's features) is not in place.
    *   API key permissions within Cachet are not granular enough (some keys have broader access than needed).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration (Cachet-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration__cachet-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Production Mode:** Ensure Cachet is running in production mode (`APP_DEBUG=false` in Cachet's `.env` file).  This is a *Cachet-specific setting*.
2.  **Database Security (Cachet Config):**
    *   Use a strong, unique password for the database user, configured *within Cachet's configuration files*.
3.  **Disable Unused Features (Cachet Settings):** Disable any Cachet features that are not being used (e.g., specific notification providers) *through Cachet's configuration options*.
4. **Audit Log Review (Cachet UI):** Regularly review Cachet's built-in audit logs (accessible through the admin panel) to monitor for suspicious activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents sensitive information from being exposed due to Cachet's debug mode being enabled.
    *   **Database Compromise (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the database *using the credentials stored in Cachet's configuration*.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions (Medium Severity):** Detect unauthorized actions by reviewing Cachet's audit logs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced by disabling Cachet's debug mode.
    *   **Database Compromise:** Risk reduced by using a strong database password *configured within Cachet*.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions:**  Improved detection through Cachet's audit log review.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Cachet is running in production mode.
    *   The database user has a strong password configured in Cachet.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Unused notification providers are not disabled within Cachet's configuration.
    *   Regular review of Cachet's audit logs is not performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Output Encoding (Theme/Component Level - Cachet Code)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_output_encoding__themecomponent_level_-_cachet_code_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Points (Cachet Code):** Identify all points within *Cachet's codebase* (including custom themes or components) where user-provided data is used.
2.  **Validation (Cachet Code):** Validate all user input *within Cachet's PHP code* against expected data types, formats, and lengths.
3.  **Output Encoding (Cachet/Twig):** Use appropriate output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) when displaying user-provided data *within Cachet's templates (Twig)*. Leverage Twig's auto-escaping features (`{{ variable|e }}` or `{{ variable|escape }}`).
4.  **Context-Specific Encoding (Cachet/Twig):** Use the correct encoding function for the specific context within *Cachet's Twig templates* (e.g., HTML attribute encoding, JavaScript encoding).
5.  **Testing (Cachet Code):** Thoroughly test *Cachet's code and templates* for XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into the Cachet status page *through vulnerabilities in Cachet's code or templates*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced by proper input validation and output encoding *within Cachet's codebase*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The default Cachet theme uses Twig's auto-escaping features.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A custom component added to Cachet recently does *not* properly validate or encode user input *within its PHP code*.
    *   No automated XSS testing is performed specifically on Cachet's code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Communication and Verification for Incident Updates (Cachet Features)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_communication_and_verification_for_incident_updates__cachet_features_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Designated Communicators (Cachet Users):** Limit the number of individuals authorized to post and update incidents *by managing user roles and permissions within Cachet*.
2. **Audit Log Review (Cachet UI):** Regularly review Cachet's built-in audit logs (accessible through the admin panel) to monitor for unauthorized or suspicious activity related to incident updates. This is a *Cachet-specific feature*.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Misinformation/Disinformation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of inaccurate information being published *by limiting who can post within Cachet*.
    * **Unauthorized Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents sensitive information disclosure *by restricting access within Cachet*.
    * **Unauthorized Actions (Medium Severity):** Detect unauthorized actions by reviewing *Cachet's audit logs*.

* **Impact:**
    * **Misinformation:** Risk reduced by limiting access to create/update incidents *within Cachet*.
    * **Unauthorized Disclosure:** Risk reduced by restricting access *within Cachet*.
    * **Unauthorized Actions:** Improved detection through *Cachet's audit log review*.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Only a small team has access to create and update incidents *within Cachet*.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Regular review of *Cachet's audit logs* is not performed.
