## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) Specific to Cachet [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos__specific_to_cachet__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Attacks aimed at making the Cachet status page unavailable or unresponsive to legitimate users. This directly impacts the core functionality of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Inefficient Database Queries (Cachet-Specific) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_inefficient_database_queries__cachet-specific___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Leveraging poorly designed database queries to consume excessive resources, leading to slowdowns or complete service outages.
*   **1.1.1 Craft requests that trigger complex joins or full table scans on large datasets (e.g., incidents, metrics). [HIGH RISK]**
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* High (Service outage)
    *   *Effort:* Medium (Requires understanding of database structure)
    *   *Skill Level:* Medium (Database knowledge)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (May appear as performance issues initially)
    *   *Mitigation:*
        *   Database query optimization.
        *   Indexing of frequently queried columns.
        *   Rate limiting on API endpoints that fetch large datasets.
        *   Regular database performance audits.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Resource Exhaustion via API Abuse (Cachet-Specific) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_resource_exhaustion_via_api_abuse__cachet-specific___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Overloading the Cachet API with requests to consume server resources (CPU, memory, disk space, network bandwidth).
*   **1.2.1 Rapidly create a large number of incidents, components, or subscribers. [HIGH RISK]**
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* High (Service outage or significant degradation)
    *   *Effort:* Low (Scripting)
    *   *Skill Level:* Low (Basic scripting)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Unusual API activity)
    *   *Mitigation:*
        *   Strict API rate limiting.
        *   Input validation (limit lengths, prevent unreasonable values).
        *   CAPTCHA on public-facing forms (if applicable).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit known vulnerabilities in Cachet or its dependencies. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_cachet_or_its_dependencies___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Taking advantage of publicly disclosed or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Cachet codebase or its third-party libraries.
*   *Likelihood:* Medium (Depends on vulnerability disclosure and patching)
*   *Impact:* Very High (Complete system compromise)
*   *Effort:* Varies (From Low to High, depending on the vulnerability)
*   *Skill Level:* Varies (From Low to High)
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Varies (From Low to High)
*   *Mitigation:*
    *   Regularly update Cachet and all its dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Cachet and related projects.
    *   Conduct regular penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulation of Status Information [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulation_of_status_information__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:**  Attacks that aim to alter the status information displayed by Cachet, leading to misinformation and loss of trust.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Unauthorized Modification of Incidents/Components (Cachet-Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_unauthorized_modification_of_incidentscomponents__cachet-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**  Changing the status of incidents or components without proper authorization.
*   **2.1.1 Bypass authentication/authorization checks for API endpoints related to incident/component management. [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (If proper auth is implemented) / High (If not)
    *   *Impact:* High (False status information, reputational damage)
    *   *Effort:* Medium (Requires understanding of API)
    *   *Skill Level:* Medium (API exploitation)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Unusual API activity, audit logs)
    *   *Mitigation:*
        *   Thoroughly review and test API endpoint security.
        *   Ensure proper role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented and enforced.
        *   Use strong authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Unauthorized Access to Subscriber Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_unauthorized_access_to_subscriber_data__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining access to, modifying, or deleting subscriber information (e.g., email addresses).
*   **2.2.1 Exploit vulnerabilities in the subscriber management API to view, modify, or delete subscriber information. [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (If API is secured) / High (If not)
    *   *Impact:* High (Data breach, privacy violation)
    *   *Effort:* Medium (Requires understanding of API)
    *   *Skill Level:* Medium (API exploitation)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Unusual API activity, audit logs)
    *   *Mitigation:*
        *   Secure API endpoints.
        *   Implement RBAC.
        *   Validate all input.
        *   Encrypt sensitive subscriber data at rest.
*   **2.2.2 Gain access to the database and directly extract subscriber data. [CRITICAL]**
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (If database is secured)
    *   *Impact:* Very High (Data breach, privacy violation)
    *   *Effort:* High (Requires significant access)
    *   *Skill Level:* High (Database exploitation)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* High (Unless database auditing is in place)
    *   *Mitigation:*
        *   Strong database credentials.
        *   Restrict database access to only necessary users/services.
        *   Database encryption at rest.
        *   Regular database security audits.
