# Attack Surface Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized API Access/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_api_accessmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the Cachet API to control or extract data.
*   **Cachet Contribution:** Cachet's core functionality is *fundamentally* API-driven.  Nearly all actions, from creating incidents to updating component status, are performed via the API. This makes the API the *primary* attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a leaked or guessed API key to create a false incident, reporting a major outage that didn't occur.
*   **Impact:**  Disruption of service, misinformation, reputational damage, potential data loss or exposure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust API key management (generation, storage, rotation, revocation, strong entropy).  Enforce strong authentication and fine-grained authorization (RBAC) for *all* API endpoints, with no exceptions.  Implement strict input validation and sanitization, assuming all API input is potentially malicious. Implement rate limiting and throttling.
    *   **Users:**  Use strong, unique API keys (long, random).  Regularly rotate API keys (automate if possible).  Monitor API usage logs *proactively* for suspicious activity (unusual IP addresses, unexpected requests).  Implement a WAF or API gateway to filter malicious traffic and enforce rate limits.

## Attack Surface: [Subscriber Data Exposure/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/subscriber_data_exposuremanipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access to or modification of subscriber information (email addresses, phone numbers).
*   **Cachet Contribution:** Cachet *stores and manages* subscriber data specifically for the purpose of sending notifications. This data is a direct consequence of Cachet's functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the database and exports the entire subscriber list, then uses it for spam or phishing campaigns.
*   **Impact:**  Privacy violation, potential legal repercussions (GDPR, etc.), reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Encrypt subscriber data *at rest* (using strong encryption) and *in transit* (HTTPS).  Implement strict, least-privilege access controls to subscriber data.  Sanitize and validate all subscriber input rigorously. Implement data minimization principles – only store necessary data.
    *   **Users:**  Use strong passwords for administrative accounts.  Regularly audit subscriber data and access logs.  Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* administrative access.

## Attack Surface: [False Status Reporting / Metric Data Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/false_status_reporting__metric_data_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Altering component status or metric data to misrepresent system health.
*   **Cachet Contribution:** Cachet's *core purpose* is to display status and metrics.  The ability to update this data is a fundamental feature of Cachet, and thus a direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies metric data to hide a denial-of-service attack, making it appear that the system is operating normally.
*   **Impact:**  Delayed response to real issues, incorrect operational decisions, potential escalation of problems, masking of security incidents.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement *very* strict access controls to component and metric update functionality, ideally requiring multiple approvals for changes.  Use digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of metric data, *especially* if sourced externally.  Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual changes and flag them for review.
    *   **Users:**  Restrict access to the component and metric update features to a *minimal* number of authorized personnel.  Implement a robust change management process.  Monitor for unexpected changes in status or metrics *continuously*.

## Attack Surface: [Incident Data Manipulation / Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/incident_data_manipulation__disclosure.md)

*   **Description:**  Creating, modifying, deleting, or accessing incident data without authorization.
*   **Cachet Contribution:** Cachet *stores and manages* incident details, which are often sensitive and contain information about vulnerabilities or outages. This is a direct function of the application.
*   **Example:** An attacker deletes incident records to cover up evidence of a security breach.
*   **Impact:**  Loss of critical information, hindered incident response, potential exposure of sensitive data, compliance violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strong, least-privilege access controls to incident management features.  Consider encrypting sensitive information within incident descriptions *at rest*.  Implement comprehensive audit logging for *all* incident-related actions, including reads. Enforce immutability of incident logs where possible.
    *   **Users:**  Restrict access to incident management features to a *minimal* set of authorized personnel.  Regularly review audit logs for any unauthorized access or modifications.  Implement data retention policies and secure deletion procedures.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins/Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_pluginsextensions.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in installed plugins to compromise the Cachet instance.
*   **Cachet Contribution:** Cachet's *plugin architecture* directly enables the introduction of third-party code, expanding the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a poorly maintained plugin to gain shell access to the server.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data loss, potential lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Provide *very* clear guidelines and security requirements for plugin development.  Implement a *mandatory* and rigorous plugin vetting process before allowing plugins to be listed or used. Consider sandboxing plugins.
    *   **Users:**  *Extremely* carefully vet all plugins before installation – research the developer, review the code if possible, and check for known vulnerabilities.  Keep plugins updated to the *latest* versions *immediately* upon release.  Remove *all* unused plugins.  Monitor for security advisories related to installed plugins.  Consider a "no plugins" policy if security is paramount.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Scheduled Tasks](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_scheduled_tasks.md)

*   **Description:**  Tampering with scheduled tasks to execute malicious code.
*   **Cachet Contribution:** If Cachet uses scheduled tasks for maintenance, updates, or metric collection, these tasks are potential targets *created by Cachet's operation*.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a scheduled task that updates metrics to instead execute a script that exfiltrates data.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Securely configure scheduled tasks, limiting permissions of the user running them to the *absolute minimum* required. Validate the integrity of scripts executed by tasks using checksums or digital signatures.
    *   **Users:** Monitor scheduled task execution and logs *proactively*. Restrict access to modify scheduled tasks to a *minimal* number of authorized users.
