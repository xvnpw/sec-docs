# Threat Model Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Threat: [Forged Incident Creation via API](./threats/forged_incident_creation_via_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses API authentication (e.g., due to a weak or leaked API key, or a vulnerability in the API authentication logic) and uses the Cachet API to create false incidents or update component statuses with incorrect information. This directly exploits Cachet's API functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Misinformation about service status, erosion of user trust, potential cover-up of real incidents.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/IncidentController.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ComponentController.php` (and related API routes), API authentication middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Cachet API with strong, unique API keys.
        *   Implement and enforce API key rotation policies.
        *   Implement strict input validation on all API endpoints (e.g., checking data types, lengths, and allowed values).
        *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
        *   Log all API requests and monitor for suspicious activity (e.g., high volume of incident creation from a single IP).
        *   Consider using OAuth 2.0 for API authentication instead of simple API keys.

## Threat: [Codebase Tampering (Backdoor Injection)](./threats/codebase_tampering__backdoor_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the server's filesystem and modifies Cachet's PHP files, injecting a backdoor or malicious code. This directly targets the Cachet codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Cachet instance, potential data exfiltration, ability to manipulate all aspects of the status page, potential lateral movement to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** All PHP files within the Cachet installation directory, particularly those in `app/`, `resources/views/`, and `public/`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes to Cachet's files.
        *   Run Cachet as a non-privileged user with minimal filesystem permissions.
        *   Regularly update Cachet to the latest version.
        *   Use a read-only filesystem for the Cachet application code where possible.
        *   Deploy Cachet using containerization (e.g., Docker) to isolate the application.
        *   Implement strong server security practices (e.g., SSH key authentication, regular security audits).

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via API Abuse](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Cachet API with a large number of requests (e.g., creating incidents, updating components, or requesting data), overwhelming the server and making the status page unavailable. This directly targets Cachet's API.
    *   **Impact:** Status page becomes inaccessible, preventing users from receiving updates about service status, potential disruption of monitoring systems that rely on Cachet.
    *   **Affected Component:** All API endpoints (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/*`), web server configuration, server resources (CPU, memory, network).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict rate limiting on all API endpoints.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic and identify DoS patterns.
        *   Deploy Cachet on a scalable infrastructure that can handle increased traffic loads.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and configure alerts for high CPU, memory, or network utilization.
        *   Consider using a CDN to cache static assets and reduce the load on the origin server.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Cachet](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_cachet.md)

* **Description:** A user with limited privileges exploits a vulnerability in Cachet's authorization logic to gain administrative privileges or access restricted data. This is a direct vulnerability within Cachet's code.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, potential for complete system compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** Authorization middleware (`app/Http/Middleware/*`), role-based access control logic (if implemented), controllers handling restricted actions (e.g., `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/*`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Cachet to the latest version to patch any known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
        * Thoroughly review Cachet's authorization logic to ensure it correctly enforces access controls.
        * Implement robust testing, including security testing, to identify and address privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        * Use a well-vetted authorization library or framework.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Configuration Modification](./threats/unauthorized_configuration_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Cachet administrative interface and modifies system settings. While access might be gained through external means, the vulnerability lies in Cachet's lack of sufficient protection for its configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of user trust, potential phishing attacks, disruption of service monitoring, misrepresentation of service status.
    *   **Affected Component:** `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/SettingsController.php` (and related settings routes), database tables storing configuration data (e.g., `settings`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong, unique passwords for all administrative accounts.
        *   Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative logins.
        *   Restrict access to the administrative interface using IP whitelisting or a VPN.
        *   Regularly audit configuration changes and implement configuration version control.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to restrict access to the `/dashboard` routes.
