# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Information Disclosure on Public Status Page](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_information_disclosure_on_public_status_page.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Information Disclosure on Public Status Page
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review the default information displayed by Cachet on the public status page (components, metrics, incidents).
    *   Step 2: Identify any information that is not strictly necessary for external users to understand the general service status. This could include overly specific component names, internal system details, or verbose error messages.
    *   Step 3: Customize Cachet's configuration and content to display only essential, user-centric information. Use generic component names, high-level metrics, and simplified incident descriptions. Avoid exposing internal infrastructure details or technical jargon.
    *   Step 4: Regularly audit the public status page content after any updates or changes to ensure no new sensitive information is inadvertently exposed through Cachet.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Leakage (Cachet Specific) - Severity: Medium
    *   Reconnaissance (Targeting Cachet exposed information) - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Leakage: High reduction - Directly reduces the amount of potentially sensitive internal information exposed via Cachet.
    *   Reconnaissance: Medium reduction - Makes it harder for attackers to gather detailed information about the internal systems by observing the public status page.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Organizations likely consider what information to display, but a formal process for minimizing disclosure might be missing.
    *   Location: Content creation and configuration within Cachet's admin panel, initial setup phase.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal guidelines for content minimization, automated checks for excessive information disclosure in Cachet configurations, ongoing review process integrated with content updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting on Cachet Public Pages](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_on_cachet_public_pages.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rate Limiting on Cachet Public Pages
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify the public-facing URLs of your Cachet status page (e.g., the main status page, API endpoints if publicly accessible).
    *   Step 2: Implement rate limiting specifically for these Cachet public pages. This can be done at the web server level (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or using a reverse proxy/CDN in front of Cachet.
    *   Step 3: Configure rate limits that are appropriate for legitimate user traffic to the status page, while effectively limiting excessive requests from potential attackers. Consider different limits for different endpoints if needed.
    *   Step 4: Ensure rate limiting is configured to return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) when limits are exceeded, informing users of the rate limit.
    *   Step 5: Monitor rate limiting effectiveness and adjust limits as needed based on traffic patterns and potential attack attempts targeting the Cachet status page.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) targeting Cachet public pages - Severity: High
    *   Brute-Force Attacks against public Cachet API endpoints (if exposed) - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): High reduction - Significantly reduces the impact of DoS attacks aimed at making the Cachet status page unavailable.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: Medium reduction - Makes brute-force attempts against public Cachet API endpoints slower and less effective.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General web server rate limiting might be in place, but specific configuration for Cachet public pages might be missing.
    *   Location: Web server configuration (Nginx, Apache), Load Balancer/CDN configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Rate limiting rules specifically tailored for Cachet's public endpoints, automated deployment of these rules, monitoring and alerting on rate limiting events related to Cachet.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) for Cachet Public Pages](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__for_cachet_public_pages.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Content Security Policy (CSP) for Cachet Public Pages
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a strict Content Security Policy specifically for the public-facing Cachet status pages.
    *   Step 2: Start with a restrictive CSP that only allows necessary resources from trusted sources. A good starting point is `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';`.
    *   Step 3: Configure the web server hosting Cachet to send the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with each response for the status page.
    *   Step 4: Thoroughly test the CSP in a staging environment to ensure it doesn't break the functionality of the Cachet status page. Use browser developer tools to identify and resolve any CSP violations.
    *   Step 5: Monitor CSP reports (if configured using `report-uri` or `report-to` directives) to identify potential policy violations and refine the CSP over time to maintain security and functionality of the Cachet status page.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on Cachet public pages - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High reduction - Effectively mitigates many types of XSS attacks targeting the public Cachet status page by controlling resource loading.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely missing or partially implemented with a very basic CSP. Requires deliberate configuration for Cachet.
    *   Location: Web server configuration (Nginx, Apache), application framework configuration (if applicable for header injection).
