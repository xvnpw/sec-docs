# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a public facing status page to communicate system uptime, incidents, and maintenance.
  - Improve customer trust and transparency by proactively reporting service status.
  - Reduce support tickets related to service outages by providing self-service status information.
  - Enhance brand reputation by demonstrating reliability and open communication.
  - Enable internal teams to quickly understand service health and respond to incidents effectively.

- Business Risks:
  - Misinformation or delayed updates on the status page can erode customer trust and increase support load.
  - Status page downtime can negate its purpose and further damage customer trust during incidents.
  - Security breaches of the status page could lead to misinformation, defacement, or access to sensitive internal information.
  - Inaccurate or incomplete status information can lead to poor decision-making by internal teams and customers.
  - Lack of automation in status updates can lead to delays and inaccuracies, especially during critical incidents.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: HTTPS enforced for web traffic (assumed based on common web application practices).
  - security control: Regular software updates and patching of dependencies (assumed best practice).
  - security control: Input validation on web forms to prevent basic injection attacks (assumed best practice).
  - security control: Authentication and authorization for administrative access to manage the status page (described in application documentation).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for outdated dependencies if not actively maintained.
  - accepted risk: Basic input validation might not cover all types of injection attacks.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
  - security control: Integrate with a vulnerability scanning tool (SAST/DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
  - security control: Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing.
  - security control: Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
  - security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring for security events.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanism for administrative users.
    - requirement: Option for multi-factor authentication for administrators.
    - requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage different administrative privileges.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege applied to user roles and permissions.
    - requirement: Clear separation of roles for viewing status and managing status page settings.
  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.).
    - requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to neutralize potentially malicious input.
    - requirement: Use of parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection.
  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) using encryption at rest.
    - requirement: Secure transmission of sensitive data using HTTPS/TLS.
    - requirement: Use of strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    - requirement: Proper key management practices for encryption keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Communicating service status to customers and stakeholders during incidents and maintenance.
  - Maintaining customer trust and transparency regarding service reliability.
  - Reducing support load by providing self-service status information.
  - Enabling internal teams to monitor service health and respond to incidents effectively.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Low to Medium Sensitivity:
    - Status information (component status, incident descriptions, maintenance schedules) - Publicly accessible information, but integrity is important to maintain trust.
    - User subscriptions (email addresses for notifications) - Should be protected to prevent spam and maintain user privacy.
    - Administrative credentials - High sensitivity, requires strong protection to prevent unauthorized access and control of the status page.
    - Application configuration and database credentials - High sensitivity, requires strong protection to prevent system compromise.
    - Audit logs - Medium sensitivity, important for security monitoring and incident investigation.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the status page?
  - What are the specific notification channels required (email, SMS, etc.)?
  - What level of customization and branding is required for the status page?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered?
  - What is the organization's incident response process and how does the status page integrate with it?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to improve customer communication and trust through a public status page. The organization values transparency and proactive communication.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security practices are in place, but there is room for improvement in areas like WAF, vulnerability scanning, and MFA. The organization is willing to invest in security to protect the status page and maintain customer trust.
  - DESIGN: The application is a typical web application with a database, cache, and message queue. Deployment will be in a cloud environment for scalability and availability. A standard CI/CD pipeline will be used for building and deploying the application.
