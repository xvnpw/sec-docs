# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies for Administrator Accounts](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_for_administrator_accounts.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure Password Complexity within Cachet (if possible):** Check Cachet's configuration files (e.g., `.env` or admin settings) for options to enforce password complexity requirements. This might include settings for minimum password length, character requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
2.  **Implement Password Strength Meter (if possible via Cachet extensions/customization):** Explore if Cachet offers extensions or customization points to integrate a password strength meter into the admin user creation and password change forms. If feasible, implement a meter to provide visual feedback to administrators.
3.  **Educate Administrators on Password Best Practices:**  Regardless of technical enforcement, provide clear guidelines and training to Cachet administrators on creating and managing strong, unique passwords for their Cachet accounts.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers using stolen credentials from other breaches to access Cachet admin accounts.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Admin Login (Medium Severity):** Makes brute-force attacks against Cachet's admin login page significantly harder.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks (Medium Severity):** Protects against attackers guessing common passwords for Cachet admin accounts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:** High Risk Reduction. Strong passwords are less likely to be compromised in external breaches and reused for Cachet.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Admin Login:** High Risk Reduction. Exponentially increases the time and resources needed for successful brute-force attacks against Cachet login.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:** High Risk Reduction. Makes dictionary attacks ineffective against Cachet admin passwords.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Cachet likely has basic password handling, but robust complexity enforcement and strength meters are often not standard features. The level of enforcement depends on the specific Cachet version and configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Strong password complexity enforcement, password strength meters, and potentially password history features are often missing or not fully configurable within standard Cachet installations. These might require code modifications or extensions to Cachet itself.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Administrator Accounts](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__for_administrator_accounts.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Check for Native Cachet MFA Support:**  Thoroughly investigate if the specific Cachet version you are using offers built-in MFA support or officially supported plugins/extensions. Consult Cachet documentation and community resources.
2.  **Explore Cachet Authentication Extension Points:** If native MFA is absent, determine if Cachet provides any authentication extension points or APIs that could be leveraged to integrate MFA. This might involve custom development or using community-developed extensions.
3.  **Consider External MFA Solutions with Reverse Proxy (If direct Cachet integration is not feasible):** As a less direct Cachet-centric approach, if direct integration is impossible, explore using a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) with MFA modules to protect access to the `/admin` path *before* requests reach Cachet. This is less ideal as it's external to Cachet's application logic.
4.  **Enforce MFA for All Cachet Admins:**  Once an MFA solution is implemented (ideally within or directly integrated with Cachet), make it mandatory for all administrator accounts.
5.  **Establish Cachet Admin MFA Recovery Process:** Define a secure recovery process within the context of Cachet admin accounts in case an administrator loses access to their MFA device. This might involve recovery codes generated within Cachet or a documented admin account recovery procedure.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Compromise (High Severity):** Significantly reduces the impact of stolen Cachet admin passwords (e.g., from phishing or malware). Even if passwords are compromised, attackers cannot access Cachet admin panel without the second factor.
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Prevents Cachet admin account takeover even if passwords are known to attackers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Compromise:** High Risk Reduction. MFA adds a critical second layer of defense specifically for Cachet admin accounts against credential-based attacks.
    *   **Account Takeover:** High Risk Reduction. Makes Cachet admin account takeover extremely difficult without access to the user's MFA device.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Generally *not* implemented natively in standard Cachet installations. MFA is often a missing feature directly within Cachet. Implementation usually requires external solutions or custom development efforts focused on Cachet.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Native MFA support within Cachet's core application is often missing. Implementation requires finding or developing Cachet-specific solutions or relying on less integrated external methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Cachet and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_cachet_and_its_dependencies.md)

1.  **Monitor CachetHQ for Security Updates:**  Actively monitor the official CachetHQ website, GitHub repository, security mailing lists, and community channels for announcements of new Cachet releases, especially security updates and patches.
2.  **Establish a Cachet Update Process:** Define a clear process specifically for updating Cachet. This should include:
    *   **Staging Environment Testing (Cachet Focused):**  Always test Cachet updates in a staging environment that is a replica of your production Cachet setup *before* applying updates to the live Cachet instance.
    *   **Cachet Backup Procedure:**  Establish a reliable backup procedure specifically for your Cachet application files and database *before* each update.
    *   **Follow Cachet Update Instructions:**  Carefully follow the official update instructions provided by the CachetHQ project for each specific Cachet version update.
3.  **Update Cachet Dependencies (PHP, Libraries):**  Regularly update Cachet's PHP dependencies (managed by Composer) and any other libraries or components used by Cachet to patch vulnerabilities in these underlying components.
4.  **Schedule Regular Cachet Updates:**  Create a schedule for checking and applying Cachet updates (e.g., monthly or quarterly), prioritizing security updates for immediate application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Cachet Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Patches known security vulnerabilities specifically within the Cachet application and its code, preventing attackers from exploiting these weaknesses.
    *   **Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Addresses vulnerabilities in PHP libraries and other dependencies used by Cachet, reducing the attack surface related to these components.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** While updates don't prevent zero-day attacks, staying up-to-date minimizes the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered Cachet or dependency vulnerabilities before patches are available.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Cachet Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction. Directly eliminates known security flaws within Cachet itself.
    *   **Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction. Addresses vulnerabilities in components Cachet relies on.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces the overall risk by minimizing the time window for exploitation of new vulnerabilities in Cachet and its dependencies.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Not automatically implemented within Cachet. Updating Cachet and its dependencies is a manual process that Cachet users must actively manage.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated update mechanisms specifically for Cachet core and its dependencies are generally not provided by Cachet itself. Users are responsible for manually monitoring and applying updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of Cachet Application](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_cachet_application.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Secure Cachet `.env` File:**
    *   **Restrict Web Access to `.env` (Cachet Specific):**  Ensure your web server configuration *specifically* prevents direct web access to the `.env` file in your Cachet installation directory. This is crucial as `.env` contains sensitive Cachet configuration.
    *   **Cachet `.env` File Permissions:** Set file permissions on the Cachet `.env` file to restrict read access to only the web server user and authorized administrators on the server.
    *   **Secure Storage of Cachet `.env`:** Store the Cachet `.env` file securely on the server, ensuring it's not in a publicly accessible location or easily discoverable.
2.  **Secure Cachet Database Configuration:**
    *   **Strong Cachet Database Credentials:** Use strong, unique passwords specifically for the database user that Cachet uses to connect to the database.
    *   **Least Privilege for Cachet Database User:** Grant the Cachet database user only the *minimum* necessary database permissions required for Cachet to function correctly. Avoid granting excessive privileges like `GRANT ALL`.
3.  **Disable Unused Cachet Features/Modules:** Review Cachet's configuration and disable or remove any Cachet features or modules that are not actively being used for your status page. This reduces the potential attack surface of your specific Cachet instance.
4.  **Review Default Cachet Settings:** Review all default configuration settings within Cachet (accessible through admin panel or configuration files) and change any insecure defaults to more secure values.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Cachet Configuration (High Severity):** Prevents exposure of database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive Cachet configuration data if the `.env` file is misconfigured or publicly accessible.
    *   **Cachet Database Compromise (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of database compromise related to Cachet by using strong credentials and limiting database user permissions specifically for Cachet's database access.
    *   **Unnecessary Cachet Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Minimizes the attack surface of your Cachet installation by disabling unused features, reducing potential entry points for attackers targeting Cachet-specific functionalities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Cachet Configuration:** High Risk Reduction. Prevents critical Cachet configuration data leaks.
    *   **Cachet Database Compromise:** High Risk Reduction. Strengthens database security specifically for Cachet and limits potential damage from attacks targeting Cachet's database.
    *   **Unnecessary Cachet Attack Surface:** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces the overall attack surface of the Cachet application itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Cachet's default setup *expects* secure configuration, but it's the user's responsibility to implement these secure configurations for Cachet specifically. Cachet itself doesn't enforce strong `.env` permissions or database security settings.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated checks or guidance within Cachet to ensure secure configuration are generally missing. Users need to be aware of and manually implement these security measures specific to Cachet's configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting for Cachet API Endpoints (if API is exposed)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_for_cachet_api_endpoints__if_api_is_exposed_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Exposed Cachet API Endpoints:** Determine which API endpoints of Cachet are publicly exposed and used for integrations or automated updates to your status page.
2.  **Implement Rate Limiting for Cachet API:** Implement rate limiting specifically on these identified Cachet API endpoints. This is best done at the web server level (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to protect Cachet from excessive API requests.
3.  **Configure Cachet API Rate Limits:** Set appropriate rate limits for Cachet API endpoints based on expected legitimate API usage patterns. Start with conservative limits and adjust as needed based on monitoring.
4.  **Cachet API Rate Limit Response Handling:** Configure how rate limiting is enforced for Cachet API requests (e.g., return HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" status code to API clients, provide `Retry-After` headers).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Cachet API (Medium Severity):** Limits the rate of requests to Cachet's API, making brute-force attacks against API authentication or data endpoints less effective.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Cachet API (Medium Severity):** Protects Cachet's API from simple DoS attacks that attempt to overwhelm it with excessive requests, ensuring status page availability.
    *   **Cachet API Abuse (Medium Severity):** Prevents abuse of the Cachet API by malicious actors or misconfigured integrations, protecting status page resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Cachet API:** Medium Risk Reduction. Makes brute-force attacks against Cachet API slower and less likely to succeed.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Cachet API:** Medium Risk Reduction. Mitigates simple DoS attempts specifically aimed at Cachet's API.
    *   **Cachet API Abuse:** Medium Risk Reduction. Controls Cachet API usage and prevents abuse, protecting status page functionality.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Generally *not* implemented natively within Cachet itself. Rate limiting for Cachet's API usually needs to be implemented externally at the web server level.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Built-in rate limiting specifically for Cachet's API endpoints is often missing. Implementation requires external solutions configured to protect Cachet's API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Output Encoding within Cachet Codebase](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_output_encoding_within_cachet_codebase.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Cachet Code for Input Validation:**  Conduct a code review of the Cachet codebase, especially any custom modifications or extensions, to ensure robust input validation is implemented for all user inputs processed by Cachet.
2.  **Implement Server-Side Validation in Cachet (PHP):** Ensure that input validation within Cachet is performed on the server-side using PHP code. Validate data types, formats, lengths, and ranges for all input fields in Cachet forms and API endpoints.
3.  **Output Encoding in Cachet Templates (Blade):** Verify that Cachet's templating engine (Blade) is used correctly to automatically encode output data before displaying it in the status page. Ensure context-aware encoding is applied to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in Cachet's output.
4.  **Sanitize Cachet Input (Carefully and as a secondary measure):** If sanitization is used within Cachet, ensure it is applied carefully and correctly to remove or escape potentially harmful characters. Prioritize validation over sanitization where possible.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Cachet (High Severity):** Prevents XSS vulnerabilities within the Cachet application itself by ensuring proper input validation and output encoding in Cachet's code and templates.
    *   **SQL Injection in Cachet (High Severity):** Input validation within Cachet helps prevent SQL injection attacks if Cachet's code directly constructs database queries based on user input.
    *   **Command Injection in Cachet (Medium Severity):** Input validation can also help mitigate command injection vulnerabilities if Cachet interacts with the operating system based on user input (though less likely in standard Cachet, but relevant for custom extensions).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Cachet:** High Risk Reduction. Effectively prevents XSS attacks within the Cachet application if input validation and output encoding are correctly implemented in Cachet's codebase.
    *   **SQL Injection in Cachet:** High Risk Reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities within Cachet.
    *   **Command Injection in Cachet:** Medium Risk Reduction. Mitigates command injection risks within Cachet.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Cachet, being built with Laravel, likely utilizes some built-in input validation and output encoding mechanisms provided by the framework. However, the comprehensiveness and correctness of these measures need to be verified, especially in custom Cachet code or integrations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive and consistent input validation and output encoding might be missing in certain parts of the Cachet codebase, particularly in custom extensions or modifications. Dedicated code reviews and security testing focused on Cachet's code are needed to ensure proper implementation across the entire application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Cachet Logs for Suspicious Activity](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_cachet_logs_for_suspicious_activity.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Cachet Application Logging:** Ensure that Cachet's application logging is enabled and configured to capture relevant security events *within Cachet*. This might involve configuring Cachet's logging settings to record login attempts, errors, API requests handled by Cachet, and other security-related actions.
2.  **Centralize Cachet Logs (Recommended):**  Centralize Cachet's application logs into a SIEM system or log management platform for easier analysis and correlation with other system logs. This allows for better visibility into Cachet-specific security events.
3.  **Define Cachet-Specific Monitoring Rules:** Define monitoring rules and alerts specifically tailored to detect suspicious activity within Cachet logs. Examples include:
    *   **Failed Cachet Admin Login Attempts:** Monitor Cachet logs for excessive failed login attempts to the Cachet admin panel.
    *   **Cachet Error Logs:** Monitor Cachet error logs for unusual patterns or errors that might indicate attacks or misconfigurations within Cachet.
    *   **Cachet API Request Anomalies:** Monitor Cachet API logs for unusual request patterns or unexpected API usage that could signal abuse.
    *   **Cachet Admin Panel Access Logs:** Log and monitor successful and failed access attempts to the Cachet admin panel within Cachet logs.
4.  **Regular Cachet Log Review:**  Regularly review Cachet logs manually or automatically using monitoring tools to identify and investigate suspicious events specifically related to Cachet activity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Active Attacks Targeting Cachet:** High Risk Reduction. Enables faster detection and response to active attacks specifically targeting Cachet, minimizing potential damage to the status page.
    *   **Unauthorized Access Attempts to Cachet Admin:** Medium Risk Reduction. Allows for detection and investigation of unauthorized access attempts to Cachet admin functions.
    *   **Cachet System Misconfigurations:** Low Risk Reduction. Helps identify and correct misconfigurations within Cachet itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Cachet likely generates application logs, but effective monitoring, centralized logging of Cachet logs, and alert rules specifically for Cachet events are usually *not* implemented out-of-the-box and require manual setup.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Proactive log monitoring, centralized logging specifically for Cachet logs, and automated alerting based on Cachet log events are often missing in standard Cachet deployments. Users need to configure these systems separately to focus on Cachet-specific security monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Uploads within Cachet (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_uploads_within_cachet__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Cachet File Upload Features:** Determine if Cachet allows file uploads (e.g., for incident attachments, component images, or custom features). If file uploads are enabled in your Cachet instance, secure them.
2.  **Restrict File Types in Cachet:**  Implement file type whitelisting within Cachet's file upload handling. Only allow necessary file types for Cachet features and reject all others at the application level.
3.  **Enforce File Size Limits in Cachet:** Enforce strict file size limits within Cachet's upload functionality to prevent denial-of-service attacks through large file uploads to Cachet.
4.  **Sanitize Cachet Uploaded Filenames:** Sanitize uploaded filenames within Cachet's code to remove or replace potentially harmful characters or directory traversal sequences before storing them.
5.  **Secure Storage Location for Cachet Uploads:** Configure Cachet to store uploaded files in a secure location *outside* the web root directory of your Cachet installation. This prevents direct web access to uploaded files via predictable URLs.
6.  **Randomize Cachet Uploaded Filenames:**  Configure Cachet to rename uploaded files to random or unique filenames upon storage to further obscure their location and prevent predictable file paths within Cachet's storage.
7.  **Integrate Virus Scanning for Cachet Uploads:** If feasible, integrate virus scanning of uploaded files within Cachet's upload processing using an antivirus engine to detect and prevent malware uploads through Cachet.
8.  **Cachet Access Controls for File Uploads:** Implement access controls within Cachet to restrict who can upload files and who can access uploaded files, based on Cachet's user roles and permissions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malware Uploads via Cachet (High Severity):** Prevents users from uploading and distributing malware through Cachet's file upload features.
