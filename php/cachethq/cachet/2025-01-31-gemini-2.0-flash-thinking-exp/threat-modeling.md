# Threat Model Analysis for cachethq/cachet

## Threat: [API Key Compromise](./threats/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to Cachet API keys. This could be through insecure storage, exposed configuration files, or vulnerabilities in systems where keys are used. Once compromised, attackers can use these keys to interact with the Cachet API.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can fully manipulate status information displayed on the status page, including component statuses, incidents, and metrics. This can lead to widespread misinformation, damage to reputation, and loss of user trust. They might also gain access to sensitive data exposed through the API.
*   **Affected Cachet Component:** API Module, API Key Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store API keys securely using environment variables, dedicated secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted storage. **Do not hardcode API keys in application code or configuration files directly.**
    *   Implement strict access control and the principle of least privilege for API keys. Grant keys only the necessary permissions.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
    *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity patterns that might indicate key compromise or unauthorized access.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all API communication to protect keys in transit.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Status Updates via API](./threats/unauthorized_status_updates_via_api.md)

*   **Description:**  Building upon API Key Compromise or exploiting other authentication vulnerabilities, an attacker uses the Cachet API to inject false status updates. This includes changing component statuses to incorrect values, creating fake incidents, or manipulating performance metrics.
*   **Impact:**  The status page becomes unreliable and misleading. Users will receive incorrect information about system availability, potentially leading to confusion, panic, and missed real outages. This severely undermines the purpose of a status page and damages trust in the reported information.
*   **Affected Cachet Component:** API Module, Component Status Module, Incident Management Module, Metrics Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure API keys as described in the "API Key Compromise" threat mitigation.
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints, especially those related to status updates.
    *   Maintain detailed audit logs of all status updates and incident creations, including the user or API key responsible. Regularly review these logs for anomalies.
    *   Consider implementing a manual review or approval process for critical status changes, especially for highly sensitive components.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Cachet relies on numerous third-party libraries and components. If these dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them through Cachet. This is especially critical if vulnerabilities allow for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Exploiting vulnerable dependencies can lead to a wide range of severe impacts, including remote code execution on the Cachet server, complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service. The severity depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Affected Cachet Component:** All components relying on external libraries, Dependency Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a robust dependency management process. Use tools to track and manage dependencies (e.g., Composer for PHP).
    *   Regularly update Cachet and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Stay informed about security advisories for Cachet's dependencies.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., integrated into CI/CD pipelines or standalone tools like `composer audit`) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Prioritize patching or mitigating vulnerabilities in dependencies promptly, especially those with high severity ratings or known exploits.

## Threat: [Weak Default Credentials (Potentially High)](./threats/weak_default_credentials__potentially_high_.md)

*   **Description:** If Cachet is deployed with easily guessable or default administrator credentials that are not changed during or immediately after installation, attackers can attempt to log in using these credentials.
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation grants full administrative access to Cachet. This allows attackers to manipulate all aspects of the status page, including status updates, incidents, metrics, and potentially sensitive configuration settings. This can lead to severe misinformation and system compromise.
*   **Affected Cachet Component:** Installation/Setup Process, Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Potentially High (Medium if default credentials are not well-known, High if they are and not changed)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Force strong password creation during the initial setup process.** Do not allow weak or default passwords.
    *   **Remove or disable any default administrator accounts** after the initial setup is complete and a strong administrator account is created.
    *   **Clearly and prominently document the critical importance of changing default credentials** immediately after installation in the official documentation and setup guides.
    *   Consider implementing automated checks during setup to detect and warn against weak or default passwords.
