## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Cachet (Root Goal) - CRITICAL NODE:](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_cachet__root_goal__-_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. Any successful attack along the High-Risk Paths will lead to achieving this goal.
*   **How it Works:** By exploiting vulnerabilities within Cachet, an attacker aims to gain control over the application, its data, and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful compromise can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, manipulation of status information (undermining trust in the status page), service disruption, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Cachet Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses - CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_cachet_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses_-_critical_node_&_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1. Default Credentials Exploitation (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers attempt to log in using commonly known default usernames and passwords that might be present in Cachet installations if not changed during setup.
        *   **How it Works:**  Cachet, like many applications, might have default credentials for initial administrative access. If administrators fail to change these, attackers can easily find them online and gain immediate access.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Very easy to exploit, requires minimal skill, and grants immediate critical access.
    *   **1.2. Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing Attacks (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers systematically try numerous username and password combinations to guess valid credentials. Credential stuffing involves using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches.
        *   **How it Works:**  Attackers target the login endpoint of Cachet. Without proper rate limiting or strong password policies, they can attempt many logins until they guess a valid combination or find a match in their credential lists.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Relatively easy to automate, can be successful against weak passwords or systems lacking proper protection mechanisms.

*   **Why Critical:** Authentication is the primary security control. Bypassing it grants attackers unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data within Cachet.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Cachet Input Validation Vulnerabilities - CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_cachet_input_validation_vulnerabilities_-_critical_node_&_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields within Cachet. This code is then executed in the browsers of users who view the affected content.
        *   **How it Works:** Cachet displays user-generated content (incident names, messages, component names). If these inputs are not properly sanitized and encoded, attackers can inject scripts that execute when other users (including administrators) view this content.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Common web vulnerability, can lead to user session hijacking, defacement, information theft, and potentially administrative access if an admin user is targeted.
        *   **2.1.1. Stored XSS (Incident/Component Names, Messages, etc.) (HIGH RISK PATH):** The malicious script is permanently stored in Cachet's database and affects all users viewing the content.
        *   **2.1.2. Reflected XSS (URL Parameters, Search Queries) (HIGH RISK PATH):** The malicious script is injected via URL parameters and only affects users who click on the crafted malicious link.
    *   **2.2. SQL Injection (Database Interaction) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields that are used in database queries by Cachet. This can allow them to manipulate the database, bypass authentication, or exfiltrate data.
        *   **How it Works:** If Cachet's database queries are not properly parameterized, attackers can insert SQL commands into input fields. These commands are then executed by the database, potentially granting the attacker full control over the database.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Can lead to complete database compromise, data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially server compromise.
    *   **2.4. HTML Injection/Content Spoofing (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTML code into input fields within Cachet. This can be used to deface the status page, mislead users, or conduct phishing attacks.
        *   **How it Works:** If Cachet does not properly sanitize HTML input, attackers can inject arbitrary HTML tags. This can alter the appearance of the status page, display misleading information, or embed links to phishing sites.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Can damage trust in the status page, mislead users about service status, and be used for social engineering attacks.

*   **Why Critical:** Input validation vulnerabilities are prevalent and can be exploited to achieve various malicious goals, ranging from user compromise to full system takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Cachet API Vulnerabilities - CRITICAL NODE:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_cachet_api_vulnerabilities_-_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **3.1. API Authentication/Authorization Bypass (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers attempt to bypass or circumvent the authentication and authorization mechanisms protecting the Cachet API.
        *   **How it Works:** If the API has weak or flawed authentication (e.g., predictable API keys, insecure OAuth implementation) or authorization (e.g., improper role-based access control), attackers can gain unauthorized access to API endpoints and functionalities.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Grants unauthorized access to API data and functionalities, allowing attackers to manipulate status information, system configuration, and potentially exfiltrate data.
    *   **3.2. API Rate Limiting Issues (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers exploit the lack of or insufficient rate limiting on Cachet API endpoints to abuse the API, causing denial of service or resource exhaustion.
        *   **How it Works:** Without rate limiting, attackers can send a large volume of requests to the API, overwhelming the server and making the status page unavailable or slow for legitimate users.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Can disrupt the availability of the status page, impacting users' ability to monitor service status.
    *   **3.3. API Input Validation Vulnerabilities (Mirrors 2.x) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Similar to web input validation vulnerabilities, but specifically targeting the API endpoints of Cachet. This includes XSS, SQL Injection, and other injection attacks via API parameters.
        *   **How it Works:** API endpoints often accept data as input. If this input is not properly validated, attackers can inject malicious payloads through API requests, leading to vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL Injection, as described in section 3.
        *   **Why High Risk:** APIs are often critical components, and input validation flaws can have similar high-impact consequences as in web interfaces.

*   **Why Critical:** APIs provide programmatic access to Cachet's functionalities. Vulnerabilities here can be exploited for automated attacks and system-wide compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Cachet Configuration Vulnerabilities - CRITICAL NODE & HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_cachet_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_critical_node_&_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **4.1. Insecure Configuration Files (e.g., .env exposure) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers gain access to sensitive configuration files, such as `.env` files, which may contain database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.
        *   **How it Works:** Misconfigurations in web server setup or deployment practices can lead to configuration files being accessible from the web. Attackers can use directory traversal techniques or simply guess common file paths to access these files.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Exposure of configuration files can reveal critical credentials, granting attackers direct access to databases, APIs, and other backend systems, leading to full compromise.

*   **Why Critical:** Configuration vulnerabilities can directly expose sensitive credentials and system settings, leading to rapid and severe compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Cachet Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities - HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_cachet_denial_of_service__dos__vulnerabilities_-_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **5.1. Application-Level DoS (Resource Exhaustion) (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Attackers exploit application-level weaknesses to exhaust server resources, making Cachet unavailable to legitimate users.
        *   **How it Works:**
            *   **5.1.1. Slowloris/Slow Post Attacks (HIGH RISK PATH):** Attackers send slow, incomplete HTTP requests to keep server connections open and exhaust connection limits, preventing legitimate requests from being processed.
            *   **5.1.2. Excessive Resource Consumption (e.g., large file uploads, complex queries) (HIGH RISK PATH):** Attackers trigger resource-intensive operations within Cachet, such as uploading very large files or sending complex queries, to overload the server's CPU, memory, or disk I/O.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Can easily disrupt the availability of the status page, undermining its purpose of providing real-time status information.

*   **Why High Risk:** DoS attacks, while not directly leading to data theft, can severely impact the availability and reliability of the status page, which is crucial for monitoring application health.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Information Disclosure via Cachet - HIGH RISK PATH:](./attack_tree_paths/7__information_disclosure_via_cachet_-_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **7.1. Error Messages Revealing Sensitive Information (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Verbose error messages generated by Cachet unintentionally reveal sensitive information, such as internal paths, database details, or configuration settings.
        *   **How it Works:** In development or misconfigured production environments, error handling might be overly verbose. Attackers can trigger errors (e.g., by providing invalid input) and analyze the error messages to gather sensitive information.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Information disclosure can aid attackers in planning and executing more targeted and effective attacks.
    *   **7.2. Directory Listing Enabled (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Description:** Web server misconfiguration allows directory listing, enabling attackers to browse directories and potentially find sensitive files, such as configuration files or backups.
        *   **How it Works:** If directory listing is enabled on the web server hosting Cachet, attackers can simply access directories via the browser and explore their contents, potentially finding sensitive files that should not be publicly accessible.
        *   **Why High Risk:** Can lead to the discovery of sensitive files, including configuration files, backups, or even source code, which can be used for further attacks.

*   **Why High Risk:** Information disclosure, while often not a direct compromise, provides valuable reconnaissance information to attackers, increasing the likelihood and impact of other attacks.
