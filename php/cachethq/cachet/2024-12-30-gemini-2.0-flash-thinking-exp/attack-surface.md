*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Cachet Contributes:** Cachet allows users to input text in various fields like incident names, messages, component names, and descriptions. If this input is not properly sanitized before being displayed, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker creates an incident with a description containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When other users view this incident, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, or defacement of the status page.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust output encoding (escaping) of user-supplied data before rendering it in HTML. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript contexts). Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

*   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database queries.
    *   **How Cachet Contributes:** If Cachet's code directly incorporates user-provided input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection. This could occur in features related to incident creation, component management, or user authentication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious incident name like `' OR '1'='1` which, if not handled correctly, could alter the intended SQL query to bypass authentication or retrieve unauthorized data.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data (including user credentials, incident details, component information), data modification, or even complete database compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements)** when interacting with the database. This ensures that user input is treated as data, not executable code. Avoid dynamic SQL construction using string concatenation of user input. Employ an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) which often provides built-in protection against SQL injection. Regularly update database drivers and the ORM.

*   **Brute-Force Attacks on Login**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by trying numerous combinations of usernames and passwords.
    *   **How Cachet Contributes:** Cachet's login form, if not protected with rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms, can be a target for brute-force attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to repeatedly try different password combinations for a known username on the Cachet login page.
    *   **Impact:** Successful brute-force attacks can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially allowing attackers to modify status updates, create malicious incidents, or access sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts (e.g., limit the number of failed login attempts from a specific IP address within a timeframe). Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed attempts. Consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.

*   **Insecure Password Reset Mechanism**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the password reset process can allow attackers to reset other users' passwords without proper authorization.
    *   **How Cachet Contributes:** If the password reset process uses predictable reset tokens, lacks proper email verification, or allows for account takeover through the reset flow, it introduces a significant attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker requests a password reset for a target user and intercepts the reset link containing a predictable token, allowing them to set a new password for the victim's account.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, leading to unauthorized access and potential manipulation of the status page.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Generate cryptographically secure, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens. Implement proper email verification to ensure the reset request originates from the legitimate account holder. Invalidate reset tokens after use or after a short period. Avoid exposing sensitive information in the reset link.

*   **Exposure of Default Credentials (If Applicable)**
    *   **Description:**  The application ships with default usernames and passwords that are publicly known.
    *   **How Cachet Contributes:** If Cachet has default credentials that are not immediately changed upon installation, it provides an easy entry point for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default username and password to log into the administrative interface of a newly installed Cachet instance.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Cachet instance, allowing attackers to control the status page and potentially access sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Avoid including default credentials in the application. If absolutely necessary, force users to change them during the initial setup process.
