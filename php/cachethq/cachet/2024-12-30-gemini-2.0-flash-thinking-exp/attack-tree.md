## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes in Cachet Attack Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Compromise the application utilizing Cachet by exploiting vulnerabilities within Cachet itself.

**High-Risk & Critical Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Cachet [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Gain Unauthorized Access to Cachet Dashboard [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on Admin Credentials
            * Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Cachet (if any) [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Exploit Default Credentials (if any exist and are not changed) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Manipulate Displayed Status Information [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Inject False Incidents/Outages [HIGH RISK PATH]
            * Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if API is exposed without proper authentication/authorization) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Modify Existing Status Information
            * Exploit API Vulnerabilities (as above) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Inject False Metrics/Performance Data
            * Exploit API Vulnerabilities for Metric Submission [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Disrupt Cachet Service Availability [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH RISK PATH]
        * Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities Leading to Crashes [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Database Corruption
            * Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (if present in Cachet's database interactions) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Exfiltrate Sensitive Information Managed by Cachet
        * Accessing User Information (if Cachet manages user accounts)
            * Exploit Database Vulnerabilities (as above) [CRITICAL NODE]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Gain Unauthorized Access to Cachet Dashboard [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on Admin Credentials:** The attacker attempts to guess the administrator's username and password by trying a large number of common passwords or passwords derived from dictionaries. This can be automated using readily available tools.
    * **Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Cachet (if any) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker leverages publicly known security flaws in Cachet's authentication mechanism. This could involve sending specially crafted requests that bypass login checks or exploit logic errors in the authentication process. Information about such vulnerabilities is often found in security advisories and vulnerability databases.
    * **Exploit Default Credentials (if any exist and are not changed) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:** If the Cachet installation uses default usernames and passwords that haven't been changed by the administrator, the attacker can simply use these well-known credentials to gain immediate access.

**2. Manipulate Displayed Status Information [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Inject False Incidents/Outages [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Exploit API Vulnerabilities (if API is exposed without proper authentication/authorization) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:** If the Cachet API endpoints for creating or updating incidents are not properly secured with authentication and authorization, an attacker can directly send malicious API requests to create false incidents or outages. This could involve crafting HTTP POST requests with fabricated incident details.
    * **Modify Existing Status Information:**
        * **Exploit API Vulnerabilities (as above) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:** Similar to injecting false incidents, if the API endpoints for modifying existing incidents are vulnerable, an attacker can alter the status, severity, or message of existing incidents to misrepresent the system's health.
    * **Inject False Metrics/Performance Data:**
        * **Exploit API Vulnerabilities for Metric Submission [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If the API endpoint responsible for receiving and storing performance metrics lacks proper authentication or authorization, an attacker can send forged metric data to display inaccurate performance information. This could involve sending HTTP POST requests with fabricated metric values and timestamps.

**3. Disrupt Cachet Service Availability [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Resource Exhaustion (e.g., overwhelming the server with requests):** The attacker floods the Cachet server with a large volume of requests, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unresponsive to legitimate users. This can be achieved using various tools and techniques, including sending a high number of HTTP requests or exploiting vulnerabilities that amplify the impact of each request.
    * **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities Leading to Crashes [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker exploits specific bugs or vulnerabilities in the Cachet application or its dependencies that can cause the application to crash or become unstable. This often requires in-depth knowledge of the software's internals and the ability to craft specific inputs that trigger the vulnerable code.
    * **Database Corruption:**
        * **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (if present in Cachet's database interactions) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:** If Cachet's code doesn't properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into input fields. This injected code can then be executed by the database, potentially allowing the attacker to modify or delete data, including critical information needed for Cachet to function, leading to service disruption.

**4. Exfiltrate Sensitive Information Managed by Cachet:**

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Accessing User Information (if Cachet manages user accounts):**
        * **Exploit Database Vulnerabilities (as above) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If SQL injection vulnerabilities exist, an attacker can use them to query the database and extract sensitive user information, such as usernames, email addresses, and potentially even password hashes (if not properly secured).

This detailed breakdown provides a clearer understanding of the specific techniques an attacker might employ to exploit the identified high-risk paths and critical nodes within the Cachet application. This information is crucial for prioritizing security efforts and implementing effective mitigation strategies.
