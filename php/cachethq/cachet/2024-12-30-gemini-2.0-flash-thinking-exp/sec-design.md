```

**Detailed Data Flow for Creating an Incident:**

1. **Admin User Accesses Admin Panel & Input Incident Details:** The administrator accesses the administrative interface through their web browser and fills in the details for the new incident.
2. **HTTP Request (POST /api/v1/incidents):** Upon submission, the browser sends an HTTP POST request to the Web Server, targeting the `/api/v1/incidents` endpoint.
3. **Route Request to Application:** The Web Server routes the incoming request to the PHP Application.
4. **API Request to Backend:** The Laravel framework handles the routing and directs the request to the appropriate controller (Incident Controller).
5. **Authenticate & Authorize User:** The Incident Controller first authenticates the user making the request and then verifies if they have the necessary permissions to create incidents.
6. **Validate Incident Data:** The controller validates the input data to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., required fields, data types, length constraints).
7. **Create Incident Record:** If the data is valid, the controller interacts with the Database to create a new incident record.
8. **Store Incident Data:** The Database stores the new incident information persistently.
9. **Invalidate Relevant Cache Entries:** The PHP Application invalidates any cached data related to incidents to ensure that subsequent requests fetch the latest information.
10. **Dispatch Notification Job to Queue:** The application dispatches a job to the Queue Worker to handle the asynchronous task of sending notifications.
11. **Retrieve Subscribers from Database:** The Queue Worker retrieves a list of subscribers who should be notified about new incidents from the Database.
12. **Get Subscriber Details:** The Queue Worker fetches the necessary details for each subscriber, such as their email address.
13. **Send Email Notifications via Mail Server:** The Queue Worker uses the configured Mail Server (SMTP) to send email notifications to the retrieved subscribers.
14. **Return Success Response to Frontend:** The Incident Controller sends a success response back to the Frontend Application.
15. **Update UI with Success Message:** The Frontend Application updates the user interface to indicate that the incident was created successfully.
16. **Display Confirmation to User:** The administrator sees a confirmation message in their web browser.
