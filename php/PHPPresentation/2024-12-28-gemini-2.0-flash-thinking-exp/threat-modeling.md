Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the PHPOffice/PHPPresentation library:

* **Threat: Malicious File Parsing**
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially formatted presentation file (e.g., .pptx, .odp) containing malicious code or exploits vulnerabilities *within PHPPresentation's parsing logic*. Upon uploading and processing this file, the attacker aims to trigger remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure *due to flaws in how PHPPresentation handles the file format*.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** The server becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive resource consumption or a critical error *within PHPPresentation's parsing process*.
        * **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information from the server's file system or memory is exposed to the attacker *due to vulnerabilities in PHPPresentation's file handling*.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical

* **Threat: Denial of Service via Malformed Files**
    * **Description:** An attacker uploads a malformed or excessively complex presentation file that causes *PHPPresentation* to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) or enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service. The attacker exploits inefficient parsing algorithms or the library's inability to handle certain file structures gracefully *within its own code*.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** The server becomes unresponsive or experiences significant performance degradation, impacting other users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High

* **Threat: Malicious Output Generation due to Library Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** A vulnerability *within PHPPresentation itself* leads to the generation of presentation files containing malicious content (e.g., embedded scripts, macros, or exploits) even if the input data is seemingly benign. This is due to bugs in the library's logic for generating specific file structures or handling certain data types *within its own codebase*.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Compromise of User Systems:** When a user opens the generated presentation, the malicious content could exploit vulnerabilities in their presentation viewer, leading to code execution or other harmful actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
