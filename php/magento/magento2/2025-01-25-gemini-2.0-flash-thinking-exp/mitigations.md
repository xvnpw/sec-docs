Configure allowed file types in Magento 2's admin settings and server-side validation.
    2.  **File Size Limits in Magento 2:** Implement file size limits for uploads to prevent denial-of-service attacks through large file uploads and to manage storage space for your Magento 2 media. Configure file size limits in Magento 2 and server settings.
    3.  **File Storage Security for Magento 2 Media:** Store uploaded files for your Magento 2 store outside the webroot if possible. If files must be stored within the webroot (e.g., `pub/media` in Magento 2), ensure proper access controls are in place to prevent direct execution of uploaded files as scripts. Configure web server settings to prevent execution of scripts in Magento 2 upload directories (e.g., using `.htaccess` or server configuration).
    4.  **File Renaming in Magento 2 Uploads:** Rename uploaded files to unique, non-guessable names upon upload within Magento 2. This prevents attackers from overwriting existing files or predicting file URLs in your Magento 2 media storage. Magento 2 typically handles file renaming automatically.
    5.  **Antivirus Scanning (Optional but Recommended) for Magento 2 Uploads:** Consider integrating antivirus scanning for uploaded files in your Magento 2 store to detect and prevent the upload of malicious files. This can be implemented using server-side antivirus software or cloud-based scanning services integrated with your Magento 2 application.
    6.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Magento 2 Media:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header for your Magento 2 store to further mitigate the risk of executing malicious scripts even if uploaded files are compromised. Configure CSP to restrict script sources and other potentially dangerous content, especially when serving media files from Magento 2.
