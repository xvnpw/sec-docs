# Threat Model Analysis for magento/magento2

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unserialize Vulnerability](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_unserialize_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within Magento 2 core code related to insecure deserialization of PHP objects. By injecting malicious serialized PHP objects through various input vectors (e.g., API requests, form fields), they can trigger the execution of arbitrary code on the Magento server when these objects are processed by Magento's `unserialize()` function.
**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Magento server. Attackers gain full control, enabling them to steal sensitive data (customer data, payment information, admin credentials), deface the website, inject malware, or use the server for further malicious activities.
**Magento 2 Component Affected:** Magento Core, specifically components handling data deserialization, potentially within modules related to session management, form processing, or API handling.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Immediately Apply Magento Security Patches:**  Prioritize and promptly install all security patches released by Adobe for Magento 2. These patches frequently address critical unserialize vulnerabilities.
*   **Upgrade Magento Version:** Keep Magento 2 updated to the latest stable version, as newer versions incorporate security improvements and may mitigate older deserialization issues.
*   **Code Audits Focusing on Deserialization:** Conduct focused code audits of Magento core and custom modules, specifically searching for instances of `unserialize()` and related functions to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Magento Rules:** Implement a WAF configured with Magento-specific rulesets to detect and block malicious requests attempting to exploit unserialize vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Magento Core Modules](./threats/sql_injection_in_magento_core_modules.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Magento 2 core modules where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or parameterized when constructing SQL queries. By injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, API parameters, or other data entry points, they can manipulate database queries executed by Magento.
**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, and potential denial of service. Attackers can bypass security checks to access sensitive database information (customer data, admin credentials, product details), modify or delete critical data, or potentially gain control of the database server.
**Magento 2 Component Affected:** Magento Core Modules, specifically those that interact with the database using raw SQL queries or improperly utilize Magento's ORM, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly Adhere to Magento ORM Best Practices:** Enforce the use of Magento's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interactions.  Utilize ORM features like prepared statements and data filtering to prevent SQL injection. Avoid direct raw SQL queries wherever possible.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Even with ORM):**  Even when using the ORM, rigorously validate and sanitize all user inputs before they are used in database queries or ORM operations.
*   **Regular Security Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security scans and penetration testing specifically targeting SQL injection vulnerabilities within the Magento 2 application, including core modules and customizations.
*   **Database User Privilege Restriction:**  Configure database user accounts used by Magento with the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to minimize the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Magento Core UI Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_magento_core_ui_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers vulnerabilities in Magento 2 core UI components (templates, JavaScript, admin panels) that allow them to inject malicious JavaScript code. This injected code executes in the browsers of other users (administrators or customers) when they interact with the affected Magento pages.
**Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover (including admin accounts), theft of sensitive data (customer information, admin session tokens), website defacement, and potential malware distribution to website visitors.
**Magento 2 Component Affected:** Magento Core UI Components, including but not limited to: Layout XML, PHTML templates, JavaScript modules, and Admin Panel interfaces that handle and display user-provided or dynamic content without proper output encoding.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement Robust Output Encoding Throughout Magento:**  Enforce strict output encoding for all dynamic content displayed by Magento, utilizing Magento's built-in escaping functions (e.g., `escapeHtml`, `escapeJs`) in PHTML templates and JavaScript.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration:** Implement and rigorously configure a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly limiting the impact of XSS attacks by preventing execution of inline scripts and restricting allowed script sources.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Static Analysis for XSS:** Conduct regular security audits and utilize static analysis tools specifically designed to detect XSS vulnerabilities within Magento 2 templates, JavaScript code, and custom modules.
*   **Magento Security Updates and UI Component Patches:**  Keep Magento 2 core and its UI libraries updated with the latest security patches, as these often address newly discovered XSS vulnerabilities in core components.
