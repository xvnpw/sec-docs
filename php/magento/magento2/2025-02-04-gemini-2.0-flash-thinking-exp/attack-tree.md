## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthenticated_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a known vulnerability in the Magento 2 core code that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server without needing to authenticate.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker identifies a publicly disclosed RCE vulnerability in a specific Magento 2 version.
    *   They craft a malicious request targeting the vulnerable endpoint or functionality. This request could be through HTTP, API calls, or other exposed interfaces.
    *   The malicious request exploits the vulnerability, allowing the attacker to inject and execute code on the Magento server.
    *   This could involve techniques like:
        *   Insecure deserialization of PHP objects.
        *   File upload vulnerabilities allowing execution of uploaded files.
        *   Exploiting flaws in input validation or sanitization in core functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Magento 2 server, allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal sensitive data (customer data, financial information, admin credentials).
    *   Modify website content and functionality.
    *   Install backdoors for persistent access.
    *   Use the server for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into data stored within the Magento 2 application (e.g., database), which is then executed in the browsers of users who view this data.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker finds input fields or functionalities where user-supplied data is stored and displayed without proper sanitization. Common areas include:
        *   Product descriptions.
        *   Customer reviews.
        *   CMS blocks.
        *   Admin configurations (e.g., email templates).
    *   Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into these fields.
    *   When other users (including admins or customers) view pages containing this stored data, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in their browsers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account takeover (stealing session cookies, credentials).
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of website content.
    *   Information theft from the user's browser.
    *   Spreading malware to users.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (SQLi) in Magento Core Queries](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__sqli__in_magento_core_queries.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Magento 2 core code where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to manipulate the database queries.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker identifies input parameters (e.g., search terms, product filters, URL parameters) that are used in SQL queries within Magento core functionalities.
    *   They craft malicious input containing SQL syntax to modify the intended query logic.
    *   Magento executes the modified SQL query, which can allow the attacker to:
        *   Bypass authentication and authorization.
        *   Extract sensitive data from the database (customer data, admin credentials, financial information).
        *   Modify or delete data in the database.
        *   In some cases, even execute operating system commands on the database server (depending on database server configuration).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Database compromise and data breach.
    *   Loss of data integrity.
    *   Potential full system compromise if database access is further exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Known Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/known_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in third-party Magento 2 extensions that are installed on the application.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker identifies installed third-party extensions on the target Magento 2 application (often through publicly accessible information or fingerprinting techniques).
    *   They research known vulnerabilities for these specific extensions and versions. Public databases and security advisories are common sources.
    *   If a vulnerable extension is found, the attacker uses available exploits or crafts their own to target the vulnerability.
    *   Extension vulnerabilities can range from simple XSS to critical RCE or SQLi, depending on the nature of the flaw in the extension's code.
*   **Impact:** Impact depends on the type of vulnerability in the extension, but can range from:
    *   XSS and client-side attacks.
    *   Information disclosure.
    *   SQL Injection and database compromise.
    *   Remote Code Execution and full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/brute-forcedictionary_attack_on_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attempting to guess admin panel login credentials by systematically trying a large number of possible usernames and passwords.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker targets the Magento 2 admin panel login page.
    *   They use automated tools to try a list of common usernames and passwords (dictionary attack) or systematically try all combinations of characters within a certain length (brute-force attack).
    *   If weak passwords are used or if there are no account lockout mechanisms, the attacker may successfully guess valid admin credentials.
*   **Impact:** Gain access to the Magento 2 admin panel, allowing the attacker to:
    *   Full control over the Magento store and its data.
    *   Modify website content and functionality.
    *   Access and steal sensitive data.
    *   Install malicious extensions or code.
    *   Create new admin accounts for persistent access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Publicly Exposed Admin Panel](./attack_tree_paths/publicly_exposed_admin_panel.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The Magento 2 admin panel is accessible directly from the public internet without any access restrictions (e.g., IP whitelisting, VPN).
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker simply accesses the admin panel URL (often `/admin` or a custom admin path if known) from the public internet.
    *   Because the admin panel is publicly accessible, it becomes a target for all types of attacks, including:
        *   Brute-force attacks on admin credentials.
        *   Exploiting authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   Targeting known vulnerabilities in the admin panel itself.
*   **Impact:** Significantly increases the attack surface of the Magento 2 application, making all admin panel related attacks much easier to perform.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Outdated Magento Versions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_outdated_magento_versions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting a Magento 2 installation that is running an outdated version and has not been patched for known security vulnerabilities.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker identifies the Magento 2 version of the target application (often through website fingerprinting or error messages).
    *   They check public vulnerability databases and security advisories for known vulnerabilities affecting that specific Magento version.
    *   If known vulnerabilities exist, the attacker uses readily available exploits or crafts their own to target these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Impact depends on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version, but can range from:
    *   Information disclosure.
    *   XSS and client-side attacks.
    *   SQL Injection and database compromise.
    *   Remote Code Execution and full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Web Server Writable Sensitive Files](./attack_tree_paths/web_server_writable_sensitive_files.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigured file permissions that allow the web server user to write to sensitive files within the Magento 2 installation directory.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker identifies files or directories within the Magento 2 installation that are writable by the web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`, `nginx`).
    *   Sensitive files that are often targeted include:
        *   Configuration files (`env.php`, `config.php`).
        *   PHP files (for code injection).
        *   Web server configuration files (if accessible).
    *   Attacker exploits this write access to:
        *   Modify configuration files to gain access or change application behavior.
        *   Inject malicious PHP code into existing PHP files or create new malicious PHP files for execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code injection and Remote Code Execution.
    *   Disclosure of sensitive configuration data (credentials, API keys).
    *   Full compromise of the Magento 2 application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Publicly Accessible APIs without Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/publicly_accessible_apis_without_authentication.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Magento 2 APIs that are exposed to the public internet without proper authentication or authorization mechanisms.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Attacker identifies publicly accessible Magento 2 APIs (e.g., REST or GraphQL endpoints).
    *   They analyze these APIs to understand their functionalities and identify any lack of authentication or authorization checks.
    *   If APIs are insecurely configured, the attacker can:
        *   Access sensitive data through the APIs without proper credentials.
        *   Perform unauthorized actions through the APIs (e.g., modify data, place orders, delete records).
        *   Potentially exploit vulnerabilities within the API endpoints themselves.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches through unauthorized API access.
    *   Unauthorized modification or deletion of data.
    *   Abuse of API functionalities for malicious purposes.
    *   Potential for further exploitation if API vulnerabilities exist.
