# Attack Surface Analysis for magento/magento2

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Core Modules](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_core_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters processed by Magento's core modules, leading to unauthorized database access.
    *   **Magento 2 Contribution:** Magento 2's complex codebase and database interactions within core modules increase SQL injection vulnerability potential if input validation is insufficient.
    *   **Example:** Malicious SQL code injected via a product search field to bypass authentication and extract customer data.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Website Defacement, Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs in core modules.
        *   Use Magento's input validation and parameterized queries.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing.
        *   Promptly apply Magento security patches and updates.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
        *   Use principle of least privilege for database access.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Templates and Input Fields](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_templates_and_input_fields.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into Magento pages, executed in users' browsers, leading to session hijacking and account takeover.
    *   **Magento 2 Contribution:** Magento's PHTML templates and numerous input fields create XSS opportunities if output encoding and input sanitization are lacking.
    *   **Example:** Malicious JavaScript injected into a product review, stealing session cookies of users viewing the product page.
    *   **Impact:** Account Takeover, Session Hijacking, Website Defacement, Phishing Attacks, Malware Distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Properly encode all output data in PHTML templates using Magento's escaping functions.
        *   Sanitize user inputs to neutralize malicious scripts.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   Regular security scans for XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Educate developers on secure coding practices.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Input Validation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__via_input_validation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit input validation flaws to execute arbitrary code on the Magento server, gaining full system control.
    *   **Magento 2 Contribution:** Magento's handling of user data, especially in file uploads and image processing, can lead to RCE if vulnerabilities exist.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting an image upload vulnerability in an extension to upload a malicious image and execute code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full System Compromise, Data Breach, Website Defacement, Denial of Service, Malware Installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict input validation for all user-provided data, especially file uploads.
        *   Secure file handling practices.
        *   Promptly apply Magento security patches and updates.
        *   Code reviews and static analysis for RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   Principle of least privilege for server processes.
        *   Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party Magento extensions can be exploited to compromise the Magento installation.
    *   **Magento 2 Contribution:** Magento's extension ecosystem introduces a large attack surface due to varying security quality of third-party code.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable extension allows attackers to bypass authentication and steal customer credit card information.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach, Website Defacement, Malware Distribution, Account Takeover, Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully select extensions from reputable developers.
        *   Regularly update all installed extensions.
        *   Security audits of critical extensions.
        *   Minimize extension usage.
        *   Use extension security scanners.
        *   Monitor security news for extension vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Magento Configuration (Debug Mode, Weak Passwords, Disabled Security Features)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_magento_configuration__debug_mode__weak_passwords__disabled_security_features_.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Magento settings create vulnerabilities and expose sensitive information.
    *   **Magento 2 Contribution:** Magento's extensive configuration options, if not secured, can lead to weaknesses like debug mode in production or weak admin credentials.
    *   **Example:** Debug mode left enabled revealing server paths and database information, or default admin credentials allowing easy admin access.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Unauthorized Access, Account Takeover, Website Defacement, Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Conduct a thorough security review of Magento configuration.
        *   Disable debug mode in production.
        *   Enforce strong admin passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
        *   Secure file permissions.
        *   Regular security audits including configuration checks.
        *   Follow Magento security hardening guides.

## Attack Surface: [REST API Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/rest_api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication in Magento's REST API to gain unauthorized access to API endpoints and data.
    *   **Magento 2 Contribution:** Magento 2's REST API can be vulnerable to authentication bypass if token validation or authorization logic is flawed.
    *   **Example:** Bypassing REST API token validation to access sensitive customer data or perform admin actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach, Unauthorized Data Modification, Account Takeover, System Abuse.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust API authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0).
        *   Regular security audits of API endpoints and authentication logic.
        *   Input validation and sanitization for API requests.
        *   Rate limiting and API security best practices.
        *   Keep Magento core updated with security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Magento Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_magento_version.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated Magento 2 version exposes the application to known, unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Magento 2 Contribution:** Failure to apply Magento security patches leaves the system vulnerable to exploits targeting known vulnerabilities in older versions.
    *   **Example:** Exploiting a known vulnerability in an outdated Magento version to compromise stores running that version.
    *   **Impact:** Data Breach, Website Defacement, Malware Distribution, Account Takeover, Denial of Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
