## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: `[!!!Gain Unauthorized Administrative Access!!!]`](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node___!!!gain_unauthorized_administrative_access!!!__.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker.  Achieving this node means complete compromise of the Magento 2 administrative interface.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Full control over the store, including customer data, orders, configuration, and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Consequences:** Data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, defacement, service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: `[***Compromise Magento Extensions/Themes***] -> [***Vulnerable Extension***]`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path___compromise_magento_extensionsthemes__-__vulnerable_extension__.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path represents the exploitation of security flaws within third-party Magento extensions.
*   **`[***Compromise Magento Extensions/Themes***]` (Parent Node):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker targets weaknesses in installed extensions to gain a foothold in the system.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - Due to the large number of available extensions and the varying levels of security diligence among developers.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High - Depends on the specific vulnerability within the extension.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Requires vulnerability scanning, code review, and potentially intrusion detection.

*   **`[***Vulnerable Extension***]` (Child Node):**
    *   **Description:** A specific extension contains a security flaw (e.g., RCE, SQL injection, XSS) that can be exploited.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - Given the parent node's high likelihood.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High - Depends on the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from minor information disclosure to complete system compromise (RCE).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - If a public exploit exists, the effort is very low.  Otherwise, it depends on the complexity of the vulnerability.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate - Public exploits require minimal skill.  Discovering and exploiting new vulnerabilities requires more skill.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Requires proactive vulnerability scanning, code analysis, and potentially intrusion detection system (IDS) monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: `[Leverage Magento Configuration Weaknesses] -> [***Weak/Default Admin Credentials***]`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path___leverage_magento_configuration_weaknesses__-__weakdefault_admin_credentials__.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This path involves the attacker gaining administrative access by exploiting weak or default administrator passwords.

*   **`[Leverage Magento Configuration Weaknesses]` (Parent Node):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker takes advantage of insecure configurations within the Magento 2 installation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - Depends on the diligence of the administrator in securing the installation.
    *   **Impact:** Varies - Depends on the specific configuration weakness.
    *   **Effort:** Varies - Depends on the specific weakness.
    *   **Skill Level:** Varies - From Script Kiddie to Advanced.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies - From Very Easy to Hard.

*   **`[***Weak/Default Admin Credentials***]` (Child Node):**
    *   **Description:** The administrator account uses an easily guessable password (e.g., "admin," "password123") or the default credentials provided by Magento.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Unfortunately, still a common issue.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Grants full administrative access to the attacker.
    *   **Effort:** Very Low - Simple guessing or using readily available password lists.
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium - Failed login attempts can be logged and monitored.  Rate limiting and account lockouts can hinder brute-force attempts.

* **Sub-Attacks under Weak/Default Credentials:**
    *   **Brute Force:**
        *   **Description:** Automated attempts to guess the password by trying many combinations.
        *   **Likelihood:** High - A common attack method.
        *   **Impact:** Very High (if successful).
        *   **Effort:** Low - Automated tools are readily available.
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with rate limiting and account lockout).
    *   **Phishing:**
        *   **Description:** Tricking the administrator into revealing their credentials through deceptive emails or websites.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (if successful).
        *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires crafting convincing phishing campaigns.
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires user awareness and email security.
    *   **Guessing:**
        *   **Description:** Manually trying common passwords or passwords based on publicly available information.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low - Less effective than brute-forcing.
        *   **Impact:** Very High (if successful).
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Failed login attempts can be logged.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node (within a High-Risk Path): `[Dependency Confusion]`](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__within_a_high-risk_path____dependency_confusion__.md)

* **Description:** Although not marked as a high-risk *path* on its own due to a currently lower likelihood, Dependency Confusion is a *critical node* because of its potential impact.
* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Increasingly common, but requires specific conditions)
* **Impact:** Very High (RCE, complete system compromise)
* **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires research and potentially custom exploit development)
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
* **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires monitoring package repositories and build processes)
