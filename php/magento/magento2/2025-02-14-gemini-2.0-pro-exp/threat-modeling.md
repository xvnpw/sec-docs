# Threat Model Analysis for magento/magento2

## Threat: [Admin Panel Takeover via Weak Admin Session Management](./threats/admin_panel_takeover_via_weak_admin_session_management.md)

*   **Threat:** Admin Panel Takeover via Weak Admin Session Management

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses *inherent* to Magento's session handling *after* a legitimate admin login. This isn't a simple brute-force; it targets Magento's specific implementation.  Examples include: predicting Magento-generated session IDs (if the random number generator is weak), hijacking sessions due to flaws in how Magento handles cookies (even with HTTPS, if Magento's cookie settings are insecure), or exploiting vulnerabilities in Magento's interaction with its configured session storage (database, Redis, Memcached – if *Magento's code* for interacting with these is flawed).
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the store: data theft, defacement, malware injection, and disruption of service. Full administrative control is obtained.
    *   **Magento 2 Component Affected:** `Magento\Backend\Model\Auth\Session`, session storage configuration *as handled by Magento code* (database interaction, Redis/Memcached client libraries used by Magento), potentially core Magento cookie handling (`Magento\Framework\Stdlib\Cookie`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure HTTPS is correctly configured for *all* admin panel access (including subdomains and redirects) – this is foundational, but Magento's secure cookie settings are also crucial.
        *   Configure strong session security settings *within Magento* (e.g., `Admin Session Lifetime`, `Use SID on Frontend`, `Cookie Lifetime`, `Cookie Path`, `Cookie Domain`, `Use HTTP Only`, `Use Secure Cookies`).  These settings directly impact Magento's session handling.
        *   Securely configure any external session storage mechanisms (Redis, Memcached) – but focus on *Magento's* secure use of these.
        *   Implement regular security audits of *both* server and *Magento's* configuration.
        *   Monitor server logs *and Magento's logs* for suspicious session activity.
        *   Regularly update Magento to the latest version to patch any session-related vulnerabilities *in Magento's code*.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Unprotected Core API Endpoint](./threats/data_leakage_via_unprotected_core_api_endpoint.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage via Unprotected Core API Endpoint

    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits an unprotected or poorly secured *core* Magento API endpoint. This is *not* about a custom or third-party API; it's about a vulnerability in Magento's own built-in API controllers or their interaction with the Webapi framework.  The attacker can access sensitive data without proper credentials *due to a flaw in Magento's API security*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of customer data (PII, order history, potentially payment details if stored insecurely – even if payment details *shouldn't* be stored, a vulnerability in Magento's handling could expose them), internal system information, or other sensitive data accessible through the *core* API.
    *   **Magento 2 Component Affected:** `Magento\Webapi`, *core* API controllers (e.g., `Magento\Customer\Api\CustomerRepositoryInterface`, `Magento\Sales\Api\OrderRepositoryInterface`), and the underlying models and resource models they interact with. The vulnerability lies within Magento's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure *all core* Magento API endpoints are protected by strong authentication (OAuth 2.0 is recommended, and Magento provides built-in support).  This requires proper configuration *within Magento*.
        *   Implement strict access control lists (ACLs) *within Magento* to limit API access based on user roles and permissions.  Magento's ACL system must be correctly used.
        *   Regularly audit API usage logs (Magento's logs) to detect unauthorized access attempts.
        *   Thoroughly test *all core* API endpoints for security vulnerabilities, even if they seem secure by default.  Penetration testing focused on Magento's API is crucial.
        *   Validate all input to *core* API endpoints to prevent injection attacks *that could bypass Magento's security*.
        *   Keep Magento updated to address any API-related security patches.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Vulnerability in Core Magento Code](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_vulnerability_in_core_magento_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Vulnerability in Core Magento Code

    *   **Description:** An attacker with *limited* access (e.g., a customer account, or a compromised low-privilege admin account) exploits a vulnerability *within Magento's core code* to gain higher privileges, potentially even full administrative access. This is *not* about a third-party extension; it's a flaw in Magento's own codebase, such as improper access control checks in a core controller or model, or a vulnerability in Magento's user management system.
    *   **Impact:** Escalation of privileges, potentially leading to complete site takeover and all the consequences that entails.
    *   **Magento 2 Component Affected:**  Potentially any core Magento component, but likely involves components related to user management (`Magento\User\Model\User`, `Magento\Authorization`), access control (`Magento\Framework\Authorization`), or core controllers/models that handle sensitive operations. The vulnerability is *within Magento itself*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Magento updated to the *absolute latest* version. This is the most critical mitigation for core code vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege, granting users *within Magento* only the minimum necessary permissions.  Configure Magento's roles and permissions carefully.
        *   Regularly review user accounts and permissions *within Magento's admin panel*.
        *   Implement strong input validation *throughout Magento's core code* (this is primarily Magento's responsibility, but custom code should also follow this principle).
        *   Thorough security audits and penetration testing focused on *Magento's core functionality* are essential to identify and address privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
