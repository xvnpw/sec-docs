## 4. System Overview

Magento 2 is a sophisticated, open-source e-commerce platform built on PHP, leveraging the Zend Framework principles. Its modular architecture facilitates extensive customization and the development of extensions. The platform offers a wide array of features, encompassing product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, order processing, customer relationship management (CRM), marketing automation, and reporting. Understanding this complexity is crucial for effective threat modeling.

## 5. Architectural Layers

Magento 2's architecture is structured into distinct layers, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. These layers are crucial for understanding where security controls should be implemented.

* **Presentation Layer:**  Manages user interaction through web browsers (frontend and admin) and APIs (REST and GraphQL). This includes themes, layouts, UI components (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), and API endpoints. Security considerations here include protection against XSS, CSRF, and API abuse.
* **Service Layer:**  Encapsulates business logic and provides data access through well-defined service contracts (interfaces). This layer acts as an abstraction, shielding the presentation layer from the underlying domain logic. Security here involves ensuring proper authorization and input validation before reaching the domain layer.
* **Domain Layer:**  Represents the core business entities (e.g., products, customers, orders, quotes) and their associated business rules and workflows. This layer is where core business logic resides, and security focuses on data integrity and consistent application of business rules.
* **Persistence Layer:**  Handles data storage and retrieval, primarily interacting with the database (typically MySQL). This layer is responsible for data integrity and security at the storage level. Security considerations include preventing SQL injection and ensuring data encryption.

## 6. Key Components

The following are key components within the Magento 2 platform, with a focus on their security implications:

* **Web Server:** (e.g., Apache, Nginx) -  Acts as the entry point for all web requests. Security involves proper configuration to prevent common web server vulnerabilities and control access.
* **PHP Interpreter:** Executes the Magento 2 application code. Security requires keeping the PHP version up-to-date with security patches and configuring it securely.
* **Magento Application:** The core codebase implementing the platform's functionality. This is the primary target for many application-level vulnerabilities.
* **Database Server:** (e.g., MySQL) - Stores all persistent data. Security involves strong access controls, encryption at rest, and regular backups.
* **Cache:** (e.g., Redis, Varnish) - Improves performance but can introduce security risks if not configured properly (e.g., data leakage, cache poisoning).
* **Search Engine:** (e.g., Elasticsearch) - Enables efficient product searching. Security considerations include preventing injection attacks and securing access to the search index.
* **Message Queue:** (e.g., RabbitMQ) - Facilitates asynchronous task processing. Security involves securing communication channels and preventing unauthorized message manipulation.
* **Admin Panel:** A powerful web-based interface for managing the store. This is a high-value target for attackers, requiring strong authentication and authorization controls.
* **Frontend:** The customer-facing web store. Security focuses on protecting customer data and preventing client-side attacks.
* **APIs:** (REST, GraphQL) - Allow external systems to interact with Magento 2. Security requires robust authentication, authorization, and input validation to prevent abuse.
* **Modules:**  Self-contained units of functionality. Custom modules can introduce vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
* **Themes:** Control the visual appearance. Vulnerable themes can be exploited for XSS attacks.
* **Payment Gateways:** Integrate with external payment processors. Security is paramount, requiring PCI DSS compliance and secure data transmission.
* **Shipping Carriers:** Integrate with external shipping providers. Security involves protecting sensitive shipping data.
