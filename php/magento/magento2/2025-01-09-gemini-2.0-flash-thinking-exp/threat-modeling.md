## Threat: [Lack of Proper API Authentication and Authorization](./threats/lack_of_proper_api_authentication_and_authorization.md)

**Description:** If Magento 2's core REST or GraphQL APIs *themselves* lack proper authentication and authorization mechanisms by default, attackers can gain unauthorized access to data or functionality exposed through these APIs.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, potential for denial-of-service attacks.

**Affected Component:** Magento 2 core REST (`Magento/Webapi`) and GraphQL (`Magento/GraphQl`) API modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce authentication by default for all sensitive API endpoints within the core.
*   Provide a flexible and secure authorization framework within the core for managing API access.
*   Offer clear guidance and tools for developers to implement secure authentication and authorization for custom APIs.

## Threat: [Data Injection Vulnerabilities in APIs (e.g., GraphQL)](./threats/data_injection_vulnerabilities_in_apis__e_g___graphql_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can craft malicious input to core Magento 2 API endpoints, such as GraphQL queries, *due to insufficient input validation or sanitization within the core API handling logic*, to extract more data than intended or to cause errors or unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for denial-of-service, data manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Magento 2 core GraphQL module (`Magento/GraphQl`), core API request handling.

**Risk Severity:** Medium *(Can be High depending on the sensitivity of exposed data and potential for exploitation)*

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the core API request handling logic.
*   Use parameterized queries or equivalent techniques within the core to prevent injection attacks.
*   Implement query complexity limits within the core GraphQL API.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into Magento's core template engine (e.g., through CMS blocks, emails, or custom layout XML) *if the core templating engine itself has vulnerabilities in how it handles and renders dynamic content*. This allows them to run arbitrary code, potentially gaining full control of the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches, website defacement.

**Affected Component:** Magento 2 core template engine (`Magento/Framework/View/Template/Php/File/Renderer`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the core template engine properly escapes and sanitizes all dynamic content by default.
*   Provide secure coding guidelines and tools for developers working with templates.
*   Regularly audit the core template rendering logic for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./threats/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)
