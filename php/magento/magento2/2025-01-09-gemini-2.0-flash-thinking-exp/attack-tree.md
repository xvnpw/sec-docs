## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Magento Vulnerabilities (e.g., Authentication Bypass)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_magento_vulnerabilities__e_g___authentication_bypass_.md)

*Attack Vector*: Magento, like any complex software, may contain publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs). Attackers actively scan for and exploit these vulnerabilities in unpatched Magento installations. Authentication bypass vulnerabilities are particularly critical as they allow attackers to gain access to the application without proper credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Specific CVEs in Magento Core](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_specific_cves_in_magento_core.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flaws in Third-Party Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flaws_in_third-party_extensions.md)

*Attack Vector*: As mentioned in the high-risk path, third-party extensions are a significant attack surface. Vulnerabilities in these extensions can provide various entry points for attackers, including authentication bypasses, SQL injection points, or remote code execution flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities in Extension Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_extension_authentication.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection Attacks (Magento Specific Context)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_attacks__magento_specific_context_.md)

*Attack Vector*:  As described in the high-risk path, improper handling of user input in SQL queries can lead to attackers injecting malicious SQL code to gain unauthorized access to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL Queries through Magento Input Fields (e.g., Product Search, Forms)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_queries_through_magento_input_fields__e_g___product_search__forms_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Payment Information Exploitation (Magento Payment Processing)](./attack_tree_paths/payment_information_exploitation__magento_payment_processing_.md)

*Attack Vector*: Magento processes sensitive payment information. Vulnerabilities in how Magento integrates with payment gateways or how it handles and stores payment data can be exploited. This can include exploiting flaws in the payment gateway APIs, intercepting communication between Magento and the payment gateway, or accessing stored payment information if it's not properly encrypted or tokenized. Successful exploitation can lead to the theft of credit card details and other sensitive financial data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Magento Payment Gateway Integrations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_magento_payment_gateway_integrations.md)

*Attack Vector*:  The integration between Magento and payment gateways is a critical area for security. Vulnerabilities in these integrations can allow attackers to intercept or manipulate payment transactions, or potentially gain access to sensitive payment data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration via Vulnerable Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration_via_vulnerable_extensions.md)

*Attack Vector*:  Similar to the unauthorized access scenario, vulnerable third-party extensions can inadvertently or intentionally expose sensitive data. Attackers can leverage the functionalities of these extensions, or exploit vulnerabilities within them, to extract sensitive information from the Magento application. This could involve accessing data that the extension has access to but shouldn't be publicly available, or exploiting flaws that allow arbitrary data retrieval.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Extension Functionality to Extract Sensitive Magento Data](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_extension_functionality_to_extract_sensitive_magento_data.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*Attack Vector*: RCE vulnerabilities are critical as they allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Magento application. This can be achieved through various means, including exploiting template engine vulnerabilities (injecting malicious code into PHTML files), exploiting unsafe file upload functionalities (uploading malicious PHP scripts), or through vulnerabilities in third-party extensions that allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful RCE grants the attacker complete control over the server and the Magento application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Magento Template Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_magento_template_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*Attack Vector*: Magento uses PHTML templates for rendering its frontend. If user-controlled data is not properly sanitized before being included in these templates, attackers can inject malicious code (e.g., PHP or JavaScript) that will be executed by the server or the user's browser, potentially leading to RCE or other client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into PHTML Templates (Magento Theming Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_phtml_templates__magento_theming_vulnerabilities_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe File Upload Functionality (Magento Media Storage)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe_file_upload_functionality__magento_media_storage_.md)

*Attack Vector*: If Magento allows users to upload files without proper validation and security measures, attackers can upload malicious executable files (like PHP scripts) to the server. If these uploaded files are accessible through the web server, attackers can then execute them, leading to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious PHP Files through Magento Media Gallery or other Upload Features](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_php_files_through_magento_media_gallery_or_other_upload_features.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_extensions.md)

*Attack Vector*:  Certain vulnerabilities in third-party extensions can directly lead to remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain immediate control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Extension Code to Execute Arbitrary Commands on the Server](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_extension_code_to_execute_arbitrary_commands_on_the_server.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Magento Admin Panel](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_magento_admin_panel.md)

*Attack Vector*: The Magento admin panel provides extensive control over the entire e-commerce platform. Attackers often target the admin panel to gain full control. This can be achieved through brute-force or credential stuffing attacks (attempting to guess admin credentials), or by exploiting vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to steal admin session cookies or perform actions on behalf of an administrator. Successful compromise of the admin panel allows attackers to modify data, install malicious extensions, or even gain RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force or Credential Stuffing Attacks (Targeting Magento Admin)](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_or_credential_stuffing_attacks__targeting_magento_admin_.md)

*Attack Vector*: Attackers may attempt to guess the login credentials for Magento administrator accounts. Brute-force attacks involve systematically trying different password combinations, while credential stuffing involves using lists of previously compromised usernames and passwords obtained from other breaches. Successful login provides full administrative control over the Magento application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attempt to Guess Admin Credentials Specific to Magento](./attack_tree_paths/attempt_to_guess_admin_credentials_specific_to_magento.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flaws in Third-Party Extensions leading to Unauthorized Access](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flaws_in_third-party_extensions_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

* Attack Vector: Magento's architecture relies heavily on third-party extensions for added functionality. These extensions are often developed by independent vendors and may contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can identify and exploit flaws in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of these extensions to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to the Magento application. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities, insecure coding practices, or a lack of proper input validation within the extension's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection Attacks leading to Stealing Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_attacks_leading_to_stealing_sensitive_data.md)

* Attack Vector: Magento is a database-driven application. If user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in SQL queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code. This injected code can allow them to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, modify existing data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server, leading to the theft of sensitive information such as customer details, order information, or administrative credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Payment Information Exploitation leading to Stealing Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/payment_information_exploitation_leading_to_stealing_sensitive_data.md)

* Attack Vector: Magento processes sensitive payment information. Vulnerabilities in how Magento integrates with payment gateways or how it handles and stores payment data can be exploited. This can include exploiting flaws in the payment gateway APIs, intercepting communication between Magento and the payment gateway, or accessing stored payment information if it's not properly encrypted or tokenized. Successful exploitation can lead to the theft of credit card details and other sensitive financial data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration via Vulnerable Extensions leading to Stealing Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration_via_vulnerable_extensions_leading_to_stealing_sensitive_data.md)

* Attack Vector:  Similar to the unauthorized access scenario, vulnerable third-party extensions can inadvertently or intentionally expose sensitive data. Attackers can leverage the functionalities of these extensions, or exploit vulnerabilities within them, to extract sensitive information from the Magento application. This could involve accessing data that the extension has access to but shouldn't be publicly available, or exploiting flaws that allow arbitrary data retrieval.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieving_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

* Attack Vector: RCE vulnerabilities are critical as they allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Magento application. This can be achieved through various means, including exploiting template engine vulnerabilities (injecting malicious code into PHTML files), exploiting unsafe file upload functionalities (uploading malicious PHP scripts), or through vulnerabilities in third-party extensions that allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful RCE grants the attacker complete control over the server and the Magento application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromising the Magento Admin Panel](./attack_tree_paths/compromising_the_magento_admin_panel.md)

* Attack Vector: The Magento admin panel provides extensive control over the entire e-commerce platform. Attackers often target the admin panel to gain full control.
