# Threat Model Analysis for googleapis/google-api-php-client

## Threat: [Insecure Credential Storage](./threats/insecure_credential_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to API keys, OAuth 2.0 client secrets, or refresh tokens that are stored insecurely and are used by the `google-api-php-client` to authenticate with Google APIs. This allows them to impersonate the application when making API calls through the library.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Google APIs, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of cloud resources, or service disruption orchestrated via the compromised application's API access.
*   **Affected Component:** OAuth client configuration within the `Google\Client` class and related methods for handling authentication.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize secure storage mechanisms like environment variables accessed by the PHP application.
    *   Employ dedicated secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with the application.
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the code or configuration files that are easily accessible.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive OAuth Scopes](./threats/overly_permissive_oauth_scopes.md)

*   **Description:** The application, when configuring the `google-api-php-client`, requests OAuth 2.0 scopes that grant broader access to Google resources than necessary. If the application is compromised, attackers can leverage the `google-api-php-client` with these excessive permissions to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Increased potential for data breaches, unauthorized access to user data, and unintended modifications to Google services due to the wider range of permissions granted through the library.
*   **Affected Component:** Methods within the `Google\Client` class used to define and request OAuth scopes (e.g., `addScope()`, `setScopes()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring OAuth scopes within the `google-api-php-client`.
    *   Request only the specific scopes required for the application's intended features.
    *   Regularly review and refine the requested scopes as the application evolves.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_known_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities within the `google-api-php-client` library itself. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or manipulating data in ways that trigger bugs in the library's code, leading to unauthorized actions when interacting with Google APIs.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the application, unauthorized access to Google APIs, or denial of service by crashing the application or overloading Google's services through the vulnerable library.
*   **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the `google-api-php-client` depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., request handling, response parsing, authentication logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE), High (for other exploits)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay informed about security advisories and updates for the `google-api-php-client` released by Google.
    *   Regularly update the library to the latest stable version as soon as security patches are available.
    *   Subscribe to security mailing lists or use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the library.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `google-api-php-client` relies on other PHP packages (dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited by attackers, indirectly affecting the security of the application's interaction with Google APIs through the `google-api-php-client`.
*   **Impact:** Similar to exploiting library vulnerabilities, this can lead to remote code execution, unauthorized access to Google APIs, or other security breaches stemming from the compromised dependency being used by the `google-api-php-client`.
*   **Affected Component:** Dependencies managed by Composer, such as `guzzlehttp/guzzle` for HTTP requests, which are used internally by the `google-api-php-client`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE in a dependency), High (for other exploits)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use dependency management tools (like Composer) to track and update dependencies of the `google-api-php-client`.
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `composer audit`.
    *   Keep dependencies updated to their latest stable versions to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in API Responses](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_api_responses.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist in how the `google-api-php-client` deserializes data received from Google APIs. An attacker could potentially manipulate API responses to inject malicious payloads that, when processed by the library, lead to code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the application.
*   **Affected Component:** Response parsing and handling logic within the `google-api-php-client`, particularly the components responsible for converting API responses (often JSON) into PHP objects.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `google-api-php-client` library updated to the latest version, as security updates often address deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   Be aware of any reported deserialization vulnerabilities specific to the library or its dependencies and apply necessary fixes promptly.
    *   While less direct control, ensure the underlying PHP environment has up-to-date serialization/deserialization handling to mitigate potential issues.
