# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure access to Google APIs from PHP applications.
  - Reliable and functional client library for PHP developers to integrate with Google services.
  - Maintaining the integrity and security of the `google-api-php-client` library to prevent supply chain attacks.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - API Keys and OAuth 2.0 Credentials: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to Google APIs and associated data.
  - Data Exchanged with Google APIs: Sensitivity depends on the specific API and application. Could range from low (public data) to high (sensitive user data, financial data, etc.).
  - Source Code of the Client Library: Medium sensitivity. Compromise could lead to injection of vulnerabilities or malicious code.
  - Build Artifacts (PHP Library Files): Medium to High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to distribution of malicious or vulnerable library versions.
