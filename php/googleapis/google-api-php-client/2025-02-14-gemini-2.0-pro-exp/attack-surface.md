# Attack Surface Analysis for googleapis/google-api-php-client

## Attack Surface: [Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/credential_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental or malicious disclosure of API keys, service account keys, or OAuth 2.0 client secrets.
    *   **`google-api-php-client` Contribution:** The library *requires* credentials to function.  The library's methods are the *mechanism* by which these credentials are used to authenticate with Google APIs.  While the library doesn't store credentials, its *usage* is the point of vulnerability if credentials are mishandled.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits a service account key file to a public GitHub repository, and that key is used via the `google-api-php-client` to access resources.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Google Cloud resources, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Hardcode Credentials:** Store credentials outside of the codebase (e.g., environment variables, secrets management services like Google Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
        *   **Use .gitignore:** Ensure credential files are explicitly excluded from version control.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant the minimum necessary permissions to service accounts and API keys.
        *   **Regular Rotation:** Implement a policy for regularly rotating API keys and service account keys.
        *   **Code Scanning:** Use static analysis tools to detect accidental credential inclusion in code.
        *   **Secrets Scanning:** Employ tools that scan repositories and environments for exposed secrets.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Scopes (OAuth 2.0)](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_scopes__oauth_2_0_.md)

*   **Description:** Requesting broader OAuth 2.0 scopes than necessary, granting the application excessive access to user data.
    *   **`google-api-php-client` Contribution:** The library provides the methods to *specify* and *request* these scopes during the OAuth 2.0 flow. The library is the *direct interface* for defining the scope of access.  The application *uses* the library to make this (potentially overly broad) request.
    *   **Example:** An application that only needs to read a user's email address requests full access to their Google Drive, using the `google-api-php-client` to set the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` scope.
    *   **Impact:** If the application's credentials or access tokens (obtained *via* the library) are compromised, the attacker gains access to a wider range of user data than necessary, increasing the potential damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Request only the *minimum* necessary scopes for the application's functionality.  Use the most restrictive scopes possible.
        *   **Scope Review:** Regularly review and justify the requested scopes. Document the purpose of each scope.
        *   **User Consent:** Clearly explain to users why specific scopes are required, in plain language.
        *   **Incremental Authorization:** Request additional scopes only when needed, rather than all at once during initial authorization.  Use the library's features to manage this incremental process.

## Attack Surface: [OAuth 2.0 Flow Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/oauth_2_0_flow_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the application's implementation of the OAuth 2.0 flow, allowing attackers to intercept authorization codes or access tokens.
    *   **`google-api-php-client` Contribution:** The library provides functions to facilitate the OAuth 2.0 flow (e.g. creating authorization URLs, exchanging codes for tokens). Vulnerabilities in *how* the application uses these functions can lead to compromise. The library is the *tool* used to implement the (potentially flawed) flow.
    *   **Example:** The application's redirect URI is vulnerable to an open redirect, allowing an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site after they grant authorization. The attacker then intercepts the authorization code that was intended for the `google-api-php-client`.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's Google account and resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate Redirect URI:** Strictly validate the redirect URI against a whitelist of allowed URIs. Ensure the redirect URI used with the `google-api-php-client` is correctly configured and protected.
        *   **Use State Parameter:** Use the `state` parameter in the OAuth 2.0 flow (supported by the library) to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
        *   **Secure Token Storage:** Store access tokens and refresh tokens securely (e.g., encrypted, with appropriate access controls) *after* they are obtained via the library.
        *   **Follow OAuth 2.0 Best Practices:** Adhere to the OAuth 2.0 specification and best practices for secure implementation, paying close attention to how the `google-api-php-client`'s functions are used.
