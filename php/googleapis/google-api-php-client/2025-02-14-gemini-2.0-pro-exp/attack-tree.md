## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Credentials !!!](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_credentials_!!!.md)

This is a *critical node* because it represents a major pathway to the attacker's goal. Compromising credentials often grants direct access to Google Cloud resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Leakage via Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_leakage_via_configuration.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 ***Hardcoded Credentials in Code/Config***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_hardcoded_credentials_in_codeconfig.md)

**Description:** Developers mistakenly include sensitive credentials (API keys, service account keys, etc.) directly within the application's source code or configuration files.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Effort:** Very Low
**Skill Level:** Novice
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
    *   Never store credentials in code or configuration files.
    *   Use environment variables or a secrets management service (e.g., Google Cloud Secret Manager).
    *   Implement pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline checks to scan for potential secrets.
    *   Use tools like `git-secrets` to prevent accidental commits of secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 ***Insecure Storage of Credentials***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_insecure_storage_of_credentials.md)

**Description:** Credentials are stored in a manner that is easily accessible to unauthorized individuals, such as unencrypted files, databases with weak security, or shared storage locations.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Novice
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
    *   Always encrypt credentials at rest and in transit.
    *   Use a dedicated secrets management service.
    *   Restrict access to credential storage locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Phishing/Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_phishingsocial_engineering.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3 ***Credential Stuffing***](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_credential_stuffing.md)

**Description:** Attackers use lists of compromised usernames and passwords (obtained from other data breaches) to attempt to gain access to Google Cloud accounts. This relies on users reusing the same password across multiple services.
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** High
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Novice
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, uniqueness).
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Monitor login attempts for suspicious patterns (e.g., high failure rates from a single IP address).
    *   Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   Use CAPTCHAs to deter automated attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_library_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 ***Outdated Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities***](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_outdated_dependencies_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `google-api-php-client` library, or one of its transitive dependencies, has a known security vulnerability that has not been patched. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the specific vulnerability)
**Effort:** Low (publicly known exploits are often available)
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Easy
**Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update all dependencies, including the `google-api-php-client` and its transitive dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `composer audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to automatically identify vulnerable packages.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process to track and remediate identified vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_input_validation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 ***Unescaped User Input to API Calls***](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_unescaped_user_input_to_api_calls.md)

**Description:** The application takes user-provided input and passes it directly to the `google-api-php-client` without proper sanitization or validation. This can allow attackers to inject malicious code or manipulate API requests.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
    *   Always validate and sanitize all user input before using it in any API call.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where applicable.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege â€“ only grant the application the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious input.
    *   Implement input validation at multiple layers (client-side, server-side).
