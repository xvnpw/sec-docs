Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Hardcoded Credentials in Code/Config" attack tree path, tailored for a development team using the `google-api-php-client` library.

## Deep Analysis: Hardcoded Credentials in `google-api-php-client` Applications

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks, implications, and mitigation strategies associated with hardcoding credentials within applications that utilize the `google-api-php-client` library.  We aim to provide actionable guidance to the development team to prevent this vulnerability.  This includes identifying specific code patterns and configurations that are particularly vulnerable.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the scenario where developers using the `google-api-php-client` library inadvertently embed credentials (API keys, service account keys, OAuth 2.0 client secrets) directly into:

*   **PHP Source Code:**  `.php` files, including classes, functions, and scripts.
*   **Configuration Files:**  `.ini`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.yaml`, or other configuration files used by the application or the `google-api-php-client` itself.
*   **Version Control System (e.g., Git):**  Committing files containing hardcoded credentials to a repository (public or private).
*   **Build Artifacts:**  Including credentials in compiled code, Docker images, or other deployment packages.

The analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities related to credential exposure through other means (e.g., phishing, social engineering, server compromise *not* resulting from hardcoded credentials).  It also excludes vulnerabilities within the `google-api-php-client` library itself, assuming the library is used as intended (without hardcoding).

**Methodology:**

This analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We'll examine how an attacker might exploit hardcoded credentials in the context of the `google-api-php-client`.
2.  **Code Review Patterns:**  We'll identify specific code snippets and configuration patterns that indicate hardcoded credentials.
3.  **Impact Analysis:**  We'll detail the potential consequences of successful exploitation.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  We'll provide concrete, actionable steps to prevent and remediate this vulnerability, going beyond the high-level mitigations listed in the original attack tree.
5.  **Tooling Recommendations:**  We'll suggest specific tools and techniques to automate the detection and prevention of hardcoded credentials.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1: Hardcoded Credentials

#### 2.1 Threat Modeling

An attacker exploiting hardcoded credentials in a `google-api-php-client` application could gain unauthorized access to Google Cloud services.  The attack vector typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Discovery:**
    *   **Public Repository:** The attacker scans public code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for exposed credentials.  Tools like `trufflehog`, `gitrob`, and GitHub's own secret scanning are used for this.
    *   **Compromised Server:** If the application server is compromised (through a *separate* vulnerability), the attacker can access the source code and configuration files.
    *   **Decompiled Code:** If the application is distributed in a compiled or packaged form, the attacker might decompile it to extract credentials.
    *   **Accidental Disclosure:**  Credentials might be accidentally exposed in logs, error messages, or debugging output.

2.  **Exploitation:** Once the attacker obtains the credentials (e.g., a service account key JSON file), they can use the `google-api-php-client` (or any other Google Cloud SDK) to authenticate and interact with Google Cloud services as if they were the legitimate application.

3.  **Impact:** The attacker can then perform actions based on the permissions granted to the compromised credentials.  This could range from reading sensitive data (e.g., Cloud Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets) to modifying or deleting resources (e.g., Compute Engine instances, Cloud SQL databases), or even launching new resources to incur costs.

#### 2.2 Code Review Patterns (Vulnerable Examples)

Here are specific examples of how credentials might be *incorrectly* hardcoded when using the `google-api-php-client`:

**Example 1: Hardcoded Service Account Key (JSON)**

```php
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Google\Client();
$client->setAuthConfig([
    'type' => 'service_account',
    'project_id' => 'your-project-id',
    'private_key_id' => 'your-private-key-id',
    'private_key' => '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----',
    'client_email' => 'your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com',
    'client_id' => 'your-client-id',
    'auth_uri' => 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth',
    'token_uri' => 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token',
    'auth_provider_x509_cert_url' => 'https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs',
    'client_x509_cert_url' => '...',
]);

// Use the client to access Google Cloud services...
$storage = new Google\Service\Storage($client);
// ...
?>
```

**Example 2: Hardcoded API Key**

```php
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Google\Client();
$client->setDeveloperKey('AIzaSyCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'); // Hardcoded API Key

// Use the client to access Google Cloud services...
$youtube = new Google\Service\YouTube($client);
// ...
?>
```

**Example 3: Hardcoded Credentials in a Configuration File (.ini)**

```ini
; config.ini
[google]
api_key = AIzaSyCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
service_account_key = {"type": "service_account", ... }
```

```php
<?php
// config.php
$config = parse_ini_file('config.ini', true);
$client = new Google\Client();
$client->setDeveloperKey($config['google']['api_key']); // Or setAuthConfig()
// ...
?>
```
**Example 4: Hardcoded in docker-compose.yml**
```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: my-php-app
    environment:
      - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={"type": "service_account", ... }
```

#### 2.3 Impact Analysis

The impact of hardcoded credentials being compromised is severe and multifaceted:

*   **Data Breaches:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Google Cloud services (e.g., customer data, financial records, intellectual property).
*   **Data Loss/Corruption:**  Attackers could delete or modify data, leading to data loss or corruption.
*   **Service Disruption:**  Attackers could shut down or disrupt services, causing downtime and impacting users.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Attackers could launch new resources, incurring significant costs.  They could also steal data and sell it or use it for extortion.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach or service disruption can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to fines, lawsuits, and regulatory penalties (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Compromise of Other Systems:**  If the compromised credentials have access to other systems (e.g., through cross-project service accounts), the attacker could pivot to those systems.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies go beyond the basic recommendations and provide specific guidance for `google-api-php-client` users:

1.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Store credentials in environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `API_KEY`).
    *   Access these variables within your PHP code using `getenv()`:

    ```php
    <?php
    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

    $client = new Google\Client();
    $credentialsPath = getenv('GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS');
    if ($credentialsPath) {
        $client->setAuthConfig($credentialsPath); // Path to the JSON file
    } else {
        $apiKey = getenv('API_KEY');
        if ($apiKey) {
            $client->setDeveloperKey($apiKey);
        } else {
            // Handle the case where no credentials are provided
            throw new Exception('No Google Cloud credentials found.');
        }
    }

    // ...
    ?>
    ```
    *   Set environment variables in your server's configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx, systemd) or in your container environment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).  **Crucially, avoid setting environment variables directly in your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml if those files are committed to version control.** Use secrets management features of your container orchestration platform.

2.  **Google Cloud Secret Manager:**
    *   Store credentials as secrets in Google Cloud Secret Manager.
    *   Use the Secret Manager API (with appropriate IAM permissions) to retrieve the secrets within your application.  The `google-api-php-client` can be used to interact with the Secret Manager API.
    *   This is the recommended approach for production environments.

3.  **Instance Metadata (for Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions):**
    *   If your application runs on Google Cloud compute services, leverage the instance metadata service to obtain credentials automatically.
    *   Attach a service account to your instance/pod/function.
    *   The `google-api-php-client` will automatically detect and use these credentials if you don't explicitly provide any:

    ```php
    <?php
    require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

    $client = new Google\Client(); // No credentials provided!
    // The client will automatically use the instance metadata service.

    // ...
    ?>
    ```
    *   This is the *most secure* option for applications running within Google Cloud.

4.  **Workload Identity Federation (for GKE):**
    *   For applications running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), use Workload Identity Federation to bind Kubernetes service accounts to Google Cloud service accounts.  This eliminates the need to manage service account keys.

5.  **Pre-Commit Hooks (git-secrets):**
    *   Install `git-secrets` and configure it to scan your code for potential secrets *before* you commit.
    *   `git-secrets` uses regular expressions to identify patterns that look like credentials.
    *   This prevents accidental commits of secrets to your repository.

6.  **CI/CD Pipeline Checks:**
    *   Integrate secret scanning into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
    *   Use tools like `trufflehog`, `gitleaks`, or cloud provider-specific secret scanners (e.g., GitHub's built-in secret scanning).
    *   These checks should run on every code push and pull request.

7.  **Code Reviews:**
    *   Mandate code reviews for all changes, with a specific focus on identifying hardcoded credentials.
    *   Educate developers on secure coding practices and the risks of hardcoded credentials.

8.  **Regular Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of your codebase and infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities, including hardcoded credentials.

9.  **Least Privilege:**
    *   Ensure that service accounts and API keys have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks.  Avoid using overly permissive credentials.

10. **Credential Rotation:**
    * Regularly rotate API keys and service account keys. This limits the impact if a credential is ever compromised.

#### 2.5 Tooling Recommendations

*   **`git-secrets`:**  Pre-commit hook for preventing accidental commits of secrets.  (https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
*   **`trufflehog`:**  Scans Git repositories for high-entropy strings and secrets. (https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog)
*   **`gitleaks`:**  Another popular Git secret scanner. (https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)
*   **GitHub Secret Scanning:**  Built-in secret scanning for GitHub repositories. (https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning)
*   **Google Cloud Secret Manager:**  Securely store and manage secrets in Google Cloud. (https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)
*   **PHP_CodeSniffer/Security-Audit:** Can be configured with custom rules to detect hardcoded credentials. (https://github.com/FloeDesignTechnologies/phpcs-security-audit)
*   **Psalm/Phan (Static Analysis):** While not specifically designed for secret detection, static analysis tools can sometimes flag suspicious string assignments that might indicate hardcoded credentials.
