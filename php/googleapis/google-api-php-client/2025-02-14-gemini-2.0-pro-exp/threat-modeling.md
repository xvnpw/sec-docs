# Threat Model Analysis for googleapis/google-api-php-client

## Threat: [Credential Theft and Abuse (Direct Library Impact)](./threats/credential_theft_and_abuse__direct_library_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's Google API credentials *due to vulnerabilities or misconfigurations directly related to how the library handles or stores credentials*. This is distinct from general credential theft (e.g., from a compromised server) and focuses on library-specific issues. Examples include:
    *   **Library Bug:** A hypothetical vulnerability in the `google-api-php-client` that leaks credentials during processing or storage.
    *   **Misconfiguration of Library-Specific Storage:** If the library *were* to offer a built-in (but insecure) credential storage mechanism, and the developer used it incorrectly. (Note: The library generally *doesn't* do this, relying on external secure storage, but this highlights the *direct* involvement).
    *   **Dependency Vulnerability Affecting Credential Handling:** A vulnerability in a direct dependency of `google-api-php-client` that impacts how credentials are processed or transmitted.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data in Google services.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Attacker can modify or delete data.
    *   **Service Disruption:** Attacker can consume API quotas.
    *   **Financial Loss:** Potential for significant charges if API usage is billed.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of user trust and legal consequences.
*   **Affected Component:** `Google\Client` (credential handling mechanisms, `setAuthConfig()`, `setAccessToken()`, and related methods). Any part of the library involved in processing or storing credentials, *including its direct dependencies*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Rely on Library for Primary Credential Storage:** The library is *not* a secrets management solution. Always use external, secure storage (secrets manager, environment variables *with extreme caution*, encrypted config files).
    *   **Keep Library Updated:**  Immediately apply updates to `google-api-php-client` and its dependencies to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **`composer audit`:** Regularly run `composer audit` to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Follow Best Practices for External Storage:**  Regardless of the storage method chosen (secrets manager, etc.), follow all security best practices for *that* method. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant the service account or OAuth 2.0 client ID only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Key Rotation:** Rotate service account keys and API keys.
    *   **Monitor for Library Vulnerability Announcements:** Stay informed about security advisories related to the library and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Library Tampering (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/library_tampering__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `google-api-php-client` library itself or one of its *direct* dependencies *before* it's installed in the application. This is a classic supply chain attack. The attacker could:
    *   **Compromise Packagist:** Publish a malicious version of the library or a direct dependency to Packagist.
    *   **Compromise a Git Repository:** If the library or a dependency is pulled directly from a Git repository (less common, but possible), the attacker could compromise that repository.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Theft:** The modified library could intercept and steal API credentials.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** The library could send sensitive data to the attacker.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker could execute arbitrary code on the application server.
    *   **Backdoor Installation:** The attacker could install a backdoor.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire `google-api-php-client` library and its *direct* dependencies (as managed by Composer). Any function or class could be affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management (Composer):**
        *   **Use `composer.lock`:**  Always commit `composer.lock` to version control. This ensures that the *exact* same versions of dependencies are installed on every deployment.
        *   **`composer audit`:** Regularly run `composer audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Verify Package Sources:** Be extremely cautious about using unofficial or untrusted package sources. Stick to the official Packagist repository.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `google-api-php-client` and all its dependencies up-to-date.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM to detect unauthorized changes to library files *after* installation (this helps detect modifications *after* the initial install, which is a separate threat).
    *   **Vendor Directory Protection:** Ensure the `vendor` directory is protected from unauthorized write access *after* installation.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Library Errors (Direct Leakage)](./threats/information_disclosure_through_library_errors__direct_leakage_.md)

*   **Description:**  A vulnerability in the `google-api-php-client` itself causes it to leak sensitive information (e.g., parts of API keys, internal state) through error messages or logging *without* the application's intervention. This is distinct from the application *mishandling* errors; this is about the library *generating* the sensitive information in the error.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Partial Credential Exposure:** Attackers might gain partial information about API keys or other secrets.
    *   **System Information Disclosure:** Attackers gain information about the library's internal workings, potentially aiding in further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Error handling and logging mechanisms *within* the `google-api-php-client` itself.  Specifically, any code that generates error messages or log output.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Library Updated:**  This is the primary defense against library-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor for Library Vulnerability Announcements:** Stay informed about security advisories.
    *   **Review Library Code (if feasible):**  While not always practical, reviewing the library's error handling code (if open source) can help identify potential issues. This is a more advanced mitigation.
    *   **Application-Level Error Handling (as a secondary defense):** Even though this threat focuses on the library, robust application-level error handling can still help *mitigate* the impact by preventing the library's raw errors from being exposed directly to users or logged unsafely. This is a *secondary* defense, as the primary issue is the library's behavior.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Scopes (Configuration within the Library)](./threats/overly_permissive_scopes__configuration_within_the_library_.md)

*   **Description:** The application, through its configuration *of the `google-api-php-client`*, requests overly broad OAuth 2.0 scopes. While this is primarily an application configuration issue, it's directly tied to how the library is *used*. The threat is that the library is *configured* to request excessive permissions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Data Breach Scope:** If credentials are compromised, the attacker has access to a wider range of data.
    *   **Wider Range of Actions:** The attacker can perform more actions within Google services.
*   **Affected Component:** The OAuth 2.0 authorization flow and the configuration of scopes within the `Google\Client` object (e.g., when using `setScopes()`). This is about how the application *uses* the library's API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Request only the *minimum* necessary scopes. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Scope Justification:** Document the justification for each requested scope.
    *   **Regular Scope Review:** Periodically review and refine the requested scopes.
    *   **User Consent:** Ensure users are clearly informed about the requested scopes during the authorization flow (this is more about user experience and transparency, but it's related).
