Okay, let's create a design document for the Google API PHP Client library.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable PHP developers to easily access and integrate with Google services (e.g., Drive, YouTube, Calendar, etc.).
*   Provide a consistent and reliable interface for interacting with Google APIs.
*   Reduce the complexity of authentication, authorization, and request/response handling for developers.
*   Maintain compatibility with a wide range of PHP versions and environments.
*   Offer comprehensive documentation and support to facilitate adoption.
*   Provide open source library that can be used by anyone.
*   Library should be easy to install and use.

Business Risks:

*   Exposure of sensitive data (API keys, user data) due to improper usage or vulnerabilities in the library.
*   Service disruption or degradation due to bugs or inefficiencies in the library.
*   Compatibility issues with different PHP versions or server configurations.
*   Reputational damage due to security breaches or poor performance.
*   Legal and compliance risks related to data privacy and usage of Google services.
*   Lack of adoption due to complexity or poor documentation.
*   Vulnerabilities in dependencies.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization (described in library documentation and examples).
*   security control: API key support for simpler APIs (described in library documentation).
*   security control: HTTPS for all communication with Google APIs (enforced by the library).
*   security control: Input validation for API parameters (partially implemented within the library, but relies on developers to provide valid data).
*   security control: Code reviews and static analysis during development (implied by Google's development practices).
*   security control: Dependency management using Composer (specified in `composer.json`).
*   security control: Regular updates and security patches (managed by Google and the open-source community).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on developers to securely store and manage API keys and OAuth 2.0 credentials.
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (managed through Composer).
*   accepted risk: Limited control over the security of the underlying Google APIs.
*   accepted risk: Possibility of backward-incompatible changes due to updates in Google APIs.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement more robust input validation and sanitization within the library to prevent common injection vulnerabilities.
*   Provide clear guidance and examples for secure credential management, including best practices for storing API keys and OAuth tokens.
*   Integrate automated security testing (e.g., SAST, DAST) into the build process.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   Provide support for more secure authentication methods, such as service accounts with workload identity federation.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and authorization.
    *   Support API keys for simple API access.
    *   Provide mechanisms for securely storing and managing credentials.
    *   Support service accounts and workload identity federation.
*   Authorization:
    *   Enforce access control based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Implement granular authorization checks for specific API resources and actions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all input parameters to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Sanitize data to remove potentially harmful characters.
    *   Enforce data type and format restrictions.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication with Google APIs.
    *   Employ secure cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.

    GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    CI["CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    Composer["Composer"]
    SAST["SAST Tools"]
    DependencyCheck["Dependency Check Tools"]
    ContainerRegistry["Container Registry"]

    DeveloperPC -- pushes code --> GitHub
    GitHub -- triggers --> CI
    CI -- uses --> Composer
    Composer -- installs dependencies --> CI
    CI -- runs --> SAST
    CI -- runs --> DependencyCheck
    CI -- builds and pushes image --> ContainerRegistry
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer pushes code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub triggers the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI pipeline uses Composer to install project dependencies.
4.  The CI pipeline runs SAST tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
5.  The CI pipeline runs dependency check tools (e.g., Composer audit, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
6.  If all checks pass, the CI pipeline builds the Docker image and pushes it to the container registry.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Dependency management with Composer: `composer.json` and `composer.lock` ensure consistent and reproducible builds.
*   security control: SAST tools: Identify potential code vulnerabilities before deployment.
*   security control: Dependency check tools: Identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Secure build environment: The CI/CD pipeline runs in a secure and isolated environment.
*   security control: Image scanning: The container registry scans images for vulnerabilities.
