*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Storage of Google API Credentials
    *   **Description:** Sensitive credentials like service account private keys, OAuth 2.0 client secrets, or refresh tokens are stored in a way that is easily accessible to attackers.
    *   **How google-api-php-client contributes:** The library **requires** these credentials to authenticate and authorize API requests. If the application using the library doesn't handle credential storage securely, the library becomes a vector for exploiting this weakness.
    *   **Example:** Storing a service account JSON key directly in the application's codebase or in a configuration file without encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's access to Google APIs, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and resource manipulation within the associated Google Cloud project.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management services like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Google Cloud Secret Manager.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files.
        *   Encrypt sensitive credentials at rest if they must be stored locally.
        *   For OAuth 2.0, leverage the "Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)" for web applications and follow best practices for native/mobile apps.

*   **Attack Surface:** Misconfigured OAuth 2.0 Flows
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arise from improper implementation of the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow, allowing attackers to intercept or manipulate the authorization process.
    *   **How google-api-php-client contributes:** The library **provides functionalities to implement OAuth 2.0 flows**. Incorrect usage or lack of proper validation within the application using the library can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Not validating the `redirect_uri` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect the user to a malicious site after authorization and potentially steal the authorization code.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate the `redirect_uri` parameter against a predefined whitelist.
        *   Implement proper state management to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks during the OAuth flow.
        *   Use HTTPS for all communication during the OAuth flow.
        *   Avoid client-side storage of sensitive tokens if possible, opting for secure server-side session management.
