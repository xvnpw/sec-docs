# Threat Model Analysis for serbanghita/mobile-detect

## Threat: [User-Agent Spoofing (Impacting Security Decisions)](./threats/user-agent_spoofing__impacting_security_decisions_.md)

*   **Threat:** User-Agent Spoofing (Impacting Security Decisions)

    *   **Description:** The attacker deliberately modifies their browser's User-Agent string to impersonate a different device, operating system, or browser. This is done to directly influence the *output* of `mobile-detect`'s detection methods. The attacker's goal is to cause `mobile-detect` to return a *false positive or false negative* for a particular device/OS/browser check.
    *   **Impact:** If `mobile-detect`'s output is used directly in security-critical decisions (authentication, authorization, feature access), the attacker can bypass these controls. For example, if access to an administrative panel is granted based *solely* on `mobile-detect` identifying a "desktop" browser, spoofing a desktop User-Agent from a mobile device would grant unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** All methods within the `Mobile_Detect` class that rely on parsing the User-Agent string are affected: `is()`, `mobile()`, `tablet()`, `version()`, and all specific device/OS/browser detection methods. The core logic of the library is being manipulated.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (because it directly impacts security decisions *if* the library is misused in this way).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Trust User-Agent for Security:** This is the *crucial* mitigation. Do *not* use `mobile-detect`'s output as the *sole* basis for any security-related decision. The User-Agent is client-controlled and untrustworthy.
        *   **Layered Security:** Implement multiple, independent security checks. Combine User-Agent detection (for *convenience*, not security) with other factors like IP address reputation, multi-factor authentication, and behavioral analysis.
        *   **Input Validation (of Output):** Validate the *result* of `mobile-detect` against a known-good list of supported devices/browsers *if* you are using it for feature toggling (but *not* for security).

## Threat: [Undiscovered Vulnerability in `mobile-detect` (Leading to RCE or Severe DoS)](./threats/undiscovered_vulnerability_in__mobile-detect___leading_to_rce_or_severe_dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Undiscovered Vulnerability in `mobile-detect` (Leading to RCE or Severe DoS)

    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability within the `mobile-detect` library's code. This vulnerability could be a buffer overflow, a code injection flaw, or a particularly severe Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability that allows for more than just CPU exhaustion. The attacker crafts a malicious User-Agent string (or potentially other input, if the vulnerability exists in a less-common code path) to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although less likely in a library primarily focused on string parsing, a severe vulnerability *could* allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the worst-case scenario.
        *   **Severe Denial of Service (DoS):** A vulnerability could allow an attacker to completely crash the application or consume all server resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This goes beyond a simple ReDoS that slows things down; it would cause a complete outage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of the `Mobile_Detect` class, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. This could be in the core parsing logic, the regular expression handling, or even less-frequently used methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High (for severe DoS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Updates:** Upon discovery of a vulnerability, update `mobile-detect` to the patched version *immediately*. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Security Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) for any reports related to `mobile-detect` or its dependencies.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the absolute minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve RCE.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF *might* be able to detect and block some exploit attempts, even for unknown vulnerabilities, by recognizing common attack patterns. However, it's not a guaranteed solution.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to automatically scan your project's dependencies (including `mobile-detect`) for known vulnerabilities.
