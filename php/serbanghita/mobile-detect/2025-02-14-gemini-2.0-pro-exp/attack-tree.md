## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal: Inject False Device Data (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_inject_false_device_data__critical_node_.md)

*   **Tactic:** Header Injection (User-Agent) (HIGH-RISK)
    *   **Description:** The attacker modifies the `User-Agent` HTTP header to misrepresent the user's device, operating system, or browser. This is the most common and easily exploited attack vector.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **[A1] Spoof Mobile Device:**
            *   *Likelihood:* Very High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Very Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Very Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
            *   *Description:* The attacker sets the `User-Agent` to a string representing a common mobile device. This can trick the application into serving mobile-specific content, bypassing desktop-only security checks, or triggering other mobile-specific behavior.
        *   **[A2] Spoof Desktop Device:**
            *   *Likelihood:* Very High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Very Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Very Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
            *   *Description:* The attacker sets the `User-Agent` to a string representing a common desktop browser. This can bypass mobile-specific security features or trigger desktop-specific logic that may be less secure.
        *   **[A3] Spoof Specific OS/Version:**
            *   *Likelihood:* High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to High
            *   *Description:* The attacker sets the `User-Agent` to target a specific operating system or version. This could be used to exploit known vulnerabilities in that specific version or to trigger application logic that behaves differently for certain OS/version combinations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal: Exploit Logic Flaws in Application's Use of mobile-detect (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_exploit_logic_flaws_in_application's_use_of_mobile-detect__critical_node_.md)

*   **Tactic:** Exploit OS Detection Logic Flaws (HIGH-RISK)
    *   **Description:** The attacker leverages vulnerabilities in how the application *uses* the OS information provided by `mobile-detect`. The vulnerability is in the application's code, not the library itself.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **[B1] Spoof Specific OS:**
            *   *Likelihood:* High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to High
            *   *Description:* The attacker spoofs a specific operating system (often via the User-Agent) to trigger OS-specific behavior within the application. This could be used to access features or content intended only for that OS.
        *   **[B2] Bypass OS-Specific Security:**
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* High
            *   *Description:* If the application has weaker security measures for certain operating systems, the attacker can spoof that OS to bypass those security controls.

*   **Tactic:** Exploit Browser Detection Logic Flaws (HIGH-RISK)
    *   **Description:** Similar to OS detection flaws, this involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application uses the browser information from `mobile-detect`.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **[B4] Spoof Specific Browser:**
            *   *Likelihood:* High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to High
            *   *Description:* The attacker spoofs a specific browser (usually via the User-Agent) to trigger browser-specific behavior in the application.
        *   **[B5] Bypass Browser-Specific Security:**
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* High
            *   *Description:* If the application has different security measures for different browsers, the attacker can spoof a browser with weaker security to bypass controls.

* **Tactic:** Exploit Version Detection Logic Flaws (HIGH-RISK)
    * **Description:** This involves exploiting how application uses version of the browser.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **[A8] Spoof Older Version:**
            *   *Likelihood:* High
            *   *Impact:* Medium to High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to High
            *   *Description:* The attacker spoofs an older version to trigger fallback behavior or exploit known vulnerabilities in that older version's handling.
        *   **[A9] Bypass Security Checks:**
            *   *Likelihood:* High
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to High
            *   *Description:* The older version logic might have weaker security.

* **Tactic:** Exploit Browser Detection Logic Flaws (HIGH-RISK) - Continued
    * **Description:** Further attacks exploiting browser detection.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[B7] Spoof bot to bypass bot protection:**
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
            *   *Skill Level:* Low
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* High
            *   *Description:* If the application uses mobile-detect to identify bots, the attacker could spoof a legitimate user-agent.
        * **[B8] Spoof less common browser:**
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* High
            *   *Effort:* Low
