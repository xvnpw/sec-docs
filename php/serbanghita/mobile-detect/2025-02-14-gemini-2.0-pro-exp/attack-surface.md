# Attack Surface Analysis for serbanghita/mobile-detect

## Attack Surface: [User-Agent Spoofing for Restriction Bypass](./attack_surfaces/user-agent_spoofing_for_restriction_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate the `User-Agent` header to impersonate a different device or browser type to bypass restrictions enforced based on device detection.
    *   **`mobile-detect` Contribution:** The library's core function is to interpret the `User-Agent`, making it the direct enabler of this attack surface if the application relies solely on its output for security decisions.
    *   **Example:** An application offers a premium feature only to mobile users. An attacker on a desktop spoofs a mobile `User-Agent` to gain unauthorized access to the feature.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to features, data, or functionality; potential violation of licensing or terms of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if used for access control).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never solely rely on `User-Agent` for security:** Implement server-side authorization and validation that *does not* depend on the `User-Agent`.  Use `mobile-detect` for UX enhancements, not security enforcement.
        *   **Combine with other factors:** If device-specific behavior is needed, combine `User-Agent` detection with other client-side checks (e.g., screen size, touch capabilities) *but still validate on the server*.
        *   **Session Management:** Ensure proper session management and authentication are in place, regardless of the detected device.

## Attack Surface: [User-Agent Manipulation for Unexpected Code Paths](./attack_surfaces/user-agent_manipulation_for_unexpected_code_paths.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft malicious `User-Agent` strings to force the application into untested or less secure code paths.
    *   **`mobile-detect` Contribution:** The library's parsing of the `User-Agent` determines which code path is executed based on the detected device.  A manipulated `User-Agent` can trigger unintended paths.
    *   **Example:** An application has a special code path for a legacy mobile browser with known vulnerabilities. An attacker spoofs the `User-Agent` of that browser to trigger the vulnerable code.
    *   **Impact:** Potential exposure of vulnerabilities in less-tested code; unexpected application behavior; possible security bypass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if untested paths contain vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Testing:**  Test all code paths, including those for less common or legacy devices.  Use fuzzing techniques with various `User-Agent` strings.
        *   **Input Validation (of Results):** Validate the *output* of `mobile-detect` (e.g., check if the detected device is within an expected range) before using it to make decisions.
        *   **Default to Secure Path:** If the `User-Agent` is unrecognized or invalid, default to the most secure code path.
        * **Least Privilege:** Ensure that different code paths operate with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in libraries that `mobile-detect` depends on could be exploited.
    * **`mobile-detect` Contribution:** Indirectly contributes by relying on external dependencies.
    * **Example:** A dependency of `mobile-detect` has a known remote code execution vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially Critical or High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep `mobile-detect` and all its dependencies updated.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        * **Dependency Pinning:** Consider pinning dependency versions to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce new vulnerabilities (but balance this with the need to apply security updates).
