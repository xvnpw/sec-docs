# Threat Model Analysis for serbanghita/mobile-detect

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

* **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    * **Description:** A malicious attacker crafts a specific User-Agent string that exploits the regular expressions used internally by `mobile-detect` for pattern matching. This can cause the regular expression engine to enter a catastrophic backtracking scenario, consuming excessive CPU resources and potentially leading to a denial of service. This directly involves the internal workings of the `mobile-detect` library's pattern matching logic.
    * **Impact:** Application slowdown, increased server load, and potential unavailability of the application for legitimate users.
    * **Affected Component:** Regular Expression Engine (internal to the library).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the `mobile-detect` library updated as maintainers might address vulnerable regular expressions.
        * Implement rate limiting on requests to mitigate the impact of a large number of malicious User-Agent strings.
        * Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) with rules to detect and block potentially malicious User-Agent strings.
        * If possible, contribute to the `mobile-detect` project by reporting potentially vulnerable regular expressions.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack - Compromised `mobile-detect` Library](./threats/supply_chain_attack_-_compromised__mobile-detect__library.md)

* **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack - Compromised `mobile-detect` Library
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the `mobile-detect` library's repository or distribution channels and injects malicious code into the library. If the application uses this compromised version, the malicious code can be executed within the application's context. This directly involves the integrity of the `mobile-detect` library's code.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, data theft, remote code execution, and potential distribution of malware to users.
    * **Affected Component:** Entire `mobile-detect` library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify the integrity of the `mobile-detect` library by checking its checksum or using package management tools with integrity checks.
        * Use a dependency management tool that scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        * Monitor the `mobile-detect` repository for suspicious activity.
        * Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to track dependencies and identify potential risks.

## Threat: [Outdated Library with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/outdated_library_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Outdated Library with Known Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of `mobile-detect` that contains known security vulnerabilities within its code. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are aware of them. This directly involves flaws within the `mobile-detect` library's implementation.
    * **Impact:** Potential for various attacks depending on the specific vulnerability, including information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS) if the library's output is not properly sanitized, or other forms of compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** Entire `mobile-detect` library.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the `mobile-detect` library updated to the latest stable version.
        * Regularly review security advisories related to the `mobile-detect` library.
        * Use automated dependency scanning tools to identify outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities.
