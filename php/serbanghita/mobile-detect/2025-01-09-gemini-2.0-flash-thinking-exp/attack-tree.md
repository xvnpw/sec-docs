## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) by overloading regex engine](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__by_overloading_regex_engine.md)

A specifically crafted User-Agent string containing complex or nested regex patterns can force the regex engine into excessive backtracking. This consumes significant CPU resources, potentially leading to application slowdown or complete unavailability for legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause application slowdown or unavailability](./attack_tree_paths/cause_application_slowdown_or_unavailability.md)

An attacker sends requests with User-Agent strings designed to trigger ReDoS vulnerabilities within the `mobile-detect` library's regex patterns. This can overload the server, making the application slow or completely unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass mobile-specific security checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_mobile-specific_security_checks.md)

By manipulating the User-Agent, an attacker can evade security measures that are intended to be applied based on the detected device type. This could allow access to restricted resources or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable security features intended for specific devices](./attack_tree_paths/disable_security_features_intended_for_specific_devices.md)

An attacker could craft a User-Agent to make their device appear as a different type, potentially disabling security features that would normally be active for their actual device, making them more vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [If logged or used in further processing, can lead to secondary vulnerabilities (e.g., Log Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/if_logged_or_used_in_further_processing__can_lead_to_secondary_vulnerabilities__e_g___log_injection_.md)

If the application logs the detected device information without proper escaping, a malicious User-Agent string could inject code into the logs. If these logs are displayed on a web interface without sanitization, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against administrators viewing the logs. Similar injection vulnerabilities could occur if the output is used in other processing steps without proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit User-Agent Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_user-agent_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents the fundamental weakness of relying on potentially malicious input (the User-Agent string) for device detection without proper sanitization and secure processing. Attackers target the parsing logic itself to cause harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Regex Injection](./attack_tree_paths/regex_injection.md)

Attackers craft malicious User-Agent strings containing special regex characters or patterns. When processed by the `mobile-detect` library's regex engine, these injected patterns can alter the intended matching logic or cause resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)](./attack_tree_paths/redos__regular_expression_denial_of_service_.md)

This vulnerability arises from the inherent complexity of regular expressions. Certain patterns, when combined with specific input strings, can lead to exponential backtracking in the regex engine, causing it to consume excessive CPU time and resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Reliance on Mobile-Detect's Output](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_reliance_on_mobile-detect's_output.md)

This node highlights the danger of trusting the output of `mobile-detect` for critical security decisions or core application logic without server-side validation. Attackers can manipulate the detection process to influence the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application Logic via Incorrect Detection](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_logic_via_incorrect_detection.md)

Attackers craft User-Agent strings to be misclassified.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Feature Toggling Based on Mobile-Detect](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_feature_toggling_based_on_mobile-detect.md)

Attackers create User-Agent strings to influence which features are enabled or disabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Handling of Detection Results](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_handling_of_detection_results.md)

This critical node focuses on the risks associated with how the application processes and utilizes the output from `mobile-detect`. If this output is not handled securely, it can lead to secondary vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application blindly trusts Mobile-Detect's output](./attack_tree_paths/application_blindly_trusts_mobile-detect's_output.md)

The application uses the output without proper sanitization or validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious data disguised as device information](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_disguised_as_device_information.md)

Attackers craft User-Agent strings containing malicious payloads.
