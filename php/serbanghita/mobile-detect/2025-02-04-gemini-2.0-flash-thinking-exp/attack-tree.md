## Attack Tree Path: [Root Node: [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Mobile-Detect Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/root_node__critical_node__compromise_application_via_mobile-detect_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal. The attacker aims to negatively impact the application by exploiting weaknesses related to `mobile-detect`.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Success can lead to various negative outcomes, from minor UX issues to unauthorized access and application malfunction.
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust security measures throughout the application, especially those independent of client-side device detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Mobile Detection Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_mobile_detection_logic__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The attacker must first circumvent the device detection logic of `mobile-detect` to proceed with further attacks.
* **Techniques:** Primarily through crafting User-Agent strings or potentially exploiting ReDoS vulnerabilities.
* **Why High-Risk:** Bypassing detection is a prerequisite for many other attacks in this model.
* **Mitigation:**  Recognize that client-side detection is easily bypassed and avoid relying on it for security.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Crafted User-Agent String [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__crafted_user-agent_string__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the User-Agent string sent by the client's browser to influence `mobile-detect`'s output.
* **Techniques:**
    * **1.1. Spoofing Device Type [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Changing the User-Agent to mimic a different device.
        * **1.1.1. Emulate Desktop User-Agent on Mobile [CRITICAL NODE]:** Make a mobile device appear as a desktop.
        * **1.1.2. Emulate Mobile User-Agent on Desktop [CRITICAL NODE]:** Make a desktop device appear as a mobile.
        * **1.1.3. Emulate Specific Device/OS for Targeted Behavior [CRITICAL NODE]:** Craft a User-Agent for a specific device/OS.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Extremely easy to execute, requires minimal skill, and is often undetectable client-side.
* **Mitigation:** Never trust User-Agent for security. Use device detection only for UX enhancements.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Cause Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__cause_regex_denial_of_service__redos___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Crafting User-Agent strings that exploit vulnerable regular expressions in `mobile-detect` to cause a Denial of Service.
* **Techniques:**  Analyzing regex patterns and creating User-Agent strings that lead to catastrophic backtracking or excessive CPU consumption.
* **Why High-Risk:**  While less likely, successful ReDoS can lead to significant application downtime and impact availability.
* **Mitigation:** Regularly review and test regex patterns (in `mobile-detect` updates or custom regex if used). Implement rate limiting and monitoring for DoS symptoms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Application Malfunction or Incorrect Behavior [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_application_malfunction_or_incorrect_behavior__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misdetection to cause the application to behave incorrectly or malfunction.
* **Techniques:**
    * **4.1. Incorrect Content Rendering/Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Application serves wrong content or has broken UI due to misdetection.
        * **4.1.1. Application Serves Wrong Version of Website/App [CRITICAL NODE]:** Mobile version on desktop or vice versa.
        * **4.1.2. Broken Layout or UI due to Incorrect Device Detection [CRITICAL NODE]:** Layout breaks due to incorrect device assumption.
    * **4.2. Logic Errors due to Misdetection [CRITICAL NODE]:** Application logic branches incorrectly based on misdetection.
        * **4.2.1. Application Logic Branches Incorrectly based on `mobile-detect` output [CRITICAL NODE]:** Conditional logic executes wrong code path.
    * **4.3. Denial of Service (Indirect) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Triggering ReDoS via crafted User-Agent strings.
        * **4.3.1. Trigger Regex Denial of Service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** As described in 1.2.2.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Malfunction can degrade user experience, lead to data processing errors, and in the case of DoS, disrupt application availability.
* **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test application behavior with various User-Agent strings. Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. For ReDoS, monitor for DoS symptoms and consider regex optimization if feasible (though less control over `mobile-detect` regex).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misdetection for Malicious Purposes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misdetection_for_malicious_purposes__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Leveraging misdetection to gain unauthorized access or manipulate application behavior for malicious gain.
* **Why High-Risk:** Can lead to security breaches and unauthorized access to features or data.
* **Mitigation:**  Never rely on `mobile-detect` for access control. Implement strong server-side authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Features/Content [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_featurescontent__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Using misdetection to access features or content intended for different device types.
* **Techniques:**
    * **3.1. Access Mobile-Only Features on Desktop [CRITICAL NODE]:** Spoofing mobile User-Agent on desktop.
        * **3.1.1. Bypass Mobile-Specific Security Checks [CRITICAL NODE]:** Circumventing weak security checks based solely on `mobile-detect`.
    * **3.2. Access Desktop-Only Features on Mobile [CRITICAL NODE]:** Spoofing desktop User-Agent on mobile.
        * **3.2.1. Bypass Desktop-Specific Security Checks [CRITICAL NODE]:** Circumventing weak security checks based solely on `mobile-detect`.
    * **3.3. Bypass Device-Specific Feature Gating [CRITICAL NODE]:** General bypass of feature gating based on device type.
        * **3.3.1. Access Features Intended for Different Device Types [CRITICAL NODE]:** Accessing features not meant for the user's actual device.
* **Why High-Risk:** Direct security impact, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
* **Mitigation:**  Implement server-side security checks and authorization that are independent of device detection. Use role-based access control and other robust security mechanisms.
