Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path: Exploit Known Joomla Core Vulnerabilities
- Attack Vector: Identify a publicly known vulnerability in the specific version of Joomla being used.
- Attack Vector: Exploit this vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- Attack Vector: Exploit this vulnerability to perform SQL Injection, enabling the attacker to manipulate or extract data from the database.

High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Joomla Extensions
- Attack Vector: Identify installed Joomla extensions and their versions.
- Attack Vector: Discover a known vulnerability in one of the installed extensions.
- Attack Vector: Exploit the extension vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the context of the extension.
- Attack Vector: Exploit the extension vulnerability to perform SQL Injection against the extension's database queries.

High-Risk Path: Abuse Joomla's Administrative Features
- Attack Vector: Gain unauthorized access to the Joomla administrator panel through methods like:
    - Brute-forcing administrator credentials.
    - Exploiting weak default credentials.
    - Phishing attacks targeting administrators.
    - Compromising an administrator's device.
    - Exploiting authentication vulnerabilities in the admin panel.
- Attack Vector: Once inside the admin panel, leverage administrative privileges to:
    - Install malicious extensions containing backdoors or malware.
    - Directly modify Joomla core files to inject malicious code.
    - Modify template files to inject malicious scripts that execute on every page load.
    - Modify database records to inject malicious content or create rogue administrator accounts.
    - Create new administrator accounts for persistent access.
    - Modify global configuration settings to weaken security or enable malicious functionalities.

High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure File Upload Settings
- Attack Vector: Identify misconfigured file upload settings that do not properly restrict file types or locations.
- Attack Vector: Upload a malicious file, such as a PHP shell, which can then be accessed to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

Critical Node: Exploit Weak Database Credentials in `configuration.php`
- Attack Vector: Gain access to the `configuration.php` file (through methods like information disclosure vulnerabilities or local file inclusion).
- Attack Vector: Extract the database credentials stored in the file.
- Attack Vector: Use these credentials to directly access the database, allowing for complete control over the application's data.

Critical Node: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Attack Vector: Leverage vulnerabilities in the Joomla core, extensions, or even through insecure configurations to execute arbitrary code on the server. This grants the attacker complete control over the system.

Critical Node: SQL Injection
- Attack Vector: Inject malicious SQL queries into input fields or URLs to bypass security checks and interact directly with the database. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or even privilege escalation.

Critical Node: Gain Access to Joomla Administrator Panel
- Attack Vector: Successfully bypass authentication mechanisms to access the administrative backend of Joomla. This is a gateway to numerous other high-impact attacks.

Critical Node: Leverage Administrator Access for Compromise
- Attack Vector: Utilize the privileges granted by administrator access to perform malicious actions, as detailed in the "Abuse Joomla's Administrative Features" path.
