*   **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries to manipulate or extract data.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Joomla's reliance on a database and the potential for developers to write vulnerable SQL queries, especially within custom extensions or when not using Joomla's built-in query builders securely.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable extension might directly concatenate user input into a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject `'; DROP TABLE users; --`.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential for complete compromise of the application and underlying database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Joomla's built-in database query methods (e.g., `JDatabaseDriver::quote()`, prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Regularly review and audit custom extensions for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep Joomla core and extensions updated to patch known SQL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Joomla's dynamic content generation and the potential for developers to not properly sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it, especially within extensions, modules, or custom templates.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable comment section in an extension might allow an attacker to inject `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which will execute in the browsers of other users viewing the comment.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for all user-supplied data displayed on the website.
        *   Utilize Joomla's built-in functions for output encoding.
        *   Regularly update Joomla core and extensions to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   **Description:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Joomla application.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in Joomla core or extensions, such as insecure file upload handling, deserialization flaws, or template injection vulnerabilities, can allow attackers to upload or execute malicious code.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable file upload component in an extension might allow an attacker to upload a PHP shell script, which they can then access to execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breach, malware installation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Joomla core and all extensions updated to patch known RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strict file upload restrictions and validation.
        *   Disable or remove any unused or vulnerable extensions.

*   **Attack Surface:** File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (LFI/RFI)
    *   **Description:** Attackers can include arbitrary files on the server (LFI) or from remote servers (RFI), potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in Joomla core or extensions where user input is used to specify file paths without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to include malicious files.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable extension might use a GET parameter to include a template file, allowing an attacker to change the parameter to include a local configuration file or a remote malicious script.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (e.g., accessing configuration files), remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user input to directly specify file paths.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any file path parameters.
        *   Keep Joomla core and extensions updated to patch known file inclusion vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Extension Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Security flaws within third-party Joomla extensions.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Joomla's extensive extension ecosystem means that the security of the application heavily relies on the security of third-party extensions. Developers may have varying levels of security expertise, leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A popular gallery extension might have an unpatched SQL injection vulnerability, allowing attackers to compromise websites using that extension.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can include SQL injection, XSS, RCE, and data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install extensions from trusted sources (Joomla Extensions Directory is a good starting point).
        *   Regularly update all installed extensions.
        *   Remove unused extensions.
        *   Consider security audits for critical extensions.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in installed extensions.
