## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Core Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **RCE (Remote Code Execution) (CVE-XXX) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the WordPress core code that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could involve exploiting flaws in how WordPress handles file uploads, processes data, or interacts with the underlying operating system.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated), Medium to High (if outdated)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete server compromise, data theft, website defacement)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (depends on the specific vulnerability's complexity)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert (requires understanding of code vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (sophisticated RCEs can be stealthy, hiding within normal server processes)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Keep WordPress core updated to the latest version.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules to detect and block RCE attempts.
        *   Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using security scanners.
        *   Minimize the use of unnecessary features and plugins.
        *   Implement strong file permissions and server hardening.

*   **Authentication Bypass (CVE-YYY) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** A flaw in WordPress's authentication logic that allows an attacker to bypass the normal login process and gain administrative access without valid credentials. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in session management, cookie handling, or password reset mechanisms.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated), Medium (if outdated)
    *   **Impact:** High (direct administrative access, full control over the website)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (depends on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (requires understanding of authentication mechanisms and web application security)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (unusual login patterns or access from unexpected locations might be detected)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Keep WordPress core updated.
        *   Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).
        *   Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Use strong password policies.
        *   Regularly review and test the authentication process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Brute Force (Weak Password) [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Repeatedly guessing the administrator's password by trying many different combinations.  Automated tools can try thousands of passwords per second.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if weak passwords are used and no rate limiting is in place)
    *   **Impact:** High (direct administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Low (automated tools are readily available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (large number of failed login attempts are easily detectable) - *unless* rate limiting is bypassed or the attack is distributed.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements).
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts (limit the number of attempts from a single IP address within a given time period).
        *   Use a WAF to block brute-force attacks.
        *   Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).
        *   Monitor login logs for failed attempts.

*   **Phishing (Fake Login) [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Tricking the administrator into entering their credentials on a fake WordPress login page that mimics the real one.  This is often done through deceptive emails or links.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends on the sophistication of the phishing attack and the user's awareness)
    *   **Impact:** High (direct administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (creating a convincing fake login page and sending phishing emails)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires user reporting, email filtering, or web content analysis)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Educate administrators about phishing attacks and how to identify them.
        *   Implement email security measures (spam filters, anti-phishing tools).
        *   Encourage administrators to verify the URL of the login page before entering credentials.
        *   Use a WAF to block access to known phishing sites.
        *   Implement security awareness training programs.

*   **Stolen Credentials [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Obtaining the administrator's credentials from other sources, such as data breaches on other websites where the administrator reused the same password, or through malware on the administrator's computer.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on the administrator's password habits and the security of other services they use)
    *   **Impact:** High (direct administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Varies greatly (from very low if credentials are found in a public data dump, to very high if it requires a targeted attack)
    *   **Skill Level:** Varies greatly (from Script Kiddie to Expert)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (unless the attacker's activity after login is suspicious or unusual)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Encourage administrators to use unique, strong passwords for every website.
        *   Promote the use of password managers.
        *   Monitor for data breaches and notify administrators if their credentials may have been compromised.
        *   Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).
        *   Use security software on administrator computers to prevent malware infections.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Core Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_core_functionality.md)

* **Exploit Update Mechanism [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Description:** A vulnerability within the WordPress update process itself that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code during a seemingly legitimate update.
    * **Likelihood:** Very Low (this would be a highly critical and widely publicized vulnerability)
    * **Impact:** Very High (complete server compromise, potential for widespread infection)
    * **Effort:** Very High (requires deep understanding of WordPress's update mechanism and code signing processes)
    * **Skill Level:** Expert (requires advanced knowledge of software security and exploitation)
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (would likely be disguised as a legitimate update)
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Ensure that updates are downloaded only from the official WordPress.org repository.
        *   Verify the digital signatures of downloaded update files (WordPress does this automatically, but manual verification can be an added precaution).
        *   Monitor the update process for any anomalies or unexpected behavior.
        *   Implement a robust intrusion detection system (IDS).

* **Improper Sanitization/Validation in REST API Endpoints (CVE-ZZZ) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in a specific WordPress REST API endpoint that fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code, access unauthorized data, or perform other unintended actions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the specific endpoint and whether it has been patched)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the nature of the vulnerability and the data exposed)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires understanding of REST API vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (requires analyzing API traffic and logs for suspicious patterns)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Keep WordPress core and any plugins that use the REST API updated.
        *   If developing custom REST API endpoints, follow secure coding practices, including input validation and output encoding.
        *   Use authentication and authorization to restrict access to sensitive API endpoints.
        *   Implement a WAF with rules to detect and block malicious requests to the REST API.
        *   Regularly audit the REST API for vulnerabilities.
