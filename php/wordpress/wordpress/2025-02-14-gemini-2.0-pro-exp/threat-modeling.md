# Threat Model Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Threat: [Plugin Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/plugin_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a poorly coded or outdated plugin to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. They might use a known exploit or find a zero-day. This allows them to control the server, modify files, and access the database.
    *   **Impact:** Complete site compromise, data theft, defacement, malware distribution, use of the server for malicious purposes.
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** The vulnerable plugin (any PHP file within the plugin's directory). Potentially affects the entire WordPress installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use only reputable plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all plugins updated.
        *   Audit and remove unused plugins.
        *   Implement a WAF with rules for common plugin exploits.
        *   Use a security plugin to scan for vulnerable plugins.
        *   File integrity monitoring.
        *   Restrict file upload capabilities within plugins.

## Threat: [Theme Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - *If Theme is Custom or From Untrusted Source*](./threats/theme_cross-site_scripting__xss__-_if_theme_is_custom_or_from_untrusted_source.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a theme's template files to inject malicious JavaScript. This often happens when user input isn't sanitized before display. The attacker might target theme functions handling comments, search, or custom fields. *Note: This is only HIGH if the theme is custom-developed or from an untrusted source. Well-maintained themes from reputable sources significantly reduce this risk.*
    *   **Impact:** Theft of user cookies, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, phishing.
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** Vulnerable theme's template files (e.g., `header.php`, `footer.php`, `single.php`, `comments.php`). Functions like `the_title()`, `the_content()`, `comment_text()`, and custom functions outputting user data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use reputable themes from trusted sources.
        *   Keep themes updated.
        *   Ensure proper escaping using WordPress's escaping functions (e.g., `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`).
        *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP).
        *   Audit theme code for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Login Attack via `wp-login.php`](./threats/brute-force_login_attack_via__wp-login_php_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses automated tools to try many username/password combinations against `wp-login.php`. They might use common usernames (like "admin") and password lists.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the WordPress dashboard, potentially leading to complete site compromise.
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** `wp-login.php` (the WordPress login page).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit login attempts (using a plugin).
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Rename the default "admin" user account.
        *   Use strong, unique passwords.
        *   Consider a WAF to block brute-force attempts.
        *   Change the login URL (using a plugin).

## Threat: [XML-RPC Brute-Force and DDoS Attack](./threats/xml-rpc_brute-force_and_ddos_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets `xmlrpc.php` with numerous requests for brute-force logins (bypassing some login limits) or to launch a DDoS attack.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts (brute-force), denial of service (site unavailable).
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** `xmlrpc.php` (the XML-RPC endpoint).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable `xmlrpc.php` if not needed (via `.htaccess` or a plugin).
        *   If needed, restrict access to specific IP addresses.
        *   Use a WAF to block malicious XML-RPC requests and rate-limit.
        *   Monitor `xmlrpc.php` access logs.

## Threat: [WordPress Core Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/wordpress_core_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the WordPress core software. These are publicly disclosed, and attackers scan for outdated versions.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but can range from information disclosure to complete site compromise (RCE).
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** Various core files and functions, depending on the vulnerability. Could be in authentication, media handling, comments, or the REST API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for unpatched vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable automatic updates for minor and security releases.
        *   Monitor for major releases and plan updates promptly.
        *   Use a staging environment to test updates.

## Threat: [`wp-config.php` Exposure](./threats/_wp-config_php__exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to `wp-config.php` through server misconfiguration, a plugin/theme vulnerability, or a compromised server. This file contains database credentials and sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, complete site compromise, data theft.
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** `wp-config.php` (the WordPress configuration file).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrictive file permissions (e.g., 600 or 640).
        *   Move `wp-config.php` outside the web root, if possible.
        *   Regularly review the file for accidental exposure.
        *   Strong, unique database credentials.
        *   Disable directory listing in the web server configuration.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Database Access via Exposed Credentials](./threats/unauthorized_database_access_via_exposed_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains access to database credentials in `wp-config.php` and directly connects to the database, bypassing WordPress.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data theft, modification, deletion, potential for further server compromise.
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** The database (MySQL/MariaDB), accessed using credentials from `wp-config.php`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strong, unique database password.
        * Restrict database access to specific IP addresses.
        * Regularly audit database user permissions.
        * Database activity monitoring.
        * Secure `wp-config.php` as described above.

## Threat: [REST API Unauthorized Data Access - *If Not Properly Secured*](./threats/rest_api_unauthorized_data_access_-_if_not_properly_secured.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfigured or vulnerable REST API endpoint to access or modify data without authentication. WordPress's REST API exposes data, and if not secured, it's a target. *Note: This is only HIGH if the API is not properly secured with authentication and authorization.*
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized data modification, potential for further attacks.
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** The WordPress REST API (various endpoints). Involves functions/classes related to `WP_REST_Server`, `WP_REST_Request`, and endpoint controllers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Require authentication for all sensitive REST API endpoints.
        * Use the `permission_callback` in `register_rest_route()` to restrict access.
        * Limit the data exposed by the REST API.
        * Regularly review and audit REST API configurations.
        * Use a plugin to manage and secure the REST API.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Plugin Update](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_plugin_update.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the update server or developer account of a legitimate plugin and distributes a malicious update.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of sites using the affected plugin, leading to data breaches, malware, and complete site control.
    *   **WordPress Component Affected:** The compromised plugin (any files), and potentially the entire WordPress installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use plugins from reputable developers with a strong security track record.
        * Monitor security news for compromised plugins.
        * Consider delaying updates briefly (trade-off).
        * Use a staging environment to test updates.
        * Implement file integrity monitoring.
