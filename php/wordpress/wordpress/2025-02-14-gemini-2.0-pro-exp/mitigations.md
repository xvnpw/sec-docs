# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Management (WordPress-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_management__wordpress-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **WordPress.org Repository:** Prioritize plugins from the official WordPress.org repository. Thoroughly examine the plugin's page: ratings, reviews, active installations, "last updated" date, and support forum activity.  Low ratings, few installations, outdated plugins, or unresolved support issues are red flags.
    2.  **Developer Reputation (Within WordPress Ecosystem):** Research the plugin developer. Are they known and respected *within the WordPress community*?  Do they contribute to WordPress core, have other well-regarded plugins, or are they active in the community?
    3.  **Premium Plugins (Official Sources):** If using premium plugins, purchase *only* from the official developer's website or a reputable WordPress-focused marketplace (e.g., a marketplace run by a known theme/plugin company).  Avoid "nulled" or cracked versions.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Plugins):** Install *only* essential plugins. Deactivate and delete any plugins that are not actively in use.  Each plugin adds to the attack surface.
    5.  **Updates (WordPress Update Mechanism):** Utilize the built-in WordPress update mechanism. Enable automatic updates for plugins from *highly trusted* sources (well-known developers with a strong track record). For less-trusted or mission-critical plugins, use a staging environment (also managed through WordPress or a hosting provider's WordPress tools) to test updates before deploying to production. *Never* ignore updates.
    6.  **WordPress-Specific Security Plugins:** Install a security plugin that is *specifically designed for WordPress* and offers features like:
        *   **Plugin Vulnerability Scanning:** Scans installed plugins for known vulnerabilities against a WordPress-specific vulnerability database.
        *   **WordPress File Integrity Monitoring:** Detects unauthorized changes to plugin files within the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
    7. **Vulnerability Disclosure Programs:** If you develop custom plugins, implement a responsible disclosure program.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (via Plugins) (Severity: Critical):** Prevents installation of plugins containing backdoors, malware, or other malicious code specifically targeting WordPress.
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities) (Severity: High to Critical):** Reduces the risk of known and zero-day vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins being exploited.
    *   **Data Breaches (via Plugin Vulnerabilities) (Severity: High to Critical):** Protects against plugins that might leak or steal sensitive data stored within WordPress or accessed through WordPress APIs.
    *   **Website Defacement (via Plugin Vulnerabilities) (Severity: Medium to High):** Reduces the chance of attackers using plugin vulnerabilities to alter the WordPress website's appearance.
    *   **SEO Spam (via Plugin Vulnerabilities) (Severity: Medium):** Helps prevent plugins from injecting spam links or content into the WordPress website.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Risk reduction: High (80-90% if followed diligently).
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Risk reduction: High (70-80%, depends on update frequency).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Risk reduction: Medium to High (60-80%, depending on the type of data handled).
    *   **Website Defacement:** Risk reduction: High (75-85%).
    *   **SEO Spam:** Risk reduction: High (80-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic plugin vetting (checking WordPress.org reviews).
    *   Automatic updates enabled for a few trusted plugins via the WordPress dashboard.
    *   Wordfence Security (a WordPress-specific plugin) installed and configured for basic scans.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized vetting checklist for *all* new plugins, including developer reputation checks.
    *   Staging environment for testing plugin updates before production deployment (using WordPress-specific staging tools).
    *   Regular review of installed plugins to identify and remove unnecessary ones.
    *   Configuration of Wordfence for more advanced WordPress-specific features (file integrity monitoring, specific vulnerability scanning against WordPress databases).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Theme Security and Child Theme Usage (WordPress-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/theme_security_and_child_theme_usage__wordpress-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **WordPress.org Theme Directory:** Prioritize themes from the official WordPress.org theme directory. This ensures a baseline level of code review and security checks.
    2.  **Reputable WordPress Theme Developers:** If using a theme from outside the official directory, choose well-known, trusted WordPress theme developers with a strong reputation within the community.
    3.  **Updates (WordPress Update Mechanism):** Use the built-in WordPress update mechanism for themes. Enable automatic updates for themes from trusted sources. For less-trusted themes or major updates, test in a WordPress staging environment first.
    4.  **WordPress Child Themes:** *Always* create and use a WordPress child theme for *any* customizations to the theme's code or styling. This is a core WordPress feature that isolates your changes and prevents them from being overwritten during theme updates. *Never* modify the parent theme directly.
    5.  **Unused Themes (WordPress Dashboard):** Delete any unused themes from the WordPress installation via the WordPress dashboard (Appearance > Themes).
    6. **Security Plugin:** Use security plugin to scan theme files.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection (via Themes) (Severity: Critical):** Prevents the use of themes containing backdoors or malware specifically designed to target WordPress.
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (WordPress Theme Vulnerabilities) (Severity: High to Critical):** Reduces the risk of known and zero-day vulnerabilities in WordPress themes being exploited.
    *   **Website Defacement (via Theme Vulnerabilities) (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents attackers from using theme vulnerabilities to modify the WordPress website's appearance.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (in Theme Customizations) (Severity: High):** Child themes help prevent accidental introduction of XSS vulnerabilities during theme customization, a common issue in WordPress.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Code Injection:** Risk reduction: High (85-95% if using reputable sources).
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Risk reduction: High (70-80%, depends on update frequency).
    *   **Website Defacement:** Risk reduction: High (80-90%).
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Risk reduction: Medium (50-60%, child themes are crucial, but secure coding practices are also essential).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Theme sourced from a reputable WordPress developer.
    *   WordPress child theme in use for customizations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automatic updates for the theme are *not* enabled (due to concerns about potential compatibility issues). Manual updates are performed via the WordPress dashboard, but not always immediately.
    *   No WordPress-specific staging environment for testing theme updates.
    *   Several unused themes are still present in the WordPress installation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [WordPress Core Hardening and Updates (WordPress-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/wordpress_core_hardening_and_updates__wordpress-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Automatic Updates (Minor - WordPress Core):** Enable automatic updates for minor WordPress core releases *through the WordPress dashboard or wp-config.php*. These primarily contain security patches and bug fixes.
    2.  **Staging Environment (Major - WordPress-Specific Tools):** For *major* WordPress core updates, *always* test in a staging environment *before* deploying to production. Use WordPress-specific staging tools provided by your hosting provider or plugins designed for this purpose. Major updates can introduce compatibility issues with plugins and themes.
    3.  **wp-config.php Hardening (WordPress-Specific Settings):**
        *   **Disable File Editing (WordPress Setting):** Add `define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true );` to `wp-config.php`. This disables the built-in theme and plugin editor within the WordPress admin dashboard, preventing attackers from modifying files through this interface.
        *   **Security Keys (WordPress-Generated):** Generate unique authentication keys and salts using the official WordPress secret-key generator (https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/) and add them to `wp-config.php`. Change these keys periodically, ideally using a WordPress plugin or script that automates this process.
        *   **Database Prefix (WordPress Installation Setting):** During WordPress installation, use a non-standard database table prefix (e.g., `wp_abc123_` instead of the default `wp_`). This is a WordPress-specific setting that makes SQL injection attacks slightly more difficult.
        * **Disable XML-RPC (if not needed):** If you don't use features that rely on XML-RPC (like the WordPress mobile app or some third-party services), disable it to reduce the attack surface. This can be done via a WordPress plugin.
        * **Limit Login Attempts:** Use a WordPress plugin to limit the number of failed login attempts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (WordPress Core Vulnerabilities) (Severity: Critical):** Keeps the WordPress core up-to-date with the latest security patches, mitigating known vulnerabilities specific to the WordPress core software.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (via Core Vulnerabilities) (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting core WordPress vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (within WordPress) (Severity: High to Critical):** Prevents attackers from gaining unauthorized administrative access to the WordPress dashboard.
    *   **SQL Injection (WordPress-Specific) (Severity: High to Critical):** A non-standard database prefix makes WordPress-specific SQL injection attacks slightly more difficult.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (WordPress Login) (Severity: Medium):** Limiting login attempts mitigates brute-force attacks against WordPress user accounts.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via XML-RPC (Severity: Medium):** Disabling XML-RPC prevents its abuse for DoS attacks targeting WordPress.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Risk reduction: Very High (90-95% with prompt updates).
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Risk reduction: High (80-90%, depends on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: High (75-85%).
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduction: Low (10-20%, this is a minor defense-in-depth measure).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduction: High (80-90%, with a properly configured WordPress login limiter plugin).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via XML-RPC:** Risk reduction: High (90-100%, if XML-RPC is completely disabled via a WordPress plugin or configuration).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Automatic updates for minor core releases are enabled through the WordPress dashboard.
    *   `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` is set to `true` in `wp-config.php`.
    *   Unique WordPress security keys are in use.
    *   A non-standard database prefix was used during WordPress installation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No WordPress-specific staging environment for testing major core updates.
    *   WordPress security keys have not been changed recently.
    *   XML-RPC is enabled (but not actively used). A WordPress plugin to disable it has not been installed.
    *   A WordPress plugin to limit login attempts is not installed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure User Roles and Permissions (WordPress-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_user_roles_and_permissions__wordpress-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege (WordPress Roles):** Assign users only the minimum necessary permissions using the *built-in WordPress roles* (Subscriber, Contributor, Author, Editor, Administrator). Avoid granting Administrator access unless absolutely required.
    2.  **Custom Roles (WordPress Plugins):** If the default WordPress roles don't fit your needs, create custom roles with specific capabilities using a WordPress plugin like "User Role Editor." This allows fine-grained control over permissions within WordPress.
    3.  **Regular Audits (WordPress User Management):** Periodically review all user accounts and their assigned roles *within the WordPress dashboard*. Remove or downgrade accounts that are no longer needed or have excessive permissions.
    4.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (WordPress Plugins):** Enforce 2FA for *all* WordPress user accounts, especially those with administrative or editing privileges. Use a WordPress plugin like "Wordfence Login Security" or "Two Factor Authentication."

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (within WordPress) (Severity: High):** Prevents users from gaining unauthorized access to higher-level WordPress functions.
    *   **Data Breaches (via Compromised WordPress Accounts) (Severity: High):** Limits the potential damage if a WordPress user account is compromised.
    *   **Website Defacement (via Unauthorized WordPress Access) (Severity: Medium to High):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized content changes within WordPress.
    *   **Malicious Actions by Insiders (within WordPress) (Severity: Medium to High):** Mitigates the risk of intentional or unintentional harm caused by authorized WordPress users.
    *   **Compromised Credentials (WordPress Login) (Severity: High):** 2FA significantly reduces the risk of attackers using stolen passwords to access WordPress.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: High (80-90%).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Risk reduction: Medium to High (60-80%, depending on the data and user roles).
    *   **Website Defacement:** Risk reduction: Medium to High (60-80%).
    *   **Malicious Actions by Insiders:** Risk reduction: Medium (40-60%, depends on the level of trust and monitoring).
    *   **Compromised Credentials:** Risk reduction: Very High (90-95% with 2FA).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic adherence to the principle of least privilege (most users are assigned Editor or Author roles within WordPress).
    *   2FA is enabled for Administrator accounts using a WordPress plugin.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No custom WordPress roles have been defined.
    *   2FA is *not* enforced for Editor or Author accounts.
    *   User account audits within the WordPress dashboard are not performed regularly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comment Spam and Trackback Abuse (WordPress-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/comment_spam_and_trackback_abuse__wordpress-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Akismet or Similar (WordPress Plugin):** Install and activate a robust anti-spam plugin like Akismet, which is specifically designed to filter spam comments and trackbacks in WordPress.
    2.  **Comment Moderation (WordPress Settings):** Enable comment moderation within the WordPress settings (Settings > Discussion).  Require manual approval for all comments, or at least for comments from new users or those containing links.
    3.  **Disable Trackbacks/Pingbacks (WordPress Settings - If Not Needed):** If you don't actively use trackbacks and pingbacks, disable them entirely within the WordPress settings (Settings > Discussion) to reduce spam and potential DDoS attacks targeting these WordPress features.
    4.  **CAPTCHA (WordPress Plugin):** Implement a CAPTCHA system using a WordPress plugin to prevent automated bots from submitting comments.
    5.  **NoFollow Links (WordPress Setting/Plugin):** Ensure that links in comments are automatically set to "nofollow" to discourage spammers seeking SEO benefits. This can often be configured within WordPress settings or through an SEO plugin.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Comment Spam (Severity: Low to Medium):** Prevents the posting of unwanted or malicious comments on your WordPress site.
    *   **Trackback Spam (Severity: Low to Medium):** Prevents abuse of the WordPress trackback feature for spam.
    *   **SEO Spam (Severity: Medium):** Prevents spammers from using your site to improve their search engine rankings.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (via Trackback/Pingback Abuse) (Severity: Medium):** Disabling these features mitigates potential DDoS attacks.
    *   **Malicious Links (Severity: Medium):** Moderation and CAPTCHAs help prevent the posting of links to malicious websites.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Comment Spam:** Risk reduction: Very High (90-95% with Akismet and moderation).
    *   **Trackback Spam:** Risk reduction: Very High (95-100% if disabled).
    *   **SEO Spam:** Risk reduction: High (80-90%).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduction: High (90-100% if trackbacks/pingbacks are disabled).
    *   **Malicious Links:** Risk reduction: Medium to High (60-80%, depending on moderation settings).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Akismet plugin is installed and activated.
    *   Comment moderation is enabled for comments containing links.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Trackbacks and pingbacks are enabled (but not actively used).
    *   A CAPTCHA plugin is not installed.
    *   "Nofollow" setting for comment links is not explicitly configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Information Disclosure (WordPress-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/information_disclosure__wordpress-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hide WordPress Version:** Remove or obscure the WordPress version number from your site's source code and HTTP headers. This makes it harder for attackers to target known vulnerabilities specific to your version. Use a WordPress security plugin or code snippets to achieve this. The generator meta tag should be removed.
    2.  **Disable User Enumeration (WordPress Plugins/Configuration):** Prevent attackers from easily discovering WordPress usernames through techniques like author archives or REST API endpoints.  WordPress plugins can help restrict access to this information, or you can modify your theme's code to remove author archives.
    3. **Error Handling:** Configure your server and WordPress to display generic error messages.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Targeted Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Hiding the WordPress version makes it harder for attackers to identify and exploit version-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **User Enumeration (Severity: Low to Medium):** Prevents attackers from gathering a list of valid usernames, which can be used in brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.
    *   **Information Leakage (Severity: Low to Medium):** Reduces the amount of information about your WordPress installation that is publicly available.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Targeted Attacks:** Risk reduction: Medium (40-60%).
    *   **User Enumeration:** Risk reduction: Medium to High (60-80%, depending on the implemented measures).
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduction: Low to Medium (30-50%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The WordPress version is visible in the site's source code.
    *   User enumeration is possible through author archives.
    *   No specific measures have been taken to prevent information disclosure.
