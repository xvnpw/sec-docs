Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Secure User Roles and Permissions" mitigation strategy for WordPress.

## Deep Analysis: Secure User Roles and Permissions (WordPress)

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the "Secure User Roles and Permissions" mitigation strategy in the context of a WordPress-based application, identify gaps in implementation, and recommend improvements to enhance security posture against relevant threats.  This analysis aims to move beyond a superficial understanding and delve into the practical implications and limitations of the strategy.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Secure User Roles and Permissions" mitigation strategy as described, targeting the WordPress application itself.  It encompasses:

*   **WordPress Core Roles:**  Analysis of the built-in roles (Subscriber, Contributor, Author, Editor, Administrator) and their appropriate use.
*   **Custom Roles:**  Evaluation of the need for and potential benefits of custom roles.
*   **User Account Audits:**  Assessment of the frequency and thoroughness of user account reviews.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Analysis of the implementation and enforcement of 2FA for various user roles.
*   **WordPress Plugins:** Consideration of plugins used for role management and 2FA, but *not* a full security audit of those plugins themselves.  We assume the chosen plugins are reputable and regularly updated.
*   **Threats:**  The specific threats listed in the mitigation strategy document (Privilege Escalation, Data Breaches, Website Defacement, Malicious Actions by Insiders, Compromised Credentials).

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Security of the underlying server infrastructure.
*   Security of the WordPress theme or other plugins beyond those directly related to user roles and 2FA.
*   General web application security best practices outside the scope of user roles and permissions.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Review of Existing Documentation:**  Examine the provided mitigation strategy description and the "Currently Implemented" and "Missing Implementation" sections.
2.  **Capability Mapping:**  Map the capabilities of each built-in WordPress role to understand the potential impact of compromise.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Analyze how each threat could be realized given the current implementation and identify the gaps.
4.  **Risk Assessment:**  Re-evaluate the risk reduction percentages based on a deeper understanding of the capabilities and gaps.
5.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Develop specific, actionable recommendations to address the identified gaps and improve the overall security posture.
6.  **Plugin Research:** Briefly research common, reputable plugins for custom role management and 2FA to ensure the recommendations are practical.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1. Review of Existing State

The current implementation acknowledges the principle of least privilege and uses it to some extent (most users are Editors or Authors).  2FA is implemented for Administrators, which is a crucial step.  However, significant gaps exist: the lack of custom roles, the absence of 2FA for Editors/Authors, and the lack of regular user audits.

#### 4.2. Capability Mapping (WordPress Core Roles)

| Role          | Key Capabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Potential Impact of Compromise
