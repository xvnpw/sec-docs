# Threat Model Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known WordPress Core Vulnerability](./threats/exploitation_of_known_wordpress_core_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker identifies a publicly known security vulnerability within the WordPress core codebase. They then craft an exploit to leverage this flaw, potentially sending malicious requests or manipulating data to trigger the vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the impact can be severe, including remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the website and potentially the underlying server. It can also lead to significant data breaches, where sensitive information is exposed or stolen.
    * **Affected Component:** WordPress Core Software (specific modules, functions, or files depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Immediately update WordPress core:** Regularly update to the latest stable version as soon as security updates are released. This is the most crucial step in mitigating known core vulnerabilities.
        * **Monitor official WordPress security channels:** Stay informed about security advisories released by the WordPress security team.
        * **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide a layer of protection by detecting and blocking attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities before they reach the WordPress application.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attack on Administrator Login](./threats/brute-force_attack_on_administrator_login.md)

* **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the WordPress administrative dashboard by repeatedly trying different username and password combinations on the `/wp-login.php` page. This exploits the core authentication mechanism.
    * **Impact:** Successful brute-force attacks grant attackers administrative privileges, allowing them to take complete control of the website. This can lead to website defacement, malware injection, data theft, and the creation of rogue administrator accounts.
    * **Affected Component:** WordPress Core Authentication System (`/wp-login.php`, user management functions).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce strong password policies:** Require users, especially administrators, to use strong, unique passwords.
        * **Implement login attempt limiting:** Use plugins or server-level configurations to limit the number of failed login attempts from a specific IP address.
        * **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):** Add an extra layer of security requiring a second verification method beyond just a password.
        * **Consider changing the default login URL:** While security through obscurity, it can deter basic automated attacks. Use plugins to change `/wp-admin` and `/wp-login.php` URLs.
        * **Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block brute-force attacks by identifying suspicious login patterns.

## Threat: [Exposure of `wp-config.php`](./threats/exposure_of__wp-config_php_.md)

* **Description:** The `wp-config.php` file, a core WordPress configuration file, contains sensitive information such as database credentials, security keys, and salts. If this file is publicly accessible due to web server misconfiguration, attackers can retrieve this information.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of `wp-config.php` is a critical security breach. Attackers gain direct access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data. The exposed security keys and salts can be used to compromise user sessions and perform other malicious actions.
    * **Affected Component:** WordPress Core Configuration Files (`wp-config.php`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure web server configuration:** Ensure the web server is configured to prevent direct access to `.php` files in the root directory, except for `index.php`. This is typically done through `.htaccess` (for Apache) or server block configurations (for Nginx).
        * **Move `wp-config.php` one level above the web root:** This is a common and effective security measure to prevent direct web access.
        * **Restrict file permissions:** Ensure appropriate file permissions are set on `wp-config.php` to prevent unauthorized access by the web server user.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in WordPress Core](./threats/privilege_escalation_vulnerability_in_wordpress_core.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the WordPress core codebase that allows a user with lower privileges (e.g., a subscriber or contributor) to gain higher-level access, potentially becoming an administrator. This exploits flaws in the core's user and role management system.
    * **Impact:** Successful privilege escalation grants attackers administrative control over the website. They can then perform any action an administrator can, including installing malicious plugins or themes, modifying content, accessing sensitive data, and potentially compromising the underlying server.
    * **Affected Component:** WordPress Core User and Role Management System (functions related to user authentication, authorization, and role assignment).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep WordPress core updated:** Security updates often include patches for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
        * **Follow the principle of least privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions required for their roles. Avoid assigning overly permissive roles.
        * **Regularly audit user roles and permissions:** Ensure that users have appropriate access levels and that no unauthorized privilege escalation has occurred.
        * **Monitor security advisories:** Stay informed about reported privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the WordPress core.
