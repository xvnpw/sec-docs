## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability (Core): [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability__core___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Leveraging vulnerable code execution paths within the WordPress core. This could involve exploiting flaws in how WordPress handles file uploads, image processing, or other functionalities that process external data. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **SQL Injection:** [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Injecting malicious SQL queries into database interactions performed by the WordPress core. This can occur when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in database queries. Successful injection can allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the WordPress database, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data breaches.
    * **Authentication Bypass:** [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Exploiting flaws in WordPress's authentication mechanisms. This could involve vulnerabilities in password reset processes, cookie handling, or other authentication-related code. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the application without valid credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities: [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Vulnerability in Plugin:** [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Similar to core RCE, but targeting vulnerabilities within specific plugins. This often involves flaws in how plugins handle user input, file uploads, or external API interactions.
        * **SQL Injection:** [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Injecting malicious SQL queries through plugin functionality. This is a common vulnerability in plugins that interact with the database without proper input sanitization.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** [HIGH RISK]
            * Injecting malicious scripts into web pages served by the plugin. This can occur when plugins display user-provided content without proper encoding or sanitization. Successful XSS attacks can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, or the redirection of users to malicious websites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Issues: [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_issues__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Leverage Misconfiguration:** [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]
        * **Gain Administrative Access:** [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Exploiting weak or default credentials for administrator accounts. This is a straightforward attack that can be successful if administrators do not change default passwords or use easily guessable ones.
            * Bypassing authentication mechanisms due to misconfigurations. This could involve exploiting improperly configured access controls or authentication settings.
        * **Data Breach:** [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Accessing sensitive data due to insecure file permissions. If WordPress files containing sensitive information (like configuration files) have overly permissive permissions, attackers can directly access them.
            * Exploiting exposed debug information. If debug mode is enabled in a production environment, it can reveal sensitive information like database credentials or internal paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Plugin/Theme Updates: [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_plugintheme_updates__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Compromising the plugin or theme developer's infrastructure to inject malicious code into legitimate updates. This is a supply chain attack where the attacker targets the source of the software rather than individual installations.
    * Compromising the plugin or theme repository accounts to upload malicious versions of the software. This allows attackers to distribute their malicious code to a wide range of users who trust the official update mechanisms.
