# Attack Surface Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within WordPress plugins, which are third-party extensions adding functionality.
*   **How WordPress Contributes:** WordPress's architecture heavily relies on plugins for extending functionality, making it a significant attack vector. The vast ecosystem and varying code quality of plugins increase the likelihood of vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A popular contact form plugin has an unpatched SQL injection vulnerability allowing attackers to extract database information.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, website defacement, malware injection, complete site takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:** Only install necessary plugins from reputable sources.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Regularly update all plugins to the latest versions.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Remove unused or outdated plugins.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Consider using security plugins that scan for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices when developing plugins, including input sanitization and parameterized queries.

## Attack Surface: [Theme Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/theme_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within WordPress themes, which control the website's appearance and presentation.
*   **How WordPress Contributes:** Similar to plugins, WordPress's theming system allows for custom themes, which can introduce vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
*   **Example:** A theme contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into pages viewed by users.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:** Use themes from reputable sources (official WordPress theme directory or well-known developers).
    *   **Developers/Users:** Keep themes updated.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Avoid using nulled or pirated themes.
    *   **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices when developing themes, especially when handling user input or displaying dynamic content.

## Attack Surface: [WordPress Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/wordpress_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the core WordPress codebase itself.
*   **How WordPress Contributes:** While the WordPress core team actively works on security, vulnerabilities can still be discovered in the complex codebase.
*   **Example:** A past version of WordPress had a vulnerability allowing for remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Impact:** Complete site takeover, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:** Keep WordPress core updated to the latest stable version.
    *   **Developers:** Contribute to WordPress security by reporting vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Attack Surface: [WordPress REST API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/wordpress_rest_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in the WordPress REST API, which allows programmatic access to WordPress data and functionalities.
*   **How WordPress Contributes:** The introduction of the REST API as a core feature expands the attack surface by providing new endpoints for interaction.
*   **Example:** An authentication bypass vulnerability in a specific REST API endpoint allows unauthorized access to user data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modifications, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:** Keep WordPress core updated.
    *   **Developers:** Implement proper authentication and authorization for API endpoints.
    *   **Developers:** Sanitize and validate input received through the API.
    *   **Developers:** Follow secure API development practices.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads (Often via Plugins/Themes)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads__often_via_pluginsthemes_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities allowing attackers to upload malicious files to the WordPress server.
*   **How WordPress Contributes:** WordPress's media library and plugin/theme functionalities that allow file uploads can be exploited if not implemented securely.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP backdoor script through a vulnerable plugin's file upload form.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation and sanitization on all file upload functionalities.
    *   **Developers:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible.
    *   **Developers:** Ensure proper permissions are set on uploaded files.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Regularly scan the uploads directory for suspicious files.

## Attack Surface: [Brute-Force Attacks on Login Page (`wp-login.php`)](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_login_page___wp-login_php__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempting to guess usernames and passwords to gain access to WordPress accounts.
*   **How WordPress Contributes:** The standard WordPress login page (`wp-login.php`) is a well-known entry point for attackers.
*   **Example:** Attackers use automated tools to try thousands of username/password combinations against the login page.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, including administrator accounts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:** Enforce strong password policies for WordPress user accounts, especially administrators.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).
    *   **Developers/Users:** Limit login attempts using plugins or server-level configurations.
    *   **Developers/Users:** Consider renaming the login page URL (security through obscurity, not a primary defense).
