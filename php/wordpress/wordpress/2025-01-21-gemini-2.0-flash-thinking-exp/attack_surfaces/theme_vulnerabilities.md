    *   **Theme-Specific Examples:**  Custom theme options allowing image uploads without proper checks on file type and content.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Directory Traversal:**
    *   **Mechanism:**  Occurs when themes allow access to files and directories outside the intended scope by manipulating file paths.
    *   **Theme-Specific Examples:**  Themes that handle file access based on user input without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, potential for code execution.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    *   **Mechanism:**  Arises when a theme makes requests to external resources based on user-controlled input without proper validation. Attackers can abuse this to scan internal networks or interact with internal services.
    *   **Theme-Specific Examples:**  Themes fetching data from external APIs based on user-provided URLs.
    *   **Impact:** Internal network reconnaissance, access to internal services, potential for further exploitation.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Issues:**
    *   **Mechanism:**  Themes might implement custom authentication or authorization mechanisms that are flawed, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive features or data.
    *   **Theme-Specific Examples:**  Themes with custom admin panels or settings pages that lack proper access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Themes might inadvertently expose sensitive information through comments, debug messages, or publicly accessible files.
    *   **Theme-Specific Examples:**  Themes including debugging code in production or leaving sensitive configuration files accessible.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data that can be used for further attacks.
