## Deep Analysis: Retrieve Database Credentials from `wp-config.php` (Attack Tree Path 1.3.3.2)

**Context:** This analysis focuses on a critical path within an attack tree targeting a WordPress application. The specific node, "Retrieve Database Credentials from `wp-config.php`," highlights a highly sensitive vulnerability where attackers aim to gain direct access to the WordPress database by obtaining the credentials stored in the `wp-config.php` file.

**Severity:** **CRITICAL**. Successful exploitation of this path grants the attacker complete control over the WordPress database, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences.

**Detailed Analysis of the Attack Vector:**

The core of this attack lies in accessing and reading the contents of the `wp-config.php` file. This file, located in the root directory of a WordPress installation, contains crucial configuration settings, including the database connection details:

*   `DB_NAME`: The name of the WordPress database.
*   `DB_USER`: The username used to connect to the database.
*   `DB_PASSWORD`: **The most critical piece of information**, the password for the database user.
*   `DB_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the database server.

Once an attacker retrieves these credentials, they bypass the WordPress application layer entirely and gain direct access to the underlying database.

**Common Techniques and Sub-Paths Leading to Accessing `wp-config.php`:**

While the provided path focuses on the retrieval itself, it's crucial to understand the various ways an attacker might achieve access to the `wp-config.php` file. These can be considered as preceding nodes in the larger attack tree:

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in PHP code that allow an attacker to include arbitrary files on the server. If not properly sanitized, an attacker can manipulate parameters to include `wp-config.php`.
*   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:** Similar to LFI, but focuses on manipulating file paths to access files outside the intended directory. Attackers might use sequences like `../` to navigate up the directory structure and access `wp-config.php`.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If the application makes requests to internal resources based on user input, an attacker might manipulate the request to target the local file system and retrieve `wp-config.php`.
*   **Direct Web Access due to Misconfiguration:** In some cases, web server configurations might incorrectly allow direct access to files like `wp-config.php`. This is a significant security oversight.
*   **Compromised Hosting Environment:** If the entire hosting environment is compromised (e.g., through SSH brute-forcing, control panel vulnerabilities), attackers can directly access the file system.
*   **Compromised WordPress Administrator Account:** While less direct, if an attacker gains administrator access to WordPress, they might be able to modify PHP files or use plugins to indirectly access `wp-config.php` or extract the database credentials.
*   **Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities:** Certain vulnerabilities might inadvertently leak the contents of files, including `wp-config.php`, through error messages or other unexpected outputs.
*   **Exploiting Backup Files:** Attackers might target publicly accessible backup files of the WordPress installation, which could contain `wp-config.php`.

**Impact of Successfully Retrieving Database Credentials:**

The consequences of an attacker successfully retrieving database credentials from `wp-config.php` are severe and far-reaching:

*   **Complete Database Control:** The attacker gains full control over the WordPress database, allowing them to:
    *   **Read Sensitive Data:** Access all user information (usernames, passwords, emails, personal details), post content, comments, and other application data.
    *   **Modify Data:** Alter existing content, inject malicious code into posts or pages, change user roles and permissions.
    *   **Delete Data:** Erase critical information, potentially crippling the website.
    *   **Create New Users:** Add malicious administrator accounts for persistent access.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the website's content and appearance to display malicious messages or propaganda.
*   **Malware Injection:** Inject malicious scripts or code into the database, which can then be served to website visitors, leading to further compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has broader privileges beyond the WordPress database, the attacker might be able to pivot and compromise other systems.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data from the database for malicious purposes, such as selling it on the dark web or using it for identity theft.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By manipulating or deleting data, attackers can render the website unusable.
*   **Complete Takeover of the WordPress Installation:** With database access, attackers can effectively control the entire WordPress application.

**Detection and Prevention Strategies:**

Preventing the retrieval of database credentials from `wp-config.php` is paramount. Here are key strategies:

*   **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure that `wp-config.php` has restrictive file permissions (e.g., 600 or 640) so that only the web server user can read it. Prevent public access.
*   **Web Server Configuration Hardening:**
    *   **Disable Directory Listing:** Prevent attackers from browsing directories and potentially finding `wp-config.php`.
    *   **Block Direct Access to Sensitive Files:** Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to explicitly deny access to `wp-config.php` and other sensitive files.
    *   **Use `.htaccess` (Apache) or `nginx.conf` rules:** Implement rules to block access to `wp-config.php` based on file extension or specific file name.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent LFI, path traversal, and SSRF vulnerabilities that could lead to accessing `wp-config.php`.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited to access `wp-config.php`.
*   **Keep WordPress Core, Themes, and Plugins Updated:** Regularly update all components to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests that attempt to access sensitive files.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user used by WordPress has only the necessary privileges required for its operation, limiting the impact if the credentials are compromised.
*   **Move `wp-config.php` (Advanced):** While not a standard practice, some advanced configurations involve moving `wp-config.php` one level above the web root. This requires careful configuration and understanding of the implications.
*   **Monitor for Suspicious File Access:** Implement monitoring tools to detect unusual access patterns to sensitive files like `wp-config.php`.
*   **Secure Hosting Environment:** Choose a reputable hosting provider with strong security measures and ensure the server is properly configured and secured.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for WordPress Admin Accounts:** While not directly preventing access to `wp-config.php`, it reduces the likelihood of administrator accounts being compromised, which could indirectly lead to accessing the file.

**Impact on Development Team:**

This analysis highlights the critical importance of secure coding practices and robust security configurations for the development team. They need to:

*   **Prioritize Security in the Development Lifecycle:** Integrate security considerations into every stage of development.
*   **Implement Secure Coding Practices:** Avoid introducing vulnerabilities like LFI, path traversal, and SSRF.
