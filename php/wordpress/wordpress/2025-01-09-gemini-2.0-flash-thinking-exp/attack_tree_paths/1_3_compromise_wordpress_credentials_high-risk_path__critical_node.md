## Deep Analysis: Compromise WordPress Credentials (Attack Tree Path 1.3)

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the attack tree path "1.3 Compromise WordPress Credentials," identified as a **HIGH-RISK PATH** and a **CRITICAL NODE** within the attack tree for a WordPress application. This signifies that successfully achieving this step has severe consequences and is a primary goal for many attackers targeting WordPress sites.

**Target:** WordPress application (using https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress)

**Attack Tree Path:** 1.3 Compromise WordPress Credentials

**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Criticality:** CRITICAL NODE

**Analysis:**

Compromising WordPress credentials is a cornerstone of many successful attacks against WordPress sites. Gaining access to legitimate user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, allows attackers to bypass many security measures and achieve a wide range of malicious objectives. This path is considered high-risk and critical because it directly leads to significant control over the application and its data.

**Detailed Breakdown of Potential Attack Vectors within Path 1.3:**

This path encompasses various methods an attacker might employ to obtain valid WordPress login credentials. We can categorize these vectors as follows:

**1. Direct Attacks on Login Mechanisms:**

* **1.3.1 Brute-Force Attacks:**
    * **Description:**  Systematically trying numerous username and password combinations against the WordPress login page (`wp-login.php`).
    * **Tools:**  `hydra`, `wpscan`, custom scripts.
    * **Indicators:**  High volume of failed login attempts from a single IP or range, unusual login activity patterns.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce complex and unique passwords.
        * **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement temporary or permanent lockout after a certain number of failed attempts.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of login attempts from a specific IP address within a given timeframe.
        * **CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA:**  Implement challenges to distinguish between human and automated login attempts.
        * **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Require a second factor of authentication beyond username and password.
        * **Security Plugins:** Utilize plugins like Wordfence, Sucuri Security, or All In One WP Security & Firewall that offer brute-force protection.
        * **Custom Login URL:** Change the default `wp-login.php` URL to obscure the login page.
* **1.3.2 Credential Stuffing:**
    * **Description:**  Using lists of previously compromised usernames and passwords (often obtained from breaches of other websites) to attempt logins on the WordPress site. Attackers assume users reuse credentials across multiple platforms.
    * **Tools:**  Custom scripts, automated bots.
    * **Indicators:**  Successful logins from unusual locations or devices using known compromised credentials.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Strong Password Policies:**  Encourage users to use unique passwords for each website.
        * **Password Breach Monitoring:**  Implement systems to check if user credentials have been exposed in known data breaches (e.g., using Have I Been Pwned API).
        * **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Significantly reduces the effectiveness of credential stuffing.
        * **Educate Users:**  Raise awareness about the risks of password reuse.

**2. Exploiting Vulnerabilities:**
