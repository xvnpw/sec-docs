This high-level node in the attack tree represents the attacker's goal of altering the settings and parameters that govern the behavior and security of the WordPress installation. Successful manipulation can lead to a wide range of malicious outcomes, from subtle disruptions to complete site takeover.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors within "1.5 Manipulate WordPress Configuration":**

To achieve the goal of manipulating the WordPress configuration, an attacker can employ various techniques targeting different components of the system. Here's a detailed breakdown of potential attack vectors:

**1.5.1 Direct Access to `wp-config.php`:**

* **Description:** The `wp-config.php` file is the heart of a WordPress installation, containing crucial database credentials, security salts, and other sensitive settings. Direct access allows for immediate and significant configuration changes.
* **Attack Techniques:**
    * **Exploiting Web Server Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Directory Traversal:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to navigate outside the web root and access the `wp-config.php` file. This could involve crafting specific URLs containing `../` sequences.
        * **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Leveraging vulnerabilities in PHP scripts or other server-side components to include and read the contents of `wp-config.php`. This often involves manipulating parameters in requests to include the file path.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, allowing direct file access. This can be achieved through various vulnerabilities in the web server, PHP, or other installed software.
    * **Misconfigured Web Server Permissions:** Incorrect file permissions on the `wp-config.php` file or its parent directories, allowing unauthorized read access by the web server user or other users on the system.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Accidental exposure of the `wp-config.php` file through misconfigured backups, public repositories (e.g., Git where `.env` or similar files are not properly ignored), or error messages that reveal file paths.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising plugins or themes that have the ability to read or modify files on the server, including `wp-config.php`. This could be through vulnerabilities in the plugin/theme itself or through a compromised developer account.
* **Impact:**
    * **Database Compromise:** Obtaining database credentials allows direct access and manipulation of the WordPress database.
    * **Security Salt Compromise:**  Leads to the ability to generate valid cookies, potentially bypassing authentication and impersonating users.
    * **Site Takeover:** Modifying `WP_SITEURL` and `WP_HOME` can redirect the site to a malicious domain.
    * **Disabling Security Features:**  Changing settings like `WP_DEBUG` or disabling plugin updates.

**1.5.2 Database Manipulation:**

* **Description:** The WordPress configuration is largely stored within the database. Directly manipulating database tables can alter settings without accessing the `wp-config.php` file.
* **Attack Techniques:**
    * **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in WordPress core, plugins, or themes to inject malicious SQL queries and modify database records. This can target the `wp_options` table, which stores various configuration settings.
        * **Example:** Injecting SQL to update the `siteurl` or `home` options in the `wp_options` table.
    * **Compromised Database Credentials:** Obtaining database credentials through vulnerabilities in `wp-config.php` or other means allows direct database access using tools like `mysql` or phpMyAdmin.
    * **Exploiting Database Server Vulnerabilities:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the database server software itself (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB) to gain unauthorized access and manipulate data.
* **Impact:**
    * **Modifying `wp_options` table:**  Altering critical settings like admin email, site URL, default roles, and security parameters.
    * **Creating Malicious Admin Users:**  Adding new administrator accounts with full control over the WordPress site.
    * **Injecting Malicious Code:**  Inserting malicious scripts or code into database fields that are later rendered on the website.
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  Accessing and exporting sensitive data stored in the database.

**1.5.3 WordPress Admin Panel Access (Post-Authentication):**

* **Description:** Once an attacker gains access to a legitimate WordPress administrator account (through credential theft, brute-forcing, or other means), they can directly manipulate the configuration through the WordPress admin panel.
* **Attack Techniques:**
    * **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting numerous username/password combinations to guess valid credentials.
    * **Credential Stuffing:**  Using compromised credentials obtained from other data breaches.
    * **Exploiting Authentication Vulnerabilities:**  Targeting flaws in the WordPress login process or related authentication mechanisms.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing active user sessions to bypass authentication.
    * **Social Engineering:**  Tricking legitimate users into revealing their credentials.
* **Impact:**
    * **Changing Site Settings:**  Modifying general settings, reading settings, permalinks, etc.
    * **Plugin and Theme Manipulation:**  Installing malicious plugins or themes, activating/deactivating existing ones, and modifying their settings.
    * **User Management:**  Creating, deleting, or modifying user accounts and their roles.
    * **Content Manipulation:**  Modifying posts, pages, and other content to inject malicious code or spread misinformation.
    * **Installing Backdoors:**  Adding malicious code or creating new administrative accounts for future exploitation.

**1.5.4 Exploiting Vulnerable Plugins and Themes:**

* **Description:** Plugins and themes are common attack vectors in WordPress. Vulnerabilities in these components can allow attackers to manipulate the configuration indirectly.
* **Attack Techniques:**
    * **Unpatched Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting known security flaws in outdated or poorly coded plugins and themes. This can range from SQL injection to arbitrary file uploads.
    * **Malicious Plugins/Themes:**  Installing compromised or intentionally malicious plugins/themes that provide backdoor access or allow configuration changes.
    * **Plugin/Theme Option Manipulation:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow attackers to modify plugin or theme settings, potentially affecting core WordPress functionality or introducing malicious code.
* **Impact:**
    * **Indirect `wp-config.php` Manipulation:** Some plugins might have functionalities that allow them to read or modify the `wp-config.php` file.
    * **Database Manipulation via Plugins:**  Vulnerable plugins can be exploited to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    * **Admin Panel Access through Plugin Vulnerabilities:**  Some plugin vulnerabilities can lead to privilege escalation or direct access to administrative functions.

**Potential Impacts of Successful Configuration Manipulation:**

* **Complete Site Takeover:**  Changing admin credentials, site URL, and other critical settings can lock out legitimate users and give the attacker full control.
* **Data Breaches:**  Modifying database connection details to redirect data to attacker-controlled servers or injecting code to exfiltrate data.
