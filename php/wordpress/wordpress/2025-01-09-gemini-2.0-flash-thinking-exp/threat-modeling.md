# Threat Model Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Threat: [Exploitation of WordPress Core Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_wordpress_core_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability within the WordPress core codebase. This could involve sending crafted requests to trigger a bug, injecting malicious code through vulnerable input fields, or manipulating data in a way that leads to unintended execution.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server, data breaches through SQL Injection enabling access to sensitive database information, website defacement or user data theft via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Affected Component:** WordPress Core - various modules and functions depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., `wp-includes/pluggable.php`, `wp-db.php`, specific API endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE and SQL Injection), High (for XSS).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep WordPress core updated to the latest version.
*   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests.
*   Use security headers to mitigate certain types of attacks (e.g., XSS).
*   Regularly audit WordPress core files for unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Compromise via Outdated WordPress Core](./threats/compromise_via_outdated_wordpress_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker targets a website running an outdated version of WordPress, exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities for which patches are available in newer versions. Automated tools and scripts are often used to scan for and exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Similar to exploiting core vulnerabilities, leading to RCE, SQL Injection, data breaches, and website defacement. The impact is often widespread due to the nature of core vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** WordPress Core - the entire codebase of the outdated version.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the age and severity of the unpatched vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement automatic updates for WordPress core (if feasible and well-tested).
*   Regularly check for and apply WordPress core updates.
*   Subscribe to WordPress security advisories and news.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/insecure_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in WordPress's file upload mechanisms to upload malicious files, such as PHP web shells. These shells allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, allowing the attacker to control the website, access sensitive data, install malware, or use the server for malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** WordPress Core - `wp-includes/functions.php` (and related upload handling functions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict file upload types to only necessary and safe formats.
*   Implement strong file validation on the server-side.
*   Sanitize uploaded filenames.
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism.
*   Disable script execution in the uploads directory.

## Threat: [Exploitation of WordPress REST API Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_wordpress_rest_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the WordPress REST API to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify content, or even execute code depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, content manipulation, potential privilege escalation, and in some cases, remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** WordPress Core - REST API endpoints (e.g., `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`, `/wp-json/wp/v2/users`).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep WordPress core updated.
*   Restrict access to the REST API to only necessary endpoints and users.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Use rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on API endpoints.

## Threat: [WP-CLI Vulnerabilities Leading to Server Compromise](./threats/wp-cli_vulnerabilities_leading_to_server_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the server (e.g., through a compromised account or other vulnerabilities) exploits vulnerabilities in the WP-CLI (WordPress Command Line Interface) to execute arbitrary commands, manipulate the database, or gain further control over the WordPress installation.

**Impact:** Full control over the WordPress installation, potential access to the underlying server, data manipulation, and website defacement.

**Affected Component:** WP-CLI - various commands and functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if server access is already achieved).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to WP-CLI to authorized users only.
*   Keep WP-CLI updated.
*   Secure the server environment to prevent unauthorized access.
