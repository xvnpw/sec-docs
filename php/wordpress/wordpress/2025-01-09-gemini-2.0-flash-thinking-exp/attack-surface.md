# Attack Surface Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Attack Surface: [Brute-Force Attacks on the Login Page (`/wp-login.php` or `/wp-admin`)](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_the_login_page___wp-login_php__or__wp-admin__.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to guess usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to the WordPress admin dashboard.

**How WordPress Contributes:** The default and well-known login page location makes it a prime target for automated brute-force attacks. The core system, by default, doesn't have strong built-in protection against repeated login attempts.

**Example:** Attackers use automated scripts to try thousands of username/password combinations against the `/wp-login.php` page.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the website, leading to content manipulation, malware injection, or complete website takeover.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use strong and unique passwords for all user accounts, especially administrator accounts.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Limit login attempts using plugins or server-level configurations.
*   Implement CAPTCHA on the login page.
*   Rename the default login URL (though this is security through obscurity and should be used in conjunction with other methods).

## Attack Surface: [Exploitable Vulnerabilities in the WordPress Core](./attack_surfaces/exploitable_vulnerabilities_in_the_wordpress_core.md)

**Description:** Security flaws discovered within the core WordPress codebase itself.

**How WordPress Contributes:** The complexity of the codebase means that new flaws can be discovered. Older, unpatched versions are particularly vulnerable.

**Example:** A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is found in an older version of WordPress, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breaches, website defacement, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (when actively exploited)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep WordPress core updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor security advisories and apply patches promptly.

## Attack Surface: [WordPress REST API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/wordpress_rest_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in the WordPress REST API endpoints, allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

**How WordPress Contributes:** The built-in REST API, while providing valuable functionality, exposes data and actions through publicly accessible endpoints. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in these endpoints can be exploited.

**Example:** An unauthenticated REST API endpoint allows attackers to enumerate user accounts or modify post content.

**Impact:** Data breaches, content manipulation, unauthorized actions, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep WordPress updated to patch known REST API vulnerabilities.
*   Restrict access to sensitive REST API endpoints.
*   Use proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for API requests.
*   Disable REST API endpoints if they are not needed.

## Attack Surface: [File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (Local and Remote)](./attack_surfaces/file_inclusion_vulnerabilities__local_and_remote_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server.

**How WordPress Contributes:**  Improper handling of file paths or user-supplied input in WordPress core can lead to these vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A vulnerability in WordPress core allows an attacker to include and execute sensitive files on the server, potentially revealing configuration details or even executing code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, website compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure WordPress core is updated.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization where WordPress core handles file paths.
*   Avoid directly including files based on user input within custom development.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** Allowing users to upload files without proper validation, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.

**How WordPress Contributes:** WordPress's media library functionality, if not handled securely, can be a source of insecure file uploads.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in WordPress's media upload process to upload a PHP file, which they then execute to gain control of the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, website compromise, malware distribution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate file types and extensions rigorously within WordPress upload handling.
*   Rename uploaded files to prevent direct execution.
*   Store uploaded files in a directory with restricted execution permissions.
