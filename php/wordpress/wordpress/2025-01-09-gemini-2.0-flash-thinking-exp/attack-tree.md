*   **Attack Vector:**  A sophisticated attack where attackers compromise the plugin or theme developer's infrastructure and inject malicious code into legitimate updates. Users who update their plugins/themes unknowingly install the compromised version.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Compromise WordPress Credentials **HIGH-RISK PATH**, **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_compromise_wordpress_credentials_high-risk_path__critical_node.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Brute-Force Attack on Login Page **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_brute-force_attack_on_login_page_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use automated tools to try numerous username and password combinations against the WordPress login page (`wp-login.php`). If weak or default credentials are used, the attacker can gain access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Exploit Weak Password Reset Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_exploit_weak_password_reset_mechanism.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2.2 Manipulate Password Reset Process to Gain Access **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_2_manipulate_password_reset_process_to_gain_access_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting flaws in the password reset functionality, such as:
    *   Predictable reset tokens.
    *   Lack of proper verification of the user's identity.
    *   Ability to intercept or redirect password reset emails.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.3 Access `wp-config.php` **HIGH-RISK PATH**, **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_3_access__wp-config_php__high-risk_path__critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to access the `wp-config.php` file, which contains sensitive information, including database credentials. This can be achieved through vulnerabilities like:
    *   Path Traversal: Exploiting flaws in file handling to access files outside the intended directory.
    *   Local File Inclusion (LFI): Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow the inclusion of local files.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.3.2 Retrieve Database Credentials from `wp-config.php` **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_3_2_retrieve_database_credentials_from__wp-config_php__critical_node.md)
