# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update WordPress Core](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_wordpress_core.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor WordPress Updates:** Stay informed about new WordPress releases by following the official WordPress blog, security mailing lists, or the WordPress.org updates page. These sources announce new versions, including security patches.
    2.  **Access Updates Dashboard:** Log in to the WordPress admin dashboard and navigate to `Dashboard -> Updates`. WordPress will display available core updates.
    3.  **Backup Before Updating:** Before initiating any update, create a full backup of your WordPress website, including files and the database. This allows for easy restoration in case of update failures or compatibility issues.
    4.  **Initiate Update:** Click the "Update Now" button for core updates. For major updates, carefully review the release notes and compatibility information before proceeding.
    5.  **Verify Update Success:** After the update process completes, check the WordPress version in the admin dashboard (`Dashboard -> At a Glance`) to confirm the update was successful. Test key functionalities of your website to ensure no regressions were introduced.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Core Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  WordPress core, like any software, can have security vulnerabilities. Updates from https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress often include patches for these vulnerabilities. Failing to update leaves your site vulnerable to known exploits targeting these core flaws.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Core Vulnerabilities:** **High Impact**. Directly addresses and significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities within the WordPress core codebase.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. WordPress core provides update notifications and a one-click update mechanism within the admin dashboard. Automatic minor updates are also a core feature.
    *   **Location:** WordPress Admin Dashboard -> Updates, Core update mechanism within `wp-admin/includes/update-core.php` and related files in the WordPress core codebase on GitHub.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Proactive monitoring of update announcements and a disciplined process for testing and applying major core updates in a timely manner might be missing in some projects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Automatic Background Updates](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_automatic_background_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `wp-config.php`:** Open the `wp-config.php` file in your WordPress installation.
    2.  **Define `WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE` Constant:** Add or modify the `WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE` constant to control automatic core updates:
        *   `define( 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', true );` : Enables automatic updates for all core updates (major and minor). **Use with caution and thorough testing.**
        *   `define( 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', 'minor' );` : (Default) Enables automatic updates only for minor releases and security updates. **Recommended for most sites.**
        *   `define( 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', false );` : Disables all automatic core updates. **Not recommended for security.**
    3.  **Save Changes:** Save the `wp-config.php` file. WordPress core will then handle automatic updates based on this configuration.
    4.  **Monitor for Update Issues:** While automatic updates are convenient, periodically check for any errors or issues that might arise from automatic updates. Review server logs or use plugins that provide update monitoring.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Core Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Automatic updates ensure that critical security patches released by the WordPress core team on https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress are applied rapidly, minimizing the window of vulnerability.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Medium Severity):** While not a direct mitigation against zero-days *before* a patch, automatic updates drastically reduce the time a site remains vulnerable *after* a patch is released for newly discovered core exploits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Core Vulnerabilities:** **High Impact**.  Significantly reduces the time window of vulnerability to known core exploits by automating the patching process.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** **Medium Impact**.  Reduces exposure time after a patch becomes available from the WordPress core team.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Automatic minor updates are often enabled by default in newer WordPress installations, reflecting a core security feature.
    *   **Location:** Configuration via `wp-config.php`, core update logic within `wp-admin/includes/class-wp-automatic-updater.php` and related files in the WordPress core codebase on GitHub.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Full automation for major updates (if desired and with robust testing) might be missing.  Users might not be aware of the `WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE` options and might be relying on manual updates only, increasing risk.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable File Editing in WordPress Admin](./mitigation_strategies/disable_file_editing_in_wordpress_admin.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `wp-config.php`:** Open the `wp-config.php` file in your WordPress root directory.
    2.  **Add `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` Constant:** Insert the following line into `wp-config.php`:
        ```php
        define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true );
        ```
    3.  **Save `wp-config.php`:** Save the changes to the file.
    4.  **Verify in Admin Dashboard:** Log in to the WordPress admin dashboard. Navigate to `Appearance -> Theme Editor` and `Plugins -> Plugin Editor`. These menu options should now be absent, indicating file editing is disabled as configured by the core.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Code Injection via Admin Account Compromise (High Severity):** If an attacker compromises an administrator account (a vulnerability often exploited in WordPress sites), disabling file editing in the core prevents them from directly modifying theme or plugin files through the admin interface to inject malicious code into the core WordPress installation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Code Injection via Admin Account Compromise:** **High Impact**.  Significantly reduces the risk of code injection via compromised admin accounts by leveraging a core WordPress configuration option to restrict file modification.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Often implemented in security-focused WordPress projects as it's a straightforward hardening step configurable via a core constant.
    *   **Location:** Configuration via `wp-config.php`, core logic in `wp-admin/includes/file.php` and related files within the WordPress core codebase on GitHub that checks for this constant.
*   **Missing Implementation:** May be missing in projects prioritizing ease of theme/plugin customization via the admin panel over security, or where default WordPress security hardening isn't prioritized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `wp-config.php` File](./mitigation_strategies/secure__wp-config_php__file.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set File Permissions:** Ensure `wp-config.php` has restrictive file permissions. Using FTP/SFTP or server command line, set permissions to `600` (owner read/write) or `640` (owner read/write, group read). This restricts access to the file at the server level.
    2.  **Move `wp-config.php` Above Web Root (Recommended):** If server configuration allows, move `wp-config.php` one directory level above the web root. WordPress core is designed to look for `wp-config.php` in the parent directory if not found in the root, enhancing security by making it inaccessible via web requests.
    3.  **Utilize Strong Salts and Keys:** During WordPress installation or by manually editing `wp-config.php`, ensure strong, unique, and randomly generated salts and keys are used. Obtain these from the WordPress.org secret-key service if needed and replace the existing ones in `wp-config.php`. These are used by core WordPress for password hashing and cookie encryption.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via `wp-config.php` Access (High Severity):** If `wp-config.php` is accessible via the web (due to server misconfiguration or vulnerability), attackers can retrieve sensitive information like database credentials, salts, and keys, leading to complete compromise of the WordPress installation. Securing the file directly mitigates this core vulnerability.
    *   **Brute-force Attacks on Passwords (Medium Severity):** Strong salts and keys, a core security feature of WordPress, make password brute-force attacks significantly more difficult by increasing the computational cost of cracking password hashes generated by the core.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via `wp-config.php` Access:** **High Impact**.  Restricting access via permissions and moving the file effectively prevents direct web access and information leakage of critical core configuration data.
    *   **Brute-force Attacks on Passwords:** **Medium Impact**.  Enhances the security of WordPress's core password hashing mechanism, making brute-force attacks less effective.
*   **Currently Implemented:** File permissions are often correctly set by hosting providers. Strong salts and keys are generated by core during installation. Moving `wp-config.php` is less commonly implemented.
    *   **Location:** Server file system permissions, `wp-config.php`, core installation process in `wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php` and related files within the WordPress core codebase on GitHub.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Moving `wp-config.php` above the web root is often missed.  Regular audits of file permissions and ensuring strong salts/keys are in place might also be overlooked in some deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable XML-RPC if not needed](./mitigation_strategies/disable_xml-rpc_if_not_needed.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess XML-RPC Usage:** Determine if your WordPress site requires XML-RPC functionality. If you are not using WordPress mobile apps, remote publishing tools that rely on XML-RPC, or pingbacks/trackbacks, you likely do not need it.
    2.  **Disable via Core Filter:** Add the following code snippet to your theme's `functions.php` file or a custom plugin:
        ```php
        add_filter('xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false');
        ```
        This utilizes a core WordPress filter to disable XML-RPC functionality.
    3.  **Verify:** After implementing the filter, attempt to access `xmlrpc.php` in your browser (e.g., `yourdomain.com/xmlrpc.php`). It should return an XML-RPC error message indicating that XML-RPC is disabled by the core.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XML-RPC Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** `xmlrpc.php`, a core WordPress file, can be a target for brute-force attacks to guess user credentials. Disabling XML-RPC at the core level eliminates this attack vector.
    *   **XML-RPC Amplification Attacks (Medium Severity):** Attackers can exploit `xmlrpc.php` to send numerous pingback requests, potentially overloading other servers in DDoS-like attacks and consuming your server's resources. Disabling XML-RPC core functionality prevents this.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XML-RPC Brute-Force Attacks:** **Medium Impact**.  Removes a specific attack vector targeting core WordPress files for credential brute-forcing.
    *   **XML-RPC Amplification Attacks:** **Medium Impact**.  Prevents your server from being exploited via a core WordPress component for amplification attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Disabling XML-RPC is often implemented in security-conscious projects. WordPress core provides the `xmlrpc_enabled` filter specifically for this purpose.
    *   **Location:** Theme's `functions.php` or custom plugin, core XML-RPC handling logic in `wp-includes/xmlrpc.php` and related files within the WordPress core codebase on GitHub.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Many sites may still have XML-RPC enabled by default if administrators are unaware of the security risks or haven't explicitly disabled it using the core filter mechanism.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden the REST API](./mitigation_strategies/harden_the_rest_api.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Access (If Possible):** If the WordPress REST API is not required for public access, restrict access using server-level configurations (e.g., web server rules) or WordPress plugins that control REST API access.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints:** WordPress core exposes various REST API endpoints. Disable endpoints that are not essential for your site's functionality, especially those that could expose sensitive information or be used for user enumeration. Plugins or custom code can be used to deregister unnecessary core REST API routes.
    3.  **Implement Authentication and Authorization:** For REST API endpoints that require access control, ensure proper authentication (verifying user identity) and authorization (verifying user permissions) are implemented. WordPress core provides mechanisms for REST API authentication.
    4.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for REST API requests to mitigate brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts targeting core REST API endpoints. This can be done at the server level or using WordPress plugins.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **REST API Exploitation (Medium to High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in the WordPress REST API (part of core) can be exploited for various attacks, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and denial of service. Hardening the API reduces the attack surface.
    *   **REST API Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** REST API endpoints, especially authentication endpoints, can be targeted for brute-force attacks. Rate limiting mitigates this.
    *   **Information Disclosure via REST API (Medium Severity):**  Unsecured or improperly configured REST API endpoints can inadvertently expose sensitive information from the WordPress core database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **REST API Exploitation:** **Medium to High Impact**. Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities within the WordPress core REST API.
    *   **REST API Brute-Force Attacks:** **Medium Impact**.  Mitigates brute-force attempts against REST API authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Information Disclosure via REST API:** **Medium Impact**.  Reduces the risk of unintentional data exposure through core REST API endpoints.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. WordPress core provides authentication and authorization mechanisms for the REST API. However, default configurations might not be sufficiently hardened for all use cases.
    *   **Location:** WordPress REST API core files in `wp-includes/rest-api/`, `wp-includes/rest-api.php`, and related files within the WordPress core codebase on GitHub.  Authentication and authorization logic within core REST API functions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Restrictive access controls, disabling unnecessary endpoints, and robust rate limiting for the core REST API are often not implemented by default and require manual configuration or plugins.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protect the Login Page (`wp-login.php`)](./mitigation_strategies/protect_the_login_page___wp-login_php__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Rate Limiting:** Use plugins or server-level configurations to limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a specific timeframe. This directly protects the core `wp-login.php` file from brute-force attacks.
    2.  **Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enable 2FA for all administrator and editor accounts. WordPress core does not natively include 2FA, but plugins can easily add this functionality, enhancing security for core user accounts.
    3.  **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Encourage or enforce strong and unique passwords for all WordPress user accounts. WordPress core has a basic password strength meter, but plugins can provide more robust password policies.
    4.  **Rename Login URL (Security through obscurity, optional):** While not a primary security measure, renaming the default login URL (`wp-login.php`) to a custom one can deter basic automated attacks targeting the default core login path. Plugins or server configurations can achieve this.
    5.  **Implement CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA:** Add CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA to the login page (`wp-login.php`) to prevent automated bot attacks. Plugins are typically used to integrate CAPTCHA with the core login form.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Login Page (High Severity):** `wp-login.php`, a core WordPress file, is a primary target for brute-force attacks attempting to guess user credentials. Protecting this page is crucial.
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks (Medium Severity):** If user credentials are leaked from other services, attackers may try to use them on the WordPress login page. Strong passwords and 2FA mitigate this.
    *   **Automated Bot Attacks (Medium Severity):** Bots can be used to attempt logins or exploit login-related vulnerabilities. CAPTCHA helps prevent automated attacks on the core login page.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Login Page:** **High Impact**.  Rate limiting and other protections significantly reduce the effectiveness of brute-force attacks against the core login mechanism.
    *   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:** **Medium Impact**. Strong passwords and 2FA make credential stuffing less likely to succeed against core user accounts.
    *   **Automated Bot Attacks:** **Medium Impact**. CAPTCHA effectively blocks many automated login attempts targeting the core login page.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. WordPress core has basic password strength indication. However, rate limiting, 2FA, CAPTCHA, and login URL renaming are typically implemented via plugins or server-level configurations, extending the security of the core login functionality.
    *   **Location:** Core login logic in `wp-login.php` and related files within the WordPress core codebase on GitHub. Security enhancements are usually added via plugins or external configurations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Robust rate limiting, mandatory 2FA, enforced strong password policies, and CAPTCHA on the login page are often missing in default WordPress setups and require proactive implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Remove WordPress Version Information](./mitigation_strategies/remove_wordpress_version_information.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Remove from Header Meta Tag:** Add the following code to your theme's `functions.php` file or a custom plugin to remove the version meta tag from the `<head>` section of your website:
        ```php
        remove_action('wp_head', 'wp_generator');
        ```
        This utilizes a core WordPress action hook to remove the generator meta tag that exposes the version.
    2.  **Remove from RSS Feeds:** Add this code to `functions.php` to remove the version from RSS feeds:
        ```php
        add_filter('the_generator', '__return_empty_string');
        ```
        This uses a core WordPress filter to empty the generator output in feeds.
    3.  **Remove from Admin Dashboard (Less Common, Advanced):**  While less common and more complex, you could potentially modify core admin files to further hide version information from less obvious locations, but this is generally not recommended due to update complexities. Focus on removing publicly visible version indicators.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure of WordPress Version (Low Severity):**  Exposing the WordPress version makes it slightly easier for attackers to identify if a site is running a vulnerable version of core WordPress. While not a direct vulnerability itself, it aids in reconnaissance for targeted attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure of WordPress Version:** **Low Impact**.  Reduces information leakage, making it slightly harder for attackers to identify vulnerable WordPress versions at a glance. Primarily a security through obscurity measure.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented by default. WordPress core, by default, outputs version information in meta tags and RSS feeds. Removing this requires manual configuration or plugins.
    *   **Location:** Core version generation in `wp-includes/general-template.php` and related files within the WordPress core codebase on GitHub. Removal is achieved via filters and actions applied in `functions.php` or plugins.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  By default, WordPress sites expose version information. Implementing the removal of version information requires proactive steps.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Uploads](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Allowed File Types:** WordPress core allows defining allowed file types for uploads. Configure this to only permit necessary file types (e.g., images, documents) and block executable file types (e.g., `.php`, `.exe`, `.sh`). This can be done using core filters or plugins.
    2.  **Implement File Validation:** WordPress core performs basic file type checks, but enhance this with more robust validation on the server-side to prevent uploading of malicious files disguised as allowed types. Plugins or custom code can implement deeper file content inspection.
    3.  **Store Uploads Outside Web Root (Advanced):** For maximum security, configure WordPress to store uploaded files outside of the web-accessible directory. This prevents direct execution of uploaded files even if vulnerabilities are found. This often requires server-level configuration and potentially custom WordPress code.
    4.  **Scan Uploaded Files for Malware:** Integrate malware scanning for uploaded files. While not a core feature, plugins can integrate with server-side malware scanners to automatically scan uploads before they are stored.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload and Execution (High Severity):** If attackers can upload and execute malicious files (e.g., PHP backdoors) through WordPress's core upload functionality, they can gain complete control of the website. Securing uploads is critical.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Uploaded Files (Medium Severity):**  Maliciously crafted files (e.g., SVG images with embedded JavaScript) can be uploaded and then trigger XSS vulnerabilities when accessed by users. File validation and sanitization mitigate this.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload and Execution:** **High Impact**.  Strict file type restrictions, validation, and storing uploads outside the web root significantly reduce the risk of malicious file execution via core upload mechanisms.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Uploaded Files:** **Medium Impact**. File validation and sanitization help prevent XSS vulnerabilities originating from uploaded files processed by core WordPress.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. WordPress core has basic file type checking and upload handling. However, more advanced security measures like deep file validation, storing outside web root, and malware scanning are not core features and require additional implementation.
    *   **Location:** Core upload handling in `wp-admin/includes/file.php`, `wp-includes/functions.php` and related files within the WordPress core codebase on GitHub. Security enhancements are typically added via plugins or custom code.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Robust file validation beyond basic type checks, storing uploads outside the web root, and integrated malware scanning are often missing in standard WordPress setups and require proactive security configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change the Default Database Table Prefix](./mitigation_strategies/change_the_default_database_table_prefix.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **During Installation:** When installing WordPress, during the database configuration step, change the default table prefix `wp_` to a unique and unpredictable prefix (e.g., `xyz_`, `customprefix_`, a randomly generated string).
    2.  **Manual Change (Advanced, Not Recommended for Beginners):**  Changing the table prefix after installation is a complex and risky process. It involves manually modifying the database to rename all tables and updating the `wp-config.php` file. This is generally not recommended unless you are an experienced WordPress administrator and understand the risks. It's best to set a custom prefix during initial installation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection Attacks (Low Severity - Mitigation is debated):** Changing the table prefix is a security through obscurity measure. It makes generic, automated SQL injection attacks that assume the default `wp_` prefix slightly harder to execute. However, it does not prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities themselves and is not a strong security measure against targeted attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection Attacks:** **Low Impact**.  Provides a minor layer of security through obscurity against automated SQL injection attempts. Does not address the root cause of SQL injection vulnerabilities in core or plugins/themes.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  The option to change the table prefix is presented during the WordPress installation process, making it a configurable aspect of core setup.
    *   **Location:** WordPress installation script in `wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php` and related files within the WordPress core codebase on GitHub. Configuration is stored in `wp-config.php`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** While the option is available during installation, many users may not realize the security implications or bother to change the default prefix, leaving it as `wp_`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Database Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/secure_database_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Strong Database Password:** When creating the WordPress database user, use a strong, unique, and randomly generated password. Avoid using easily guessable passwords.
    2.  **Restrict Database User Permissions:** Grant the WordPress database user only the necessary permissions required for WordPress to function. Avoid granting unnecessary privileges like `GRANT ALL`.  Typically, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, `INDEX`, `ALTER`, and `LOCK TABLES` are sufficient.
    3.  **Store Credentials Securely:** Database credentials are stored in `wp-config.php`. Follow the best practices for securing `wp-config.php` as described in mitigation strategy #4.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Database Breach via Compromised Credentials (High Severity):** Weak or compromised database credentials can allow attackers to directly access and manipulate the WordPress database, leading to data breaches, data corruption, and complete site compromise. Securing these credentials is paramount.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Database Breach via Compromised Credentials:** **High Impact**.  Strong passwords and restricted permissions significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized database access due to compromised credentials stored in core configuration files.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. WordPress core prompts for database credentials during installation. However, enforcing strong passwords and least privilege database permissions is the responsibility of the user or hosting provider.
    *   **Location:** Database configuration during WordPress installation, credentials stored in `wp-config.php`, core database interaction logic throughout the WordPress codebase on GitHub.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforcement of strong database passwords and least privilege permissions is not built into WordPress core itself and relies on external best practices and user awareness. Many users may use weak passwords or default database configurations, increasing risk.
