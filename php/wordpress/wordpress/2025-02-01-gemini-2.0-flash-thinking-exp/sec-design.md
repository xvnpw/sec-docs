# BUSINESS POSTURE

WordPress is an open-source Content Management System (CMS) focused on providing a flexible and user-friendly platform for creating and managing websites and online content.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Democratize publishing and make it accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skill.
  - Maintain a large and active open-source community to ensure continuous development, support, and innovation.
  - Provide a highly customizable and extensible platform through themes and plugins.
  - Ensure the platform is reliable, performant, and secure for millions of websites globally.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the core platform, themes, or plugins could lead to widespread website compromises and damage to user trust.
  - Scalability issues could impact the performance and availability of websites, especially during peak traffic.
  - Community fragmentation or decline could slow down development and innovation.
  - Competition from other CMS platforms and website builders could reduce market share.
  - Misuse of the platform for malicious purposes (e.g., hosting malware, spreading misinformation) could damage the reputation of WordPress and the open-source community.

# SECURITY POSTURE

WordPress, being a widely used open-source CMS, has a significant focus on security, but also faces inherent risks due to its extensibility and community-driven nature.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Regular security updates and patches for the core WordPress software. (Implemented by WordPress core development team and distributed through automatic updates and manual downloads).
  - security control: Plugin and theme security review process (partially implemented through the WordPress.org plugin/theme repository guidelines and community reviews, but not a formal security audit for all submissions).
  - security control: Security-focused development practices within the core team (documented in WordPress development guidelines and reflected in code commit history).
  - security control: User roles and permissions system to control access to administrative functions (implemented within WordPress core).
  - security control: Input sanitization and output escaping to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS (implemented throughout WordPress core, but plugin/theme developers are responsible for their code).
  - security control: Password hashing for user credentials (implemented within WordPress core using modern hashing algorithms).
  - security control: HTTPS support and recommendation for secure communication (documented in WordPress best practices and hosting requirements).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in third-party plugins and themes due to the vast and open nature of the ecosystem.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of WordPress instances by users leading to security weaknesses.
  - accepted risk: Social engineering attacks targeting WordPress administrators and users.
  - accepted risk: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against WordPress websites.
  - accepted risk: Brute-force attacks against login pages.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the WordPress core development pipeline.
  - security control: Enhance plugin and theme security review process with more rigorous automated and manual security checks before inclusion in the official repository.
  - security control: Provide more comprehensive security hardening guidelines and tools for WordPress administrators.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate the adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for WordPress user accounts.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and brute-force protection mechanisms at the server level to protect login pages.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure user authentication mechanism for administrators, editors, and other user roles. (Implemented by WordPress core user management system).
    - Requirement: Support for strong passwords and password complexity enforcement. (Partially implemented by WordPress core, plugins can enhance password policies).
    - Requirement: Consider integration with external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth, SAML) for enterprise environments. (Achieved through plugins).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to different functionalities. (Implemented by WordPress core user roles and capabilities system).
    - Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied when assigning user roles. (User responsibility during WordPress setup and administration).
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.). (Partially implemented by WordPress core, plugin/theme developers are responsible for their code).
    - Requirement: Validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side. (Best practice for web development, WordPress core focuses on server-side).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use of strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit. (Password hashing implemented in core, HTTPS for transit security is recommended).
    - Requirement: Secure storage and management of cryptographic keys if used for plugin functionalities (e.g., encryption plugins). (Plugin developer responsibility).
    - Requirement: Proper handling of sensitive data in code and logs to avoid exposure. (WordPress core development practice, plugin/theme developer responsibility).
