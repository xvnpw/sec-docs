# Threat Model Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Threat: [SQL Injection (SQLi) in Plugin](./threats/sql_injection__sqli__in_plugin.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a plugin's database queries. They inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database through vulnerable input fields, URL parameters, or cookies processed by the plugin.
- **Impact:** Data breach (sensitive data exfiltration), data manipulation (modification or deletion), website defacement, complete site takeover, potential server compromise.
- **WordPress Component Affected:** Specific Plugin (vulnerable code within the plugin)
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Developers: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database in plugins. Sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in database queries. Regularly audit plugin code for SQLi vulnerabilities. Use security scanning tools.
    - Users: Keep plugins updated to the latest versions. Choose plugins from reputable developers with a history of security updates. Remove unused plugins.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Theme](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_theme.md)

- **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a website page through a vulnerable theme. This code executes in the victim's browser when they visit the page. This can be achieved through vulnerable theme templates, comment sections, or user profile fields.
- **Impact:** Session hijacking (account takeover), website defacement, redirection to malicious websites, stealing user credentials or sensitive information, malware distribution.
- **WordPress Component Affected:** Specific Theme (vulnerable template files or functions)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Developers: Properly sanitize and escape all user-generated content and output within themes. Use WordPress escaping functions (e.g., `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `wp_kses_post()`). Regularly audit theme code for XSS vulnerabilities. Use security scanning tools.
    - Users: Keep themes updated to the latest versions. Choose themes from reputable developers with a history of security updates. Remove unused themes. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS impact.

## Threat: [File Upload Vulnerability in Plugin](./threats/file_upload_vulnerability_in_plugin.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a plugin's file upload functionality. They upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts or web shells, to the server if the plugin lacks proper file type validation, size limits, or secure storage locations.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) - complete server compromise, website defacement, data breach, denial of service.
- **WordPress Component Affected:** Specific Plugin (vulnerable file upload functionality)
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Developers: Implement strict file type validation (whitelist allowed extensions). Limit file sizes. Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible. Sanitize filenames. Prevent direct execution of uploaded files (e.g., using `.htaccess` or server configuration). Regularly audit plugin code for file upload vulnerabilities.
    - Users: Keep plugins updated to the latest versions. Choose plugins from reputable developers. Limit file upload functionality to trusted users only. Monitor file uploads and server logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Core Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_core_vulnerability.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the WordPress core authentication mechanism. They bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access to the WordPress admin panel or user accounts due to flaws in password reset processes, cookie handling, or session management within WordPress core.
- **Impact:** Complete site takeover, data breach, website defacement, denial of service, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.
- **WordPress Component Affected:** WordPress Core (authentication functions, user management system)
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Developers (WordPress Core Team):  Rigorous security audits and penetration testing of core authentication mechanisms. Prompt patching of identified vulnerabilities.
    - Users: Keep WordPress core updated to the latest versions. Enforce strong passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts. Monitor security advisories and apply security updates promptly.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation in Plugin](./threats/privilege_escalation_in_plugin.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a plugin to elevate their user privileges within WordPress. For example, a subscriber could gain administrator privileges due to flaws in role management, capability checks, or insecure plugin code.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functionalities, data manipulation, website defacement, potential site takeover.
- **WordPress Component Affected:** Specific Plugin (vulnerable role/permission management)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Developers: Implement proper role and capability checks in plugins. Avoid directly granting administrative privileges through plugins unless absolutely necessary. Regularly audit plugin code for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    - Users: Keep plugins updated to the latest versions. Review plugin permissions and capabilities. Limit the number of users with administrative privileges. Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugin or Theme - Abandoned and Unpatched](./threats/vulnerable_plugin_or_theme_-_abandoned_and_unpatched.md)

- **Description:** Using plugins or themes that are no longer actively maintained or updated by their developers. These components may contain known security vulnerabilities that are not patched, making the website vulnerable to exploitation.
- **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability type (SQLi, XSS, RCE, etc.), ranging from data breach to complete site takeover.
- **WordPress Component Affected:** Specific Plugin or Theme (outdated and unmaintained code)
- **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability type, can be critical)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Users: Regularly audit installed plugins and themes. Remove unused plugins and themes. Check the last update date and developer activity for plugins and themes before installation and periodically. Replace abandoned plugins and themes with actively maintained alternatives. Use security scanning tools to identify vulnerable components.
