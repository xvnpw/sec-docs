*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Protect `wp-config.php` WordPress File
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict File Permissions for `wp-config.php`:** Set strict file permissions (600 or 640) for the `wp-config.php` WordPress file.
    2.  **Move `wp-config.php` Outside WordPress Webroot (Advanced):** Consider moving `wp-config.php` one level above the webroot (requires careful configuration).
    3.  **`.htaccess` Protection for `wp-config.php` (If in Webroot):** If `wp-config.php` remains in webroot, use `.htaccess` to deny direct web access:
        ```
        <files wp-config.php>
        order allow,deny
        deny from all
        </files>
        ```
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive WordPress Configuration Data (High Severity):** `wp-config.php` contains sensitive WordPress data (database credentials, security keys).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive WordPress Configuration Data (High Reduction):** Restricting access to `wp-config.php` reduces unauthorized access risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. File permissions may not be strictly restricted. `.htaccess` protection likely exists. Moving `wp-config.php` outside webroot is not implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Verify and enforce strict file permissions for `wp-config.php`. Consider `.htaccess` protection if missing. Evaluate moving `wp-config.php` outside webroot (with caution).

## Mitigation Strategy: [21. Enable WordPress Security Logging](./mitigation_strategies/21__enable_wordpress_security_logging.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable WordPress Security Logging
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose WordPress Logging Method:** Select a WordPress security logging method (security plugins, server-level logs, limited WordPress core logging).
    2.  **Configure WordPress Logging Levels and Events:** Configure logging to capture relevant WordPress security events: login attempts, user changes, plugin/theme changes, file modifications, security alerts, 404 errors.
    3.  **Centralized WordPress Log Management (Recommended):** For larger deployments, use centralized log management (ELK, Graylog, Splunk) for WordPress logs.
    4.  **WordPress Log Retention Policy:** Define a log retention policy for WordPress security logs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed WordPress Incident Detection (High Severity):** Without WordPress security logging, incident detection is delayed.
    *   **Lack of WordPress Forensic Evidence (High Severity):** Without logs, WordPress incident investigation is challenging.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Delayed WordPress Incident Detection (High Reduction):** WordPress security logging enables timely incident detection.
    *   **Lack of WordPress Forensic Evidence (High Reduction):** WordPress logs provide forensic evidence for investigations.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic web server access logs are enabled. WordPress core error logs likely enabled. Security-specific WordPress logging is limited.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement comprehensive WordPress security logging using a plugin or centralized solution. Configure logging for relevant events and establish a log retention policy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [22. Regularly Monitor WordPress Security Logs](./mitigation_strategies/22__regularly_monitor_wordpress_security_logs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Monitor WordPress Security Logs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish WordPress Log Monitoring Schedule:** Define a schedule for reviewing WordPress security logs (daily, hourly, real-time).
    2.  **Automated WordPress Log Analysis (Recommended):** Implement automated log analysis or SIEM for WordPress logs.
    3.  **Manual WordPress Log Review:** Supplement automated analysis with manual WordPress log review.
    4.  **Define WordPress Alerting Thresholds:** Set up alerts for critical WordPress security events (failed logins, file modifications, malware).
    5.  **WordPress Incident Response Plan:** Develop an incident response plan for WordPress security alerts.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unnoticed WordPress Security Breaches (High Severity):** Without log monitoring, WordPress breaches can go unnoticed.
    *   **Slow WordPress Incident Response (High Severity):** Delayed detection leads to slower WordPress incident response.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unnoticed WordPress Security Breaches (High Reduction):** Regular WordPress log monitoring increases breach detection likelihood.
    *   **Slow WordPress Incident Response (High Reduction):** Enables faster WordPress incident response.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, WordPress security logs are not regularly monitored.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establish a process for regular WordPress security log monitoring. Implement automated analysis and alerting. Develop a WordPress incident response plan.
