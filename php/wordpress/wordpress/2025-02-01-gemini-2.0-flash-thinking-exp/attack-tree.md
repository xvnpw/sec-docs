                *   Action: Inject XSS payloads into input fields that are stored in the database and displayed to other users.
            *   Actionable Insight: Sanitize all user inputs before storing them in the database and displaying them on the website. Use output encoding to prevent XSS. **[CRITICAL NODE - Mitigation]**
        *   AND ── **Reflected XSS [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   OR ── **Craft Malicious URLs with XSS Payloads [HIGH RISK PATH]**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit WordPress Core Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_wordpress_core_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting security flaws within the WordPress core software itself.
*   **How it Works:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities (publicly disclosed or unpatched) in specific WordPress versions. They use readily available exploits or develop custom ones to leverage these weaknesses.
*   **Consequences:** Full website compromise, data breach (access to database), website defacement, malware distribution, denial of service, administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugintheme_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting security flaws within third-party WordPress plugins and themes.
*   **How it Works:** Similar to core vulnerabilities, attackers target known or unpatched vulnerabilities in plugins and themes. These are often easier to find and exploit due to varying development quality and update frequency.
*   **Consequences:** Website compromise, data access, defacement, malware distribution, potentially administrative access depending on the plugin/theme vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Circumventing or breaking WordPress authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:** Attackers attempt to guess usernames and passwords using automated tools or lists of leaked credentials.
    *   **Session Hijacking/Fixation (Less Common - not marked as high risk in sub-tree but related to auth):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in session management to steal or manipulate user sessions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Less Common - not marked as high risk in sub-tree but related to auth):** Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher user privileges than intended.
*   **Consequences:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, including administrative accounts, leading to full site control, data manipulation, and other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Vulnerabilities (WordPress Specific) - SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_vulnerabilities__wordpress_specific__-_sql_injection__critical_node___high_risk_pat_36659aa5.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries to manipulate the database.
*   **How it Works:** Primarily occurs in plugins and themes that do not properly sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries. Attackers craft malicious inputs that, when processed, execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Consequences:** Data breach (access to sensitive database information), data manipulation, database compromise, potentially full server compromise in severe cases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities (WordPress Media Library/Plugins/Themes) - Unrestricted File Uploads [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_vulnerabilities__wordpress_media_librarypluginsthemes__-_unrestricted_file_uploa_9bd0cd01.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading malicious files, particularly executable files like PHP scripts, through WordPress upload functionalities.
*   **How it Works:** Occurs when WordPress or plugins/themes do not properly restrict file types allowed for upload or fail to validate and sanitize uploaded files. Attackers upload web shells or malware.
*   **Consequences:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the server, leading to full site compromise, server control, and further malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (WordPress Core, Plugins, Themes) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities__wordpress_core__plugins__themes___critical_node___high_r_3fb5b7f2.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the website that is executed in users' browsers.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are injected into the database (e.g., comments, posts) and executed when other users view the affected content.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** Malicious scripts are injected into URLs or form submissions and reflected back to the user in the response, executing in their browser.
*   **Consequences:** Account takeover (session cookie theft), website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, malware distribution to website visitors, information theft from users' browsers.
