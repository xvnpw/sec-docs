# Attack Surface Analysis for wordpress/wordpress

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within WordPress plugins due to coding errors, outdated code, or malicious intent.
*   **WordPress Contribution:** WordPress's extensive plugin ecosystem, a core feature for extending functionality, inherently introduces a large attack surface. WordPress itself provides the platform for plugins to be installed and executed.
*   **Example:** A popular e-commerce plugin has an unpatched SQL Injection vulnerability allowing attackers to extract customer data and potentially gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches (customer data, sensitive information), website defacement, malware distribution, complete website compromise, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Choose plugins carefully:** Select plugins from reputable developers with a history of security updates and positive reviews within the WordPress ecosystem.
    *   **Keep plugins updated:** Regularly update all installed plugins through the WordPress admin panel to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Remove unused plugins:** Delete plugins that are no longer needed via the WordPress plugin management interface to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Security scanning (WordPress specific):** Use WordPress security plugins or services designed to scan for plugin vulnerabilities within the WordPress environment.
    *   **Principle of least privilege:** Avoid granting plugins unnecessary permissions within the WordPress user and role management system.

## Attack Surface: [Theme Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/theme_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within WordPress themes, arising from coding errors, outdated code, or malicious intent.
*   **WordPress Contribution:** WordPress themes are integral to the platform's presentation and functionality. WordPress provides the theme system and allows users to install and activate themes, making theme vulnerabilities a direct WordPress attack surface.
*   **Example:** A theme contains a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting a flaw in the theme's template loading mechanism within WordPress.
*   **Impact:** Website defacement, malware injection, redirection to malicious sites, complete website compromise, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Choose themes carefully:** Select themes from reputable marketplaces or developers known within the WordPress community for security and quality.
    *   **Keep themes updated:** Regularly update themes through the WordPress theme management interface to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Avoid nulled or pirated themes (WordPress context):** These are often distributed through channels outside the official WordPress ecosystem and frequently contain malware or backdoors.
    *   **Security scanning (WordPress specific):** Use WordPress security plugins or services to scan for theme vulnerabilities within the WordPress environment.
    *   **Limit theme customization (security focused):**  Excessive theme modifications, especially directly editing theme files, can introduce vulnerabilities if not done with security best practices in mind within the WordPress development context.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities allowing users to upload files without proper validation, potentially leading to the upload of malicious files.
*   **WordPress Contribution:** WordPress's media library and certain plugin/theme functionalities within WordPress rely on file uploads. WordPress provides the core file upload mechanisms and APIs that plugins and themes utilize.
*   **Example:** A contact form plugin (within WordPress) allows file uploads without proper validation. An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image through the WordPress plugin's upload form, which can then be executed to gain remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), website defacement, malware hosting, data breaches, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Validate file types (WordPress context):** Use WordPress's built-in functions and hooks to restrict allowed file types to only necessary and safe formats during file uploads within WordPress.
    *   **Sanitize filenames (WordPress context):**  Use WordPress functions to sanitize filenames of uploaded files to prevent execution of malicious code through filename exploits within the WordPress environment.
    *   **Store uploads outside webroot (WordPress best practice):** While server configuration is involved, WordPress best practices recommend storing uploaded files outside the web-accessible directory to prevent direct execution, often achievable through WordPress configuration and server setup.
    *   **Disable script execution in uploads directory (server configuration, WordPress aware):** Configure the web server (often .htaccess or Nginx config, informed by WordPress directory structure) to prevent execution of scripts in the WordPress uploads directory.
    *   **Regular security audits (WordPress focused):** Review file upload functionalities in WordPress themes and plugins for vulnerabilities, specifically within the WordPress codebase and plugin/theme code.

## Attack Surface: [REST API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/rest_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in the WordPress REST API, allowing unauthorized access, data manipulation, or information disclosure through API endpoints.
*   **WordPress Contribution:** WordPress core includes a REST API as a fundamental feature. Vulnerabilities in the WordPress REST API are directly attributable to WordPress core code.
*   **Example:** An authentication bypass vulnerability in a WordPress REST API endpoint allows an attacker to access sensitive data or perform actions without proper authorization by exploiting a flaw in WordPress's API authentication mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to website functionalities, website defacement, denial of service, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the vulnerability and API endpoint's function, can be Critical for admin-level access).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable REST API if not needed (WordPress setting):** If the WordPress REST API is not required for your application, disable it through WordPress plugins or code snippets to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Restrict API access (WordPress and code level):** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for API endpoints, leveraging WordPress's API authentication features and custom code where necessary.
    *   **Regularly update WordPress core:** Keep WordPress core updated to patch known REST API vulnerabilities, as these are often addressed in WordPress core updates.
    *   **Security audits of custom API endpoints (WordPress development):** If you develop custom REST API endpoints within WordPress, ensure they are thoroughly security tested, following WordPress security best practices for API development.
    *   **Rate limiting (WordPress and server level):** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints, potentially using WordPress plugins or server-level configurations, to prevent denial of service attacks targeting the WordPress REST API.
