Here's the updated list of high and critical threats directly involving the Composer tool:

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Package Download
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the network communication between the developer's machine or the server and the package repository *during the download process initiated by Composer*. The attacker can then inject malicious code into the downloaded package before it reaches the intended recipient. This directly exploits the way Composer fetches packages.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious code, potentially compromising the development environment or the production server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Composer's Package Download process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all Composer operations by configuring `secure-http` to `true` in Composer configuration.
        *   Use a secure network connection when running Composer commands.

*   **Threat:** Resolution of Vulnerable Dependency Versions
    *   **Description:** *Composer's dependency resolution logic*, based on the version constraints defined in `composer.json`, might resolve to an older version of a dependency that contains known security vulnerabilities. This is a direct function of how Composer selects package versions.
    *   **Impact:**  The application becomes vulnerable to known exploits associated with the outdated dependency.
    *   **Affected Component:** Composer's Dependency Resolution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use specific and restrictive version constraints in `composer.json`.
        *   Regularly update dependencies using `composer update` and review the changes.
        *   Utilize tools like `composer audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Post-Install Scripts
    *   **Description:** A dependency includes malicious scripts that are executed automatically *by Composer* after the package is installed or updated. This directly leverages Composer's script execution feature.
    *   **Impact:**  Post-install scripts can be used to install backdoors, steal sensitive information, modify system configurations, or perform other malicious activities with the privileges of the user running Composer.
    *   **Affected Component:** Composer's Script Execution (post-install, post-update, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the scripts included in dependencies before installing them.
        *   Consider disabling post-install scripts globally or for specific packages if their functionality is not essential.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Local Composer Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a developer's local machine and modifies *the Composer installation or configuration*. This could involve altering the Composer executable itself or modifying configuration files to point to malicious repositories, directly impacting how Composer functions.
    *   **Impact:**  The developer's machine can be compromised, leading to the installation of malicious packages in their projects, potentially spreading to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Composer Executable, Composer Configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure developers' machines are secured with appropriate security measures.
        *   Regularly update Composer to the latest version.
        *   Restrict access to the Composer installation directory and configuration files.
