* **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities into the application through vulnerable dependencies (both direct and transitive).
    * **How Composer Contributes:** Composer is responsible for fetching and installing these dependencies as defined in `composer.json`. It directly introduces the risk of including vulnerable code.
    * **Example:** A project depends on a library for image processing. This library has a known remote code execution vulnerability. Composer installs this vulnerable library, making the application susceptible to this exploit.
    * **Impact:**  Can range from data breaches and remote code execution to denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update dependencies using `composer update`.
        * Utilize dependency vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `roave/security-advisories`, Snyk, Sonatype).
        * Pin specific dependency versions in `composer.json` to avoid unexpected updates with vulnerabilities, but ensure regular review and updates.
        * Monitor security advisories for used dependencies.
        * Consider using more secure alternatives if a dependency is known to have recurring vulnerabilities.

* **Compromised Package Repositories**
    * **Description:**  Malicious code injected into existing packages or new malicious packages uploaded to package repositories (like Packagist or private repositories).
    * **How Composer Contributes:** Composer trusts the configured package repositories and downloads packages from them. If a repository is compromised, Composer will fetch and install the malicious code.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to a Packagist account and injects a backdoor into a popular package. Developers using Composer to install or update this package will unknowingly include the malicious code in their applications.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to complete compromise of the application and the server it runs on, data theft, and supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use HTTPS for repository URLs in Composer configuration.
        * Be cautious about installing packages from unknown or untrusted sources.
        * Verify package integrity using signatures or checksums if available (though Composer's built-in verification helps).
        * Monitor package updates and be wary of unexpected changes or maintainer shifts.
        * For private repositories, implement strong access controls and security measures.

* **`composer.json` and `composer.lock` Manipulation**
    * **Description:** Attackers gaining access to and modifying the `composer.json` or `composer.lock` files to introduce malicious dependencies or specific vulnerable versions.
    * **How Composer Contributes:** Composer relies on these files to determine which packages to install. If these files are tampered with, Composer will install the attacker's chosen packages.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine or a version control system and modifies `composer.json` to include a malicious package with a similar name to a legitimate one. When `composer install` is run, the malicious package is installed.
    * **Impact:**  Introduction of malicious code, installation of vulnerable dependencies, potential for arbitrary code execution during installation scripts.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong access controls on development machines and version control systems.
        * Use code review processes for changes to `composer.json` and `composer.lock`.
        * Employ file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.
        * Store sensitive credentials used by Composer (e.g., for private repositories) securely.

* **Malicious Composer Scripts**
    * **Description:** Packages defining scripts (e.g., `post-install-cmd`, `post-update-cmd`) that execute malicious code during the Composer installation or update process.
    * **How Composer Contributes:** Composer executes these scripts automatically as part of its workflow.
    * **Example:** A seemingly benign package includes a `post-install-cmd` script that downloads and executes a backdoor on the developer's machine or the deployment server.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the system running Composer, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Review the scripts defined in the `composer.json` of dependencies before installation.
        * Disable scripts execution globally or for specific packages if not strictly necessary (using the `--no-scripts` flag).
        * Implement sandboxing or containerization for Composer execution, especially in CI/CD environments.

* **Vulnerabilities in Composer Plugins**
    * **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in installed Composer plugins.
    * **How Composer Contributes:** Composer's plugin system allows extending its functionality. Vulnerable plugins can introduce security flaws into the Composer process itself.
    * **Example:** A Composer plugin designed for code analysis has a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific input that triggers the flaw during Composer execution.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Composer process, potentially compromising the development environment or deployment process.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the severity of the plugin vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Composer plugins updated to the latest versions.
        * Only install plugins from trusted sources.
        * Review the code of plugins before installation if possible.
        * Monitor security advisories for installed Composer plugins.
