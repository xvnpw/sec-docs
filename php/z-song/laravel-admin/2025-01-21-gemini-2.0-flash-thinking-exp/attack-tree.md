## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Initial Access via Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/gain_initial_access_via_default_credentials.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Default Credentials [CRITICAL]
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Full admin access)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Low
    * Description: Attackers attempt to log in using commonly known default username and password combinations that might not have been changed after installation.
    * Mitigation: Enforce immediate change of default credentials during setup. Implement checks for default credentials and warn administrators.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Initial Access via Exploiting Known Authentication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/gain_initial_access_via_exploiting_known_authentication_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Laravel Admin Authentication
    * Likelihood: Medium (if using outdated versions)
    * Impact: High (Potentially full admin access)
    * Effort: Low (if exploit is publicly available) to Medium (if requires adaptation)
    * Skill Level: Beginner (using existing exploit) to Intermediate (adapting exploit)
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Description: Attackers leverage publicly known security flaws in specific versions of Laravel Admin to bypass authentication.
    * Mitigation: Regularly update Laravel Admin to the latest stable version. Monitor security advisories and apply patches promptly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Initial Access via Compromising an Existing Admin Account](./attack_tree_paths/gain_initial_access_via_compromising_an_existing_admin_account.md)

* Attack Vector: Phishing Attack Targeting Admin Credentials
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Full admin access)
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (difficult to detect on the application side)
    * Description: Attackers use deceptive emails or websites to trick administrators into revealing their login credentials.
    * Mitigation: Educate administrators about phishing techniques. Implement multi-factor authentication.
* Attack Vector: Malware Infection on Admin's Machine
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Full admin access)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (difficult to detect on the application side)
    * Description: Malware installed on an administrator's computer steals credentials or session tokens, allowing attackers to gain access.
    * Mitigation: Implement endpoint security measures (antivirus, anti-malware). Educate administrators about safe computing practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Code via Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_code_via_stored_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* Attack Vector: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium (Account takeover, information theft)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Description: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into data stored within Laravel Admin (e.g., in database fields managed through the admin panel). This script executes when other users view the data.
    * Mitigation: Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all data handled by Laravel Admin. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Code via File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_code_via_file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Upload Malicious Files (e.g., PHP shell) [CRITICAL]
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Remote code execution)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Description: Attackers upload malicious executable files (like PHP shells) through Laravel Admin's file upload functionality. If not properly validated and secured, these files can be accessed and executed, granting the attacker control over the server.
    * Mitigation: Implement strict file type validation (whitelist allowed extensions). Rename uploaded files. Store uploaded files outside the webroot. Disable direct execution of files in the upload directory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Laravel Admin](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_laravel_admin.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Packages
    * Likelihood: Medium (if dependencies are not regularly updated)
    * Impact: Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be high)
    * Effort: Low (if exploit is publicly available) to Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner (using existing exploit) to Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Description: Laravel Admin relies on other packages (including Laravel itself). Vulnerabilities in these underlying packages can be exploited if they are not kept up-to-date.
    * Mitigation: Regularly update all dependencies of Laravel Admin using Composer. Monitor security advisories for Laravel and its dependencies. Use tools like `composer audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.
