# Threat Model Analysis for z-song/laravel-admin

## Threat: [Default Credentials](./threats/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Laravel Admin panel using common default usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin, administrator/password) that might be present in initial configurations or if the administrator hasn't changed them. Upon successful login, the attacker gains full administrative privileges provided by Laravel Admin.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and its data accessible through the admin panel. The attacker can read, modify, or delete any information managed by Laravel Admin, create new administrative accounts within the admin interface, and potentially gain further access to the underlying system.
*   **Affected Component:** Laravel Admin's Authentication Middleware, potentially the User Model or authentication configuration specifically used by Laravel Admin.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Force password change upon the first login to the Laravel Admin panel.
    *   Enforce strong password policies specifically for Laravel Admin users.
    *   Remove or disable any default administrative accounts configured within Laravel Admin.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions within the Laravel Admin interface.

## Threat: [Insecure Mass Assignment via Admin Forms](./threats/insecure_mass_assignment_via_admin_forms.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data submitted through a Laravel Admin generated form. If Laravel Admin's form handling doesn't properly respect Eloquent model's `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties, the attacker can modify unintended database columns through the admin interface, potentially escalating privileges or manipulating sensitive data managed by Laravel Admin.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption within the data managed by Laravel Admin, unauthorized data modification through the admin interface, privilege escalation within the admin panel, and potential application instability related to admin functionalities.
*   **Affected Component:** Form rendering and submission handling within Laravel Admin's `Grid` and `Form` components. Interaction with Eloquent models within the admin context.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Laravel Admin's form handling respects and enforces `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties on all Eloquent models used in admin forms.
    *   Validate all user input submitted through Laravel Admin forms.
    *   Avoid directly using request data to update models within Laravel Admin controllers without proper filtering.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/unrestricted_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP web shell) through a file upload field provided by Laravel Admin. If Laravel Admin's file upload functionality doesn't properly validate file types, sanitize filenames, and store files securely, the attacker can access and execute the uploaded file, gaining control of the server hosting the Laravel Admin instance.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach of information managed by Laravel Admin, malware deployment affecting the server, and denial of service impacting the admin panel and potentially the entire application.
*   **Affected Component:** File upload functionality within Laravel Admin's `Form` component, potentially custom file upload handlers integrated with Laravel Admin.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation within Laravel Admin's file upload handling based on content, not just extension.
    *   Sanitize filenames within Laravel Admin's upload process to prevent directory traversal attacks.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web-accessible directory configured for the Laravel Admin application.
    *   Disable script execution in the upload directory used by Laravel Admin.
    *   Consider using a dedicated storage service integrated with Laravel Admin.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Custom Admin Logic within Laravel Admin](./threats/sql_injection_in_custom_admin_logic_within_laravel_admin.md)

*   **Description:** A developer writes custom SQL queries within Laravel Admin's controllers, form actions, or grid filters without proper sanitization of user-provided input handled by Laravel Admin components. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into these inputs via the admin interface, allowing them to bypass security checks, access sensitive data managed by Laravel Admin, modify database records related to admin functions, or even execute arbitrary database commands affecting the application's data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach of information managed through Laravel Admin, data manipulation within the admin context, unauthorized access to sensitive data via the admin panel, and potential denial of service affecting admin functionalities.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom controllers, form actions, or grid filters implemented by the developer within the Laravel Admin context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use Eloquent ORM or prepared statements with parameter binding for database interactions within Laravel Admin components.
    *   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user input handled by Laravel Admin.
    *   If raw queries are absolutely necessary within Laravel Admin, meticulously sanitize and validate all user input processed by the admin panel.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Laravel Admin Interface Elements](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_laravel_admin_interface_elements.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into data that is displayed within the Laravel Admin interface. This could occur through unsanitized user input in form fields, grid columns, or custom widgets provided by Laravel Admin. When another admin user views this data through the admin panel, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, performing actions on their behalf within the admin interface, or redirecting them to malicious sites.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking of admin accounts, account takeover within the admin panel, defacement of the Laravel Admin interface, and potential compromise of other admin users' accounts interacting with the admin panel.
*   **Affected Component:** View rendering within Laravel Admin's `Grid`, `Form`, and other UI components. Custom widgets or fields integrated with Laravel Admin.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize all user-generated content before displaying it within the Laravel Admin panel.
    *   Utilize Laravel's Blade templating engine's automatic escaping features within Laravel Admin views.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources within the context of the admin panel.
