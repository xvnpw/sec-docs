## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Brute-force default/common credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__brute-force_defaultcommon_credentials__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers use automated tools to try common usernames (like "admin") and default passwords (like "password" or "123456") or lists of weak passwords against the Laravel-Admin login page.
*   **Impact:** If successful, the attacker gains full administrative access to the Laravel-Admin panel and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Exploit weak password policies (if configurable and poorly set) (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__exploit_weak_password_policies__if_configurable_and_poorly_set___high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application allows configuration of password policies and they are set weakly (e.g., short minimum length, no complexity requirements), attackers can more easily crack or guess admin passwords.
*   **Impact:** Similar to brute-forcing default credentials, successful password cracking leads to full administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Inject SQL code through search forms and filters provided by Laravel-Admin (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__inject_sql_code_through_search_forms_and_filters_provided_by_laravel-admin__high-risk_path_st_a6aa4b3f.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into search forms or filters within the Laravel-Admin interface. If these inputs are not properly sanitized and used in raw SQL queries, the injected code is executed against the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), and potentially remote code execution depending on database permissions and application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2. Inject SQL code through data input fields in CRUD operations (Create, Update) (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2__inject_sql_code_through_data_input_fields_in_crud_operations__create__update___high-risk_path_e09d6e75.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to search forms, attackers inject SQL code into input fields used in Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations within Laravel-Admin. If these inputs are not properly handled by the application's data access layer (e.g., using raw queries instead of ORM), SQL injection can occur.
*   **Impact:** Same as 2.1.1: Data breach, data manipulation, and potential remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3. Exploit custom queries or raw SQL usage within Laravel-Admin extensions or customizations (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3__exploit_custom_queries_or_raw_sql_usage_within_laravel-admin_extensions_or_customizations__hi_32caac0d.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers extending or customizing Laravel-Admin might introduce vulnerabilities by writing custom SQL queries or using raw SQL without proper sanitization. Attackers can exploit these custom code paths.
*   **Impact:** Same as 2.1.1 and 2.1.2: Data breach, data manipulation, and potential remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Stored XSS through data input fields that are displayed in admin panels (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__stored_xss_through_data_input_fields_that_are_displayed_in_admin_panels__high-risk_path_start_57f01cd4.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into data input fields (e.g., in forms for creating or updating records) within Laravel-Admin. If this data is stored in the database and later displayed in the admin panel without proper output encoding, the JavaScript code will be executed in the browsers of admin users viewing that data.
*   **Impact:** Admin account compromise (session hijacking, cookie theft), performing actions on behalf of the admin, defacement of the admin panel, and potentially further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2. Reflected XSS through URL parameters or search queries in admin interface (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2__reflected_xss_through_url_parameters_or_search_queries_in_admin_interface__high-risk_path_sta_aa61342e.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript code in parameters or search queries. If the Laravel-Admin application reflects these parameters back to the user in the admin panel without proper output encoding, the JavaScript code will be executed when an admin user clicks on the malicious link.
*   **Impact:** Similar to stored XSS, but less persistent. Can still lead to admin account compromise and malicious actions during a single session.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.4.1. Upload malicious files (webshells, malware) through file upload functionalities (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2_4_1__upload_malicious_files__webshells__malware__through_file_upload_functionalities__high-risk_pa_da7b853e.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Laravel-Admin provides file upload features (e.g., for uploading images, documents, etc.), attackers attempt to upload malicious files, particularly webshells (scripts that allow remote command execution) or malware. If file type validation is weak or missing, and uploaded files are stored in accessible locations, the attacker can execute the webshell.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, full server compromise, data breach, and the ability to use the compromised server for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.4.2. Bypass file type restrictions to upload executable files (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/2_4_2__bypass_file_type_restrictions_to_upload_executable_files__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Even if file type validation is in place, attackers try to bypass it. This can involve techniques like using double extensions, null byte injection, or MIME type manipulation to trick the application into accepting executable files (e.g., PHP, JSP, ASPX) as allowed file types (e.g., images).
*   **Impact:** Same as 2.4.1: Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Leverage debug information to gain insights into application structure and vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH - Enabler)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__leverage_debug_information_to_gain_insights_into_application_structure_and_vulnerabilities__h_9506d620.md)

**Attack Vector:** If debug mode is enabled in production, error messages, stack traces, and configuration details are exposed. Attackers analyze this information to understand the application's architecture, identify potential vulnerabilities, database connection strings, and other sensitive details that aid in further attacks (like SQL injection or authentication bypass).
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure that significantly lowers the effort and skill required for other attacks, increasing the likelihood of successful compromise through other paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific Laravel version used by Laravel-Admin (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_the_specific_laravel_version_used_by_laravel-admin__high-ris_c4ff97b5.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify the specific version of Laravel framework used by the Laravel-Admin application (often revealed in headers or error pages, especially with debug mode on). They then search for known security vulnerabilities in that Laravel version and attempt to exploit them.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the specific Laravel vulnerability. Could range from remote code execution to data breaches or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1. Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in any third-party packages that Laravel-Admin depends on (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1__identify_and_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_any_third-party_packages_that_laravel-admin_depends_o_484925f2.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers analyze Laravel-Admin's dependencies (listed in `composer.json` or `composer.lock`). They then search for known vulnerabilities in these third-party packages and attempt to exploit them.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerable package and the specific vulnerability. Could range from remote code execution to data breaches or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1.1. Send phishing emails disguised as legitimate Laravel-Admin login requests (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_1__send_phishing_emails_disguised_as_legitimate_laravel-admin_login_requests__high-risk_path_sta_11e6a941.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers send phishing emails to admin users, disguised as legitimate notifications or requests related to Laravel-Admin login (e.g., password reset requests, urgent login alerts). These emails contain links to fake login pages that mimic the real Laravel-Admin login page. When users enter their credentials on the fake page, the attacker captures them.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of admin credentials, leading to full administrative access to the Laravel-Admin panel and the application.
