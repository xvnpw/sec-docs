# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `laravel-admin`, aims to provide a rapid development tool for building administration interfaces for Laravel applications. The primary business goal is to accelerate the development of back-office systems, content management systems (CMS), and customer relationship management (CRM) applications built with Laravel. This speed of development translates to reduced development costs and faster time-to-market for applications requiring administrative interfaces.

Key business priorities are:
- Rapid application development:  `laravel-admin` should significantly reduce the time and effort required to build admin panels.
- Ease of use: The tool should be intuitive and easy for developers to learn and use.
- Customization and extensibility: While providing rapid scaffolding, it should also allow for customization to meet specific project needs.
- Stability and reliability: The generated admin panels should be stable and reliable in production environments.

Most important business risks to address:
- Security vulnerabilities in generated admin panels: If `laravel-admin` introduces security flaws, it could compromise the applications that use it. This is a critical risk as admin panels often handle sensitive data and critical operations.
- Compatibility issues with different Laravel versions or other packages:  Lack of compatibility can hinder adoption and increase development effort.
- Maintainability and long-term support:  If the project is not actively maintained, it could become a liability for projects relying on it.
- Vendor lock-in: Over-reliance on `laravel-admin` might create vendor lock-in, making it difficult to migrate to other solutions in the future.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Laravel framework's built-in security features are likely leveraged, such as protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Implemented within the Laravel framework itself.
- security control: Input validation and sanitization are expected to be implemented within the generated admin panels, likely using Laravel's validation mechanisms. Implemented within the `laravel-admin` generated code and Laravel framework.
- security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms are provided by `laravel-admin`, likely based on Laravel's authentication and authorization features. Implemented within `laravel-admin` package.
- security control: Password hashing is expected to be used for storing user credentials, leveraging Laravel's hashing facilities. Implemented within `laravel-admin` package and Laravel framework.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by `laravel-admin`. Risk is partially mitigated by Laravel's ecosystem and community scrutiny, but requires ongoing dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of generated admin panels by developers. Developers need to be educated on secure configuration practices.
- accepted risk:  Security vulnerabilities introduced through customizations and extensions by developers. Developers are responsible for the security of their custom code.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the development pipeline for `laravel-admin` itself and for projects that use it.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of `laravel-admin` and example applications built with it.
- security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using `laravel-admin`.
- security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning and automated updates for `laravel-admin` and generated projects.
- security control: Encourage and facilitate community security contributions and vulnerability reporting.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Secure user authentication to the admin panel, supporting strong password policies and potentially multi-factor authentication.
    - security requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to different parts of the admin panel.
    - security requirement: Session management to securely handle user sessions and prevent session hijacking.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access to specific data and actions based on user roles and permissions.
    - security requirement: Ensure proper authorization checks are performed before granting access to any sensitive data or functionality.
- Input validation:
    - security requirement: Robust input validation and sanitization for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    - security requirement: Input validation should be applied both on the client-side and server-side.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Use strong encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit. Leverage HTTPS for all communication.
    - security requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys.
    - security requirement: Use password hashing with strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) and salts.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes and pushes them to a Version Control System (e.g., GitHub).
2. A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered upon code push.
3. The CI/CD pipeline performs the following steps:
    - Source Code Checkout: Retrieves the latest code from the repository.
    - Dependency Resolution: Resolves and downloads project dependencies (e.g., PHP packages using Composer).
    - Build Application: Compiles or builds the application if necessary (for PHP projects, this might involve tasks like asset compilation).
    - Unit & Integration Tests: Executes automated unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Security Scans: Performs security scans, including:
        - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
        - Dependency vulnerability checks to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    - Build Artifacts: Creates build artifacts, such as Docker images or deployable PHP packages.
4. Build Artifacts are pushed to an Artifact Repository (e.g., Docker Registry, Package Registry).
5. The artifacts from the repository are then deployed to the target Deployment Environment.

- security control: Code Signing (optional): Signing build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Management of application data: The admin panel is used to create, read, update, and delete critical application data. Data integrity and availability are crucial.
- User management and access control: The admin panel manages user accounts and permissions, which are essential for securing the application and its data.
- System configuration and monitoring:  Admin panels often provide access to system configuration and monitoring tools, which are critical for maintaining system stability and security.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Application data: This is highly sensitive as it represents the core business information. Sensitivity depends on the specific application but can include personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or confidential business information.
- User credentials: Passwords and other authentication factors for admin panel users are highly sensitive and must be protected to prevent unauthorized access.
- System configuration data: Configuration settings for the application and infrastructure can be sensitive and should be protected from unauthorized modification.
- Audit logs: Logs containing information about user actions and system events can be sensitive and valuable for security monitoring and incident response.
