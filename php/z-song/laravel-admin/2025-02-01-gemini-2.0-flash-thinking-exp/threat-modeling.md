# Threat Model Analysis for z-song/laravel-admin

## Threat: [Default Admin Credentials](./threats/default_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to access the admin panel using default or common credentials. If default credentials are not changed after installation of Laravel-admin, attackers gain immediate administrative access.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and underlying server. Attackers can modify data, create backdoors, escalate privileges, and potentially pivot to other systems due to complete control over the admin interface.
    *   **Affected Laravel-admin Component:**  Admin Login Functionality, User Management (initial setup).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change default admin credentials during initial setup of Laravel-admin.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all admin users created within Laravel-admin.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts to the Laravel-admin panel.

## Threat: [Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Enforcement within Laravel-admin](./threats/insufficient_role-based_access_control__rbac__enforcement_within_laravel-admin.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers with low-privileged admin accounts exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Laravel-admin's RBAC system. They may bypass intended permission restrictions to access features, data, or actions meant for higher-privileged roles within the admin panel itself. This could be due to flaws in Laravel-admin's permission checks or incorrect implementation by developers using the package.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed through Laravel-admin, modification of critical configurations within the admin panel, privilege escalation within the admin interface, and potential disruption of application functionality controlled by the admin panel.
    *   **Affected Laravel-admin Component:** Permission System, Menu System, Form and Grid Builders, Controllers provided by Laravel-admin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and customize Laravel-admin's permission system to strictly align with application-specific roles and responsibilities.
        *   Implement granular permissions for each admin feature and resource exposed through Laravel-admin.
        *   Regularly audit and test RBAC implementation within Laravel-admin to ensure proper enforcement and prevent bypasses.
        *   Utilize Laravel's authorization features in conjunction with Laravel-admin's permission system for a more robust and layered access control approach.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Panel Views Rendered by Laravel-admin](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_panel_views_rendered_by_laravel-admin.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields or data that is subsequently displayed within the Laravel-admin interface. If Laravel-admin does not properly sanitize or escape user inputs when rendering views, this malicious script can execute in the browsers of other admin users viewing those pages.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover of admin users through session cookie theft or malicious actions performed on their behalf, data theft from the admin panel interface, defacement of the admin panel, and potential propagation of attacks to other admin users interacting with the compromised views.
    *   **Affected Laravel-admin Component:** Form Fields, Grid Columns, Detail Views, and any other components within Laravel-admin that render user-supplied or database-driven data without proper output encoding.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that Laravel-admin's Blade templates and components are correctly utilizing Laravel's automatic escaping features to prevent XSS.
        *   Implement explicit output encoding for all user-controlled data displayed in admin views, especially when rendering raw HTML or data from external sources within Laravel-admin.
        *   Conduct regular XSS vulnerability scanning and penetration testing specifically targeting the Laravel-admin panel and its rendered views.
        *   Educate developers on secure coding practices regarding XSS prevention within the context of Laravel-admin development and customization.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Laravel-admin URLs and Forms](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_laravel-admin_urls_and_forms.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate object IDs in URLs or form parameters within the Laravel-admin panel to access or modify resources they are not authorized to manage. This exploits potential weaknesses in how Laravel-admin handles resource identification and authorization based on these IDs. For example, changing a user ID in an edit URL to access another user's profile through Laravel-admin's interface.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by Laravel-admin, modification or deletion of data belonging to other users or entities through the admin panel, and potential data breaches due to unauthorized data manipulation via the admin interface.
    *   **Affected Laravel-admin Component:**  Routing within Laravel-admin, Controllers provided by Laravel-admin, Form and Grid Builders that generate URLs and handle form submissions based on object IDs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly exposing internal, sequential object IDs in URLs generated by Laravel-admin where possible. Consider using UUIDs or other non-predictable identifiers.
        *   Implement robust server-side authorization checks within Laravel-admin controllers to verify that the logged-in admin user has explicit permission to access and manipulate the requested resource based on the object ID before performing any actions.
        *   Ensure that Laravel-admin's form handling and data retrieval mechanisms properly enforce authorization based on the current user's roles and permissions, not just the presence of a valid object ID.

## Threat: [File Upload Vulnerabilities in Laravel-admin Features](./threats/file_upload_vulnerabilities_in_laravel-admin_features.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) through file upload features provided by Laravel-admin. If Laravel-admin's file upload functionality lacks proper validation and handling, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, compromise the server hosting the Laravel-admin panel, or use it as a staging point for further attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise originating from the Laravel-admin interface, data breaches affecting data managed through the admin panel, malware distribution via the server, denial of service attacks, and significant reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Laravel-admin Component:** Form Fields of 'file' type within Laravel-admin, Media Manager if integrated with Laravel-admin, and any other features within Laravel-admin that allow file uploads.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation and whitelisting within Laravel-admin's file upload handling, based on both file extensions and MIME types.
        *   Sanitize filenames uploaded through Laravel-admin to prevent directory traversal and other filename-based attacks.
        *   Store files uploaded via Laravel-admin outside of the web root or in a protected directory with restricted execution permissions to limit the impact of successful uploads.
        *   Implement file size limits within Laravel-admin's file upload configurations to prevent denial-of-service attacks through large file uploads.
        *   Consider integrating a dedicated file storage service with built-in security features for handling uploads from Laravel-admin.
        *   Implement malware scanning for files uploaded through Laravel-admin, especially if handling sensitive data or allowing uploads from less trusted admin users.
