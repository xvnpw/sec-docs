# Threat Model Analysis for z-song/laravel-admin

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Extension Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_extension_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:**  Privilege Escalation via Extension Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party or custom `laravel-admin` extension.  The attacker might upload a malicious extension, or exploit a vulnerability in an existing extension (e.g., a file upload vulnerability, an insecure direct object reference, or a code injection flaw) to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server user.  This could allow them to bypass `laravel-admin`'s RBAC and gain full administrative access.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.  The attacker could read, modify, or delete any data, install malware, or use the server for other malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `laravel-admin` Extensions (specifically, vulnerable third-party or custom extensions).  This could affect any extension that handles user input, file uploads, or interacts with the database or filesystem. The `Admin::extend()` function and the extension loading mechanism are potential attack vectors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Vetting:**  Thoroughly vet all third-party extensions before installation.  Examine the code for potential vulnerabilities, check the developer's reputation, and review user feedback.
        *   **Updates:**  Keep all extensions updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the web server with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running as root.
        *   **Code Review:**  Perform code reviews of all custom extensions, paying close attention to security best practices.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation and output encoding in all custom extensions.
        *   **File Upload Restrictions:**  If file uploads are allowed, restrict file types, sizes, and upload locations.  Scan uploaded files for malware.
        *   **Security Audits:**  Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing, focusing on extensions.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication to Laravel-Admin](./threats/weak_authentication_to_laravel-admin.md)

* **Threat:** Weak Authentication to Laravel-Admin

    * **Description:** An attacker uses brute-force, credential stuffing, or password guessing attacks to gain access to a `laravel-admin` user account. This is due to weak password policies, lack of multi-factor authentication, or the use of default credentials. This directly impacts `laravel-admin` because it manages its own authentication system.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the `laravel-admin` interface, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
    * **Affected Component:** `laravel-admin` Authentication (specifically, the login form, user model, and authentication logic). The `config/admin.php` auth settings are relevant.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies, requiring a minimum length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and regular password changes.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all `laravel-admin` users.
        *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   **No Default Credentials:** Change default `laravel-admin` credentials immediately after installation.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Login):** Implement rate limiting on the login route to prevent rapid login attempts.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via `config/admin.php` or Extension Configs (Direct File Access *if* Web Server Misconfigured)](./threats/configuration_tampering_via__configadmin_php__or_extension_configs__direct_file_access_if_web_server_cc965930.md)

*   **Threat:**  Configuration Tampering via `config/admin.php` or Extension Configs (Direct File Access *if* Web Server Misconfigured)

    *   **Description:**  While *ideally* file system access is a server-level concern, if the web server is misconfigured to allow direct access to files within the `vendor/encore/laravel-admin` or `config/` directory, an attacker could directly modify `laravel-admin`'s core configuration or extension configurations.  This is a *direct* threat to `laravel-admin` *if* the underlying server security is insufficient.  The attacker could change authentication settings, disable security features, or inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypass of authentication, gain of administrative access, exposure of sensitive information, or disruption of application functionality. The severity depends on the specific configuration changes.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `laravel-admin` Configuration Files (specifically, `config/admin.php` and any configuration files related to installed extensions). The `Admin::config()` function and how configuration is loaded are relevant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (conditional on server misconfiguration, but *directly* impacts `laravel-admin`)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Web Server Configuration:**  **Crucially**, ensure the web server (Apache, Nginx) is configured to *prevent direct access* to the `vendor/` and `config/` directories.  This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **File System Permissions:**  Implement strict file system permissions.  The web server user should have minimal write access to configuration files.
        *   **Version Control:**  Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to configuration files.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:**  Use a file integrity monitoring (FIM) system to detect unauthorized changes.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive configuration values (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in environment variables, not directly in configuration files.
