## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-force Admin Login Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_admin_login_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to guess the administrator's username and password by trying a large number of combinations. This can be done manually or using automated tools that iterate through lists of common passwords and usernames.

**Success Condition:** The attacker successfully guesses the correct credentials or the application lacks adequate protection against brute-force attacks (e.g., account lockout policies, rate limiting).

**Impact:** If successful, the attacker gains full administrative access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Hijacking/Fixation -> Through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/session_hijackingfixation_-_through_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:**

*   First, the attacker exploits a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Laravel Admin interface. This involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the application that will be executed in the browser of an authenticated administrator.
*   Once the malicious script is executed in the administrator's browser, it can access the administrator's session cookie.
*   The attacker then retrieves this session cookie (e.g., by sending it to an attacker-controlled server).
*   Finally, the attacker uses the stolen session cookie to impersonate the administrator and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Success Condition:** The application contains exploitable XSS vulnerabilities, and the attacker successfully injects and executes malicious code in an administrator's session.

**Impact:** If successful, the attacker gains full administrative access to the application by hijacking the administrator's active session.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored XSS](./attack_tree_paths/stored_xss.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a data store (e.g., the database) through an input field within the Laravel Admin interface. This malicious script is then persistently stored. When another administrator (or potentially other users) views the data containing the malicious script, the script is executed in their browser.

**Success Condition:** The application does not properly sanitize user input before storing it in the database, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact:**  The malicious script can perform various actions in the context of the victim's browser, including stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the administrator, or redirecting them to malicious websites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use XSS to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the admin](./attack_tree_paths/use_xss_to_steal_session_cookies_or_perform_actions_on_behalf_of_the_admin.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to the previous XSS attack vector, but focuses specifically on the immediate goal of compromising the administrator's session or performing actions without directly stealing the cookie. This could involve using JavaScript to make API calls on behalf of the administrator.

**Success Condition:** The application contains exploitable XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** The attacker can gain control of the administrator's session, allowing them to perform any action the administrator is authorized to do, or directly execute administrative actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in Laravel Admin](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses_in_laravel_admin.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This encompasses various vulnerabilities related to how the application verifies user identity and manages access permissions. This could include:

*   Exploiting flaws in the login process to bypass authentication.
*   Manipulating user roles or permissions to gain unauthorized access.
*   Exploiting vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication (if implemented).

**Success Condition:** A weakness exists in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of Laravel Admin.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can grant the attacker full or partial administrative access, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default or Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_or_weak_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker attempts to log in using default credentials that were not changed after installation or uses easily guessable passwords.

**Success Condition:** The administrator has not changed the default credentials or is using a weak password.

**Impact:** The attacker gains full administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (SQLi)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__sqli_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them into input fields within the Laravel Admin interface. If the application does not properly sanitize user input, these malicious queries are executed against the database.

**Success Condition:** The application's database queries are vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of input sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   Data breach: Accessing sensitive data stored in the database.
*   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
*   Remote code execution: In some cases, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Attack Vectors:** As described in the High-Risk Paths, XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application that are executed in the browsers of other users (typically administrators in this context).

**Success Condition:** The application does not properly sanitize user input before displaying it or storing it.

**Impact:**  XSS can be used for various malicious purposes, including:

*   Session hijacking (as detailed above).
*   Defacing the admin interface.
*   Redirecting administrators to malicious websites.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the administrator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_uploads.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a web shell) through a file upload functionality in the Laravel Admin interface. If the application does not properly validate the file type, content, and name, the malicious file can be uploaded to the server's file system.

**Success Condition:** The application lacks proper file validation and allows the upload of executable files.

**Impact:** Successful upload of a web shell allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies known security vulnerabilities in the versions of Laravel, Laravel Admin, or other third-party packages used by the application. They then use publicly available exploits to target these vulnerabilities.

**Success Condition:** The application uses outdated versions of its dependencies that contain known security flaws.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it can range from information disclosure to remote code execution and full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Issues in Laravel Admin](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_issues_in_laravel_admin.md)

**Attack Vectors:** This involves exploiting insecure configurations within the Laravel Admin setup. This could include:

*   Accessing sensitive configuration files (e.g., `.env`) containing database credentials or API keys.
*   Exploiting misconfigured security settings, such as having debug mode enabled in production.
*   Leveraging insecure default settings that were not changed after installation.

**Success Condition:** The application has insecure configurations that expose sensitive information or create vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific misconfiguration, but it can lead to information disclosure, credential theft, and pathways for further exploitation.
