# Threat Model Analysis for z-song/laravel-admin

## Threat: [Default Credentials Exploitation](./threats/default_credentials_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the `laravel-admin` panel using default or easily guessable credentials that were not changed during the initial setup. They might use common username/password combinations or consult default credential lists.
*   **Impact:**  Successful login grants the attacker full administrative access to the application, allowing them to view, modify, or delete data, create new administrative users, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Force a strong password change during the initial setup of `laravel-admin`.
    *   Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials.
    *   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for the admin panel.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Exploitation via Admin Forms](./threats/mass_assignment_exploitation_via_admin_forms.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious requests to the `laravel-admin` generated forms, including unexpected or protected model attributes. If the Eloquent models used by `laravel-admin` are not properly guarded, the attacker can modify these attributes, potentially escalating privileges or manipulating sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification of data, including user roles, permissions, or other critical application settings. This could lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, or application malfunction.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always explicitly define `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties in Eloquent models used with `laravel-admin`.
    *   Carefully review the forms generated by `laravel-admin` and ensure appropriate input validation is in place.
    *   Consider using Form Requests for more robust validation and authorization of form submissions.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Panel Views](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_panel_views.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into fields or data displayed within the `laravel-admin` interface. When an administrator views this data, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, performing actions on their behalf, or redirecting them to malicious sites.
*   **Impact:**  Account takeover of administrators, leading to full control of the application. Potential for further attacks targeting other administrators or even application users if the admin panel is used to manage user-facing content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and escape user-supplied data before displaying it in `laravel-admin` views using Blade's escaping features (e.g., `{{ }}`).
    *   Be particularly careful with fields that allow rich text input; implement robust sanitization libraries.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Inadequate Authorization leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/inadequate_authorization_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:**  The role-based access control (RBAC) system provided by `laravel-admin` is not configured correctly, allowing users with lower privileges to access functionalities or data intended for higher-level administrators. An attacker could exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**  Users gaining access to sensitive data or administrative functions they should not have, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or disruption of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly plan and implement the RBAC system provided by `laravel-admin`.
    *   Regularly review and audit the configured roles and permissions to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
    *   Use granular permissions and avoid assigning overly broad roles.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/unrestricted_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** The file upload functionality provided by `laravel-admin` is not properly secured, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files, including executable scripts (e.g., PHP web shells). If these uploaded files are accessible via the web, the attacker can execute them, gaining control of the server.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not just the file extension.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct access.
    *   Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable names.
    *   Implement file size limits.
    *   Consider using a dedicated storage service and scanning uploaded files for malware.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in File Management Features](./threats/path_traversal_in_file_management_features.md)

*   **Description:** If `laravel-admin` provides file management capabilities, vulnerabilities could exist that allow an attacker to manipulate file paths to access or modify files outside of the intended directories. This could allow them to access sensitive configuration files or overwrite critical system files.
*   **Impact:**  Access to sensitive files, potential modification of application configuration, or even system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs related to file paths.
    *   Use absolute paths or restrict file access to specific directories.
    *   Avoid allowing users to directly manipulate file paths.
