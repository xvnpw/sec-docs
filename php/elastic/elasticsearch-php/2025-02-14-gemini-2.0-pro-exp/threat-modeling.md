# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-php

## Threat: [Rogue Elasticsearch Server Impersonation](./threats/rogue_elasticsearch_server_impersonation.md)

*   **Threat:** Rogue Elasticsearch Server Impersonation

    *   **Description:** An attacker sets up a fake Elasticsearch server and tricks the `elasticsearch-php` client into connecting to it. This relies on the client *not* properly verifying the server's identity.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage (attacker receives sensitive data), data manipulation (attacker injects false data), denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Connection handling within `Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder` and transport layers (e.g., `Http\Curl`, `Http\Stream`), specifically the `hosts` configuration and SSL/TLS verification logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strict HTTPS:** Always use `https` in the `hosts` configuration.
        *   **Enable SSL Verification:**  Set `sslVerification` to `true` in the `ClientBuilder`. Provide a CA bundle path if needed.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the `elasticsearch-php` client and the Elasticsearch server, modifying requests or responses. This is only possible if the client is *not* using encrypted communication.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Communication layer; transport implementation (e.g., `Http\Curl`, `Http\Stream`) and handling of HTTP requests/responses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for all communication. Configure `https` in the `hosts` setting.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure (through client misconfiguration)](./threats/credential_exposure__through_client_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Exposure (through client misconfiguration)

    *   **Description:** While credentials themselves aren't *part* of the client library, *misconfiguration* of the client (e.g., hardcoding credentials within a script that uses the client, or accidentally logging the client object which might contain credentials) can lead to exposure. This is a direct threat *because* the client handles credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster; potential for complete cluster compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder` (where credentials are provided), and any application code that instantiates or logs the client object.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Never hardcode credentials. Use environment variables, a secrets management system, or a secure configuration service.
        *   **Avoid Logging Client Object:** Do not log the entire `Elasticsearch\Client` object, as it may contain the credentials in its internal state.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** The `elasticsearch-php` client itself, or one of its dependencies (e.g., Guzzle), has a known security vulnerability that allows for remote code execution or other severe impacts.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution, potentially compromising the entire application server.
    * **Affected Component:** The `elasticsearch-php` library itself and its dependencies, as listed in `composer.json`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability, but assume critical until assessed)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update the `elasticsearch-php` client and its dependencies to the latest versions using Composer (`composer update`).
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for `elasticsearch-php` and its dependencies (especially Guzzle, if used).
