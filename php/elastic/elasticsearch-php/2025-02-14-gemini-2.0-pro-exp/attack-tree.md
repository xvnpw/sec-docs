## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Deserialization Issues)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__deserialization_issues_.md)

Overall Description: This attack vector focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities related to the deserialization of data received from the Elasticsearch cluster. If the application using `elasticsearch-php` deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, it can lead to severe consequences, including Remote Code Execution (RCE).

Critical Node: Deserialization Issues:
    Description:  The root problem is the unsafe handling of serialized data.  This is a *class* of vulnerabilities, not a single specific flaw.
    Likelihood: Medium
    Impact: Very High
    Effort: Medium
    Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    Detection Difficulty: Medium

Critical Node: Untrusted Data in Serialized Objects:
    Description:  The application receives data from Elasticsearch (e.g., in a response to a query) and uses PHP's native `serialize`/`unserialize` functions (or a vulnerable alternative) to deserialize this data *without* first validating its contents or structure. An attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, triggers unintended code execution.
    Likelihood: Medium
    Impact: Very High
    Effort: Medium
    Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    Detection Difficulty: Medium

Critical Node: RCE via PHP Object Injection:
    Description: This is the *consequence* of successfully exploiting the `Untrusted Data in Serialized Objects` vulnerability.  By injecting a carefully crafted serialized object, the attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the *application server*. This gives the attacker full control over the server running the PHP application.
    Likelihood: Medium (Dependent on successful deserialization exploit)
    Impact: Very High
    Effort: Medium
    Skill Level: Advanced
    Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Client Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_client_configuration.md)

Overall Description: This attack vector targets the configuration of the `elasticsearch-php` client itself.  Insecure configurations can create opportunities for attackers to intercept data, redirect connections, or gain access to sensitive information.

Critical Node: Missing Hostname Verification:
    Description: The `elasticsearch-php` client is configured to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster without verifying the server's hostname against the certificate presented during the TLS/SSL handshake. This allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. The attacker can intercept the connection, present a fake certificate, and eavesdrop on or modify the communication between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster.
    Likelihood: Low to Medium
    Impact: High
    Effort: Medium
    Skill Level: Intermediate
    Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

Critical Node: Exposure of Sensitive Config:
    Description: The application inadvertently exposes the configuration settings of the `elasticsearch-php` client. This could happen through error messages, debug logs, insecure storage (e.g., hardcoded credentials in the source code, configuration files exposed to the web), or other information disclosure vulnerabilities.  Exposed configuration can include Elasticsearch cluster addresses, usernames, passwords, API keys, and other sensitive details.
    Likelihood: Low to Medium
    Impact: High
    Effort: Very Low
    Skill Level: Novice
    Detection Difficulty: Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Legitimate Client Features (Search Query Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_legitimate_client_features__search_query_injection_.md)

Overall Description: This attack vector exploits the intended functionality of the `elasticsearch-php` client – sending queries to Elasticsearch – but uses it maliciously.  If the application doesn't properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into Elasticsearch queries, an attacker can inject malicious code or manipulate the query to achieve unintended results.

Critical Node: Search Query Injection:
   Description: The root problem is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization/escaping of user-provided data that is used to construct Elasticsearch queries.
    Likelihood: Medium
    Impact: Very High
    Effort: Medium
    Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

Critical Node: Script Injection (e.g., Painless):
    Description: The application allows user input to directly influence Elasticsearch queries, and this input is *not* properly sanitized or escaped. An attacker can inject malicious scripts (using Elasticsearch's scripting languages, such as Painless) into the query.  These scripts are then executed *on the Elasticsearch cluster*, potentially giving the attacker Remote Code Execution (RCE) capabilities on the cluster itself.
    Likelihood: Medium
    Impact: Very High
    Effort: Medium
    Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
    Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard
