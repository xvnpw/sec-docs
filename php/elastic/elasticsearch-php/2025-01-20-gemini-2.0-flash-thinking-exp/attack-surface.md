# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-php

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code or commands into Elasticsearch queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even remote code execution on the Elasticsearch server.

**How Elasticsearch-PHP Contributes:** The library allows developers to construct queries programmatically. If user input is directly embedded into these queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates an injection vulnerability.

**Example:** A search functionality where the search term is taken directly from a URL parameter (`$_GET['search']`) and used in a query like: `$client->search(['body' => ['query' => ['match' => ['field' => $_GET['search']]]]]);`. An attacker could craft a malicious search term like `"}}}},"script":{"source":"System.setProperty(\"foo\",\"bar\")","lang":"painless"}}}` to execute arbitrary code (if scripting is enabled on the Elasticsearch server).

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use Parameterized Queries:** Utilize the query builder provided by `elasticsearch-php` or manually construct queries with placeholders for user input, which are then properly escaped by the library.
*   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into Elasticsearch queries. Use whitelisting and escaping techniques.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Elasticsearch Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_elasticsearch_credentials.md)

**Description:** Sensitive credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) used to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster are exposed, allowing unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch data.

**How Elasticsearch-PHP Contributes:** The library requires configuration with connection details, including credentials. If these are hardcoded in the application code or stored insecurely, they become a target.

**Example:**  Storing Elasticsearch credentials directly in a PHP configuration file that is accessible via a web vulnerability or is committed to a public repository. `$client = ClientBuilder::create()->setHosts(['http://user:password@localhost:9200'])->build();`

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use Environment Variables:** Store credentials in environment variables that are managed securely by the hosting environment or orchestration tools.
*   **Secrets Management Systems:** Utilize dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve credentials securely.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Transport Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_transport_configuration.md)

**Description:** Communication between the PHP application and the Elasticsearch cluster is not properly secured, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.

**How Elasticsearch-PHP Contributes:** The library allows configuration of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and SSL/TLS verification settings. Incorrect configuration can lead to insecure communication.

**Example:** Disabling SSL verification when connecting to Elasticsearch over HTTPS: `$client = ClientBuilder::create()->setHosts(['https://localhost:9200'])->setSSLVerification(false)->build();`. This makes the connection susceptible to interception.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enforce HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for communication with the Elasticsearch cluster.
*   **Enable SSL/TLS Verification:** Ensure that SSL/TLS certificate verification is enabled in the `elasticsearch-php` client configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Bulk API Misuse](./attack_surfaces/bulk_api_misuse.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate bulk API requests to insert, update, or delete large amounts of data in Elasticsearch in an unauthorized or malicious way.

**How Elasticsearch-PHP Contributes:** The library provides methods for performing bulk operations. If the application allows user-controlled input to influence the data or actions within bulk requests without proper validation and authorization, it creates a vulnerability.

**Example:** An application allows users to upload data that is then indexed into Elasticsearch using the Bulk API. If the application doesn't validate the uploaded data, an attacker could inject malicious data or commands into the bulk request.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all data that will be included in bulk API requests.
*   **Authorization Checks:** Implement proper authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can perform bulk operations and modify specific data.
