## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Elasticsearch-PHP [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_elasticsearch-php__critical_node_.md)

- This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Elasticsearch Requests [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_elasticsearch_requests__critical_node_.md)

- This represents the attacker's ability to influence the requests sent from the application to Elasticsearch. It's critical because controlling these requests allows for various malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_injection__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

- Attackers inject malicious code or modify existing parameters within the Elasticsearch query string.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Query Parameters [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_query_parameters__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Search Criteria to Expose Sensitive Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_search_criteria_to_expose_sensitive_data__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers alter search terms or filters to retrieve data they are not authorized to access. This has a high likelihood if input is not sanitized and a high impact due to potential data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Body Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/body_injection__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

- Attackers manipulate the JSON body of the Elasticsearch request.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JSON Body [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_json_body__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Data within Elasticsearch Indices [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_data_within_elasticsearch_indices__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers alter the request body to change existing data in Elasticsearch. This has a medium likelihood and high impact (data tampering).

## Attack Tree Path: [Delete Data within Elasticsearch Indices [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/delete_data_within_elasticsearch_indices__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers modify the request body to delete data from Elasticsearch. This has a medium likelihood and high impact (data loss, denial of service).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_library_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

- Attackers leverage known weaknesses or bugs within the `elasticsearch-php` library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Known Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/known_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__cves___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers use publicly known exploits for vulnerabilities in the library. This has a low to medium likelihood (depending on patching) and critical impact if it leads to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution on Application Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution_on_application_server__critical_node_.md)

Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the application server, leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Configuration/Usage [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_configurationusage__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

- Attackers exploit misconfigurations or insecure practices in how the application uses the `elasticsearch-php` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Elasticsearch Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_elasticsearch_credentials__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Elasticsearch Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_elasticsearch_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers gain access to the credentials used by the application to connect to Elasticsearch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Elasticsearch Directly [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/access_elasticsearch_directly__high-risk_path_.md)

With the credentials, attackers can directly access and manipulate Elasticsearch data outside the application's intended scope.

## Attack Tree Path: [Impersonate Application to Elasticsearch [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/impersonate_application_to_elasticsearch__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers use the credentials to send malicious requests to Elasticsearch, appearing as if they are coming from the legitimate application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization by Application [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_validationsanitization_by_application__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Pass Untrusted Data Directly to Elasticsearch-PHP Functions [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/pass_untrusted_data_directly_to_elasticsearch-php_functions__high-risk_path_.md)

The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input before using it in Elasticsearch queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Parameter/Body Injection (see above) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_parameterbody_injection__see_above___high-risk_path_.md)

This lack of validation directly leads to the Parameter and Body Injection vulnerabilities described earlier.
