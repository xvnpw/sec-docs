# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-php

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./threats/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user input that is directly incorporated into an Elasticsearch query string *via the `elasticsearch-php` library*. By injecting malicious Elasticsearch query syntax, they could bypass intended access controls, retrieve sensitive data they are not authorized to see, modify or delete data, or potentially even impact the performance of the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification or deletion, denial of service on the Elasticsearch cluster.

**Affected Component:** Query building functionality (e.g., when manually constructing queries instead of using the library's query DSL builder), `search()` method, and other methods that execute queries within `elasticsearch-php`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use the `elasticsearch-php` library's query builder methods to construct queries programmatically instead of directly concatenating strings.**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data *before* it is used to build queries with `elasticsearch-php`.
*   Adopt parameterized queries or similar techniques if available within the library's query builder.
*   Enforce the principle of least privilege for Elasticsearch user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Elasticsearch Credentials](./threats/insecure_handling_of_elasticsearch_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to the Elasticsearch credentials used by the `elasticsearch-php` library if the application stores or handles these credentials insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in the code where `elasticsearch-php` is initialized, stored in plain text configuration files accessible to the application). This would allow the attacker to directly interact with the Elasticsearch cluster with the application's privileges *through the compromised `elasticsearch-php` client*.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Elasticsearch cluster, including the ability to read, modify, and delete any data.

**Affected Component:** Client configuration within `elasticsearch-php` (e.g., when setting up the Elasticsearch client with connection parameters and credentials).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Store Elasticsearch credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault), or secure configuration management tools, and retrieve them securely when configuring the `elasticsearch-php` client.**
*   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code where the `elasticsearch-php` client is instantiated.
*   Restrict access to configuration files containing credentials used by `elasticsearch-php`.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Elasticsearch Responses (Less Likely, but Possible)](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_elasticsearch_responses__less_likely__but_possible_.md)

**Description:** Although less common with standard JSON responses, if the `elasticsearch-php` library or its dependencies have vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization, malicious data returned by Elasticsearch *and processed by `elasticsearch-php`* could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the application server. This is more relevant if custom serialization/deserialization is involved within the application's interaction with `elasticsearch-php`'s response handling.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server.

**Affected Component:** Response handling and data deserialization within the `elasticsearch-php` library's core functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High (if exploitable)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep the `elasticsearch-php` library and its dependencies up-to-date to patch any known deserialization vulnerabilities.**
*   Avoid custom serialization/deserialization logic when working with `elasticsearch-php` responses if possible. Rely on the library's built-in mechanisms.
*   Implement robust input validation on data received from Elasticsearch *after it has been processed by `elasticsearch-php`*, even if it's expected to be controlled.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Elasticsearch Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_elasticsearch_communication.md)

**Description:** If the communication between the application (using `elasticsearch-php`) and the Elasticsearch cluster is not properly secured with TLS/SSL *when configured within the `elasticsearch-php` client*, an attacker could intercept and potentially modify the data being transmitted, including sensitive information or query results.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Client configuration within `elasticsearch-php` related to connection security (e.g., enabling HTTPS, verifying certificates).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always configure the `elasticsearch-php` client to use HTTPS for communication with the Elasticsearch cluster.**
*   Verify the SSL/TLS certificate of the Elasticsearch server *when configuring the `elasticsearch-php` client* to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Ensure that the Elasticsearch cluster itself is configured to enforce TLS/SSL.
