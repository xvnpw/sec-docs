## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Elasticsearch-PHP ***[HIGH RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_elasticsearch-php__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Manipulation ***[HIGH RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_manipulation__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on attackers manipulating the requests sent from the application to the Elasticsearch server.

*   **Inject Malicious Elasticsearch Queries:** This is the core of this high-risk path. Attackers aim to insert malicious code or commands within the Elasticsearch queries executed by the application.
    *   **Identify Injection Point in Application Logic:**  Attackers first need to find weaknesses in the application's code where user-controlled input is directly used to build Elasticsearch queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
        *   **Identify User Input Directly Used in Query:** This involves finding code where user-provided data (like search terms) is simply concatenated into the query string.
        *   **Identify Vulnerable Parameter in Application API:** Attackers look for API endpoints where parameters intended for filtering or searching are not validated and are directly incorporated into Elasticsearch queries.
    *   **Craft Malicious Query:** Once an injection point is found, attackers craft specific Elasticsearch queries to achieve their goals.
        *   **Inject Aggregation Pipeline for Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers use Elasticsearch's aggregation features to extract sensitive data that the application might not normally expose. They construct aggregations to group and retrieve specific data based on their criteria.
        *   **Inject Script Query for Code Execution (if enabled):** If Elasticsearch scripting is enabled, attackers can inject script queries (often using Painless) to execute arbitrary code directly on the Elasticsearch server. This can lead to complete system compromise.
        *   **Inject Delete/Update Query for Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Attackers can craft queries to modify or delete data within Elasticsearch indices, potentially causing data loss, corruption, or application instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Injection Point in Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/identify_injection_point_in_application_logic.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Identify User Input Directly Used in Query ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/identify_user_input_directly_used_in_query__critical_node_.md)

These are the primary entry points for successful query injection attacks, leading to potential data breaches and code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Parameter in Application API ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_parameter_in_application_api__critical_node_.md)

These are the primary entry points for successful query injection attacks, leading to potential data breaches and code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious Query](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_query.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Aggregation Pipeline for Data Exfiltration ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_aggregation_pipeline_for_data_exfiltration__critical_node_.md)

Successful exploitation via crafted queries directly results in data exfiltration, code execution on the Elasticsearch server, or data manipulation/deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Script Query for Code Execution (if enabled) ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_script_query_for_code_execution__if_enabled___critical_node_.md)

Successful exploitation via crafted queries directly results in data exfiltration, code execution on the Elasticsearch server, or data manipulation/deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Delete/Update Query for Data Manipulation/Deletion ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_deleteupdate_query_for_data_manipulationdeletion__critical_node_.md)

Successful exploitation via crafted queries directly results in data exfiltration, code execution on the Elasticsearch server, or data manipulation/deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in elasticsearch-php Library ***[HIGH RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_elasticsearch-php_library__high_risk_path_.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities present within the `elasticsearch-php` library itself.

*   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Version:**  Attackers identify the exact version of the `elasticsearch-php` library being used by the application. They then search for publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities associated with that specific version.
    *   **Identify Outdated or Vulnerable Version of elasticsearch-php:**  This is a crucial first step for the attacker. They might use techniques like examining dependency files or triggering errors that reveal the library version.
*   **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Although less common in modern PHP libraries, if the `elasticsearch-php` library mishandles deserialization of data, attackers could inject malicious serialized objects. When these objects are unserialized, they can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Version ***[HIGH RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_version__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Outdated or Vulnerable Version of elasticsearch-php ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/identify_outdated_or_vulnerable_version_of_elasticsearch-php__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical step that enables attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities in the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Serialized Data if Library Improperly Handles Deserialization (Less likely but possible) ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_serialized_data_if_library_improperly_handles_deserialization__less_likely_but_poss_bf7c31af.md)

Successful exploitation of a deserialization vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, granting the attacker significant control over the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration of elasticsearch-php ***[HIGH RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_of_elasticsearch-php__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on security weaknesses arising from improper configuration of the `elasticsearch-php` library and its interaction with the Elasticsearch server.

*   **Insecure Handling of Elasticsearch Credentials:** This involves the unsafe storage or management of the credentials used by the application to authenticate with the Elasticsearch server.
    *   **Expose Credentials in Application Code or Configuration Files:**  Attackers look for hardcoded credentials directly within the application's source code or in easily accessible configuration files.
*   **Improperly Configured Connection Settings:** This refers to insecure settings related to the connection between the application and the Elasticsearch server.
    *   **Lack of TLS/SSL Encryption:** If the connection to the Elasticsearch server is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, attackers can intercept the communication and potentially steal sensitive data being transmitted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of Elasticsearch Credentials ***[HIGH RISK PATH]***](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_elasticsearch_credentials__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Credentials in Application Code or Configuration Files ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/expose_credentials_in_application_code_or_configuration_files__critical_node_.md)

Gaining access to Elasticsearch credentials provides the attacker with full access to the data stored in Elasticsearch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improperly Configured Connection Settings](./attack_tree_paths/improperly_configured_connection_settings.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of TLS/SSL Encryption ***[CRITICAL NODE]***](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_tlsssl_encryption__critical_node_.md)

Successful exploitation allows attackers to intercept and potentially modify sensitive data being exchanged between the application and the Elasticsearch server.
