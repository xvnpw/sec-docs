# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-php

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch DSL Injection](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_dsl_injection.md)

**Description:**  An attacker can inject malicious Elasticsearch Domain Specific Language (DSL) commands into queries executed by the application. This happens when user-controlled data is directly incorporated into query strings without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**How Elasticsearch-PHP Contributes:** The library provides functions to build and execute queries. If the application uses these functions to construct queries by directly concatenating user input, it becomes vulnerable. For example, using string interpolation to add user-provided search terms directly into the `query` parameter.

**Example:** An application allows users to search by name. The code might construct a query like this: `['body' => ['query' => ['match' => ['name' => $_GET['username']]]]]`. An attacker could input `* OR _id:1` as the username, potentially retrieving all documents.

**Impact:**
* Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data).
* Data manipulation (updating or deleting data).
* Denial of service (executing resource-intensive queries).
* In some configurations, potentially remote code execution if scripting is enabled and insecure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use parameterized queries:**  Utilize the library's features for building queries programmatically, avoiding direct string manipulation of user input. Pass user input as separate parameters.
* **Input validation and sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into Elasticsearch queries. Use whitelisting to allow only expected characters or patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/credential_exposure.md)

**Description:**  Sensitive credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) required to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster are exposed, allowing unauthorized access.

**How Elasticsearch-PHP Contributes:** The library requires connection details to be configured. If these details are hardcoded in the application, stored in publicly accessible files, or managed insecurely, they can be compromised.

**Example:**  Connection details are hardcoded directly in a PHP file: `$client = ClientBuilder::create()->setHosts(['http://user:password@localhost:9200'])->build();`. This file is then accidentally committed to a public repository.

**Impact:**
* Complete compromise of the Elasticsearch cluster.
* Unauthorized access to and manipulation of data.
* Potential for using the compromised cluster as part of further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Store credentials securely:** Use environment variables, dedicated secret management systems (like HashiCorp Vault), or secure configuration files with restricted access.
* **Avoid hardcoding credentials:** Never embed credentials directly in the application code.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection__man-in-the-middle_.md)

**Description:** Communication between the application and the Elasticsearch cluster is not encrypted, allowing attackers to intercept and potentially modify data in transit.

**How Elasticsearch-PHP Contributes:** The library connects to Elasticsearch based on the provided configuration. If HTTPS is not enforced or properly configured, the connection can be vulnerable.

**Example:** The application connects to Elasticsearch using `http://localhost:9200` instead of `https://localhost:9200`, leaving the communication unencrypted.

**Impact:**
* Confidential data sent to or received from Elasticsearch can be intercepted.
* Attackers could potentially modify data in transit, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
* Credentials could be intercepted if not transmitted over HTTPS.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS:** Always use `https://` in the Elasticsearch host configuration.
* **Configure TLS/SSL verification:** Ensure the `elasticsearch-php` client is configured to verify the SSL certificate of the Elasticsearch server to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks even with HTTPS.

## Attack Surface: [Bulk Operation Abuse](./attack_surfaces/bulk_operation_abuse.md)

**Description:**  If the application uses the `elasticsearch-php` library to perform bulk operations and the data for these operations is derived from user input without proper validation, attackers could manipulate multiple documents or perform unintended actions.

**How Elasticsearch-PHP Contributes:** The library provides functionality for bulk indexing, updating, and deleting documents. If the application constructs bulk requests based on user input without validation, it's vulnerable.

**Example:** An application allows users to tag multiple documents. If the document IDs and tags are taken directly from user input without validation, an attacker could craft a request to tag unintended documents with malicious tags.

**Impact:**
* Mass data modification or deletion.
* Denial of service by overloading the Elasticsearch cluster with bulk requests.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Validate data for bulk operations:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all data used to construct bulk requests, including document IDs and any data being updated or inserted.
* **Implement authorization checks:** Ensure the user has the necessary permissions to perform the bulk operations on the targeted documents.
