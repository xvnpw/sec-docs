# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-php

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication Leading to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks](./threats/unencrypted_communication_leading_to_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks.md)

* **Description:** The `elasticsearch-php` library, if not explicitly configured to use TLS/SSL, will establish an unencrypted connection to the Elasticsearch cluster. An attacker on the network can intercept this communication to eavesdrop on sensitive data being exchanged (e.g., search queries, indexed data) or even modify requests and responses before they reach the intended destination.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data transmitted via the `elasticsearch-php` library is exposed to the attacker.
        * **Data Integrity Compromise:** An attacker can alter data being sent to or received from Elasticsearch through the unencrypted channel managed by the library.
        * **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker might be able to send malicious queries or commands to Elasticsearch on behalf of the application by manipulating requests.
    * **Affected Component:** Transport Layer (Client Builder, Connection classes - specifically the handling of the `scheme` option).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Configure the `elasticsearch-php` client to use the `https` scheme when building the client. This ensures the library establishes a secure connection.
        * **Verify Server Certificates:** Configure the client to verify the server's TLS certificate to prevent connecting to potentially malicious Elasticsearch instances masquerading as legitimate ones. This can be done through client options related to certificate verification.

## Threat: [Connection Hijacking due to Insecure Authentication Handling](./threats/connection_hijacking_due_to_insecure_authentication_handling.md)

* **Description:** The `elasticsearch-php` library relies on the application to provide authentication credentials. If these credentials are not handled securely within the application or if the Elasticsearch cluster itself has weak or no authentication, an attacker who gains access to the application's configuration or runtime environment could potentially use the `elasticsearch-php` library to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster with the compromised credentials.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can leverage the `elasticsearch-php` library and stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch cluster.
        * **Data Breach:** The attacker can read, modify, or delete data within the Elasticsearch cluster using the compromised connection facilitated by the library.
        * **Malicious Operations:** The attacker could perform destructive or unauthorized operations on the Elasticsearch cluster via the library.
    * **Affected Component:** Client Builder (handling of `http.user` and `http.pass` or API key configurations), Transport Layer (using the provided credentials).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Credential Storage:** Store Elasticsearch credentials securely using environment variables, dedicated secret management tools, or secure configuration files with restricted access. Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application code.
        * **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure the Elasticsearch user configured in the `elasticsearch-php` client has the minimum necessary privileges required for the application's functionality.
        * **Implement Elasticsearch Security Features:** Enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms on the Elasticsearch cluster itself (e.g., using Elasticsearch Security features like basic authentication, API keys, or a security plugin).

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities through Unsafe Query Construction via the Library](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_through_unsafe_query_construction_via_the_library.md)

* **Description:** While the application logic is primarily responsible for constructing queries, the `elasticsearch-php` library offers methods that, if used improperly, can lead to injection vulnerabilities. If the application uses string concatenation or insufficient sanitization when building query parameters that are then passed to the `elasticsearch-php` client's methods, an attacker can inject malicious code into the Elasticsearch query.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Data Breach:** An attacker can craft malicious queries through the `elasticsearch-php` library to retrieve sensitive data they are not authorized to access.
        * **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can use the library to send queries that modify or delete data within Elasticsearch.
        * **Potential for Script Injection (depending on Elasticsearch configuration and plugins):** In specific scenarios, injected code might be interpreted and executed by Elasticsearch.
    * **Affected Component:** `Search` module (especially methods taking query arrays or bodies), `Bulk` module, any module where query parameters are constructed and passed to the library.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Utilize Elasticsearch Query DSL:**  Use the `elasticsearch-php` library's Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) to build queries programmatically. This approach helps prevent direct string manipulation and encourages safer query construction.
        * **Parameterize Where Possible:**  Utilize any parameterization features offered by the library (though less common in NoSQL contexts).
        * **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input before incorporating it into any part of the Elasticsearch query that is passed to the `elasticsearch-php` library.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Malicious Data (Potential Future Risk within the Library)](./threats/deserialization_of_malicious_data__potential_future_risk_within_the_library_.md)

* **Description:** If future versions of the `elasticsearch-php` library introduce features that involve deserializing data received from Elasticsearch or provided as input without proper validation, it could introduce deserialization vulnerabilities. An attacker could provide malicious serialized data that, when processed by the library, could lead to arbitrary code execution on the application server.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Remote Code Execution:** A successful deserialization attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the application.
        * **Full System Compromise:** This could lead to complete control over the application server and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
    * **Affected Component:**  Potentially new components related to data serialization/deserialization if introduced in future versions of the library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (if such a vulnerability were to be introduced)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Stay Updated:** Keep the `elasticsearch-php` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Regularly check for security advisories related to the `elasticsearch-php` library and its dependencies.
        * **Input Validation (if deserialization is introduced):** If future versions introduce deserialization, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the processing of malicious serialized data.

## Threat: [Use of Outdated or Vulnerable Versions of the `elasticsearch-php` Library](./threats/use_of_outdated_or_vulnerable_versions_of_the__elasticsearch-php__library.md)

* **Description:** Using an outdated version of the `elasticsearch-php` library exposes the application to known vulnerabilities that have been discovered and patched in later versions. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the version of the library being used.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Varies depending on the specific vulnerability:** Could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution.
        * **Compromise of Application or Elasticsearch Cluster:** Exploitable vulnerabilities in the library can be a direct pathway to compromising the application or the Elasticsearch cluster it interacts with.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire library codebase.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Dependency Management:** Implement a robust dependency management strategy to track and update dependencies regularly.
        * **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Ensure the `elasticsearch-php` library is kept up-to-date with the latest stable version.
        * **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application's dependencies to identify and address outdated or vulnerable libraries.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists for the `elasticsearch-php` library and related projects to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
