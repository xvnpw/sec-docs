# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch-php

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Query Injection](./threats/elasticsearch_query_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Elasticsearch Query Injection
*   **Description**:
    *   An attacker crafts malicious input that is incorporated into Elasticsearch queries constructed using `elasticsearch-php` without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   The attacker can manipulate the query logic to bypass intended access controls, retrieve unauthorized data, modify or delete data, or cause denial of service by crafting resource-intensive queries.
*   **Impact**:
    *   Data breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Elasticsearch.
    *   Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of data within Elasticsearch.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading Elasticsearch with malicious queries, making it unavailable.
*   **Affected Elasticsearch-php Component**:
    *   Query DSL building functions (e.g., `search()`, `count()`, `update()`, `delete()`, and their associated query body construction).
    *   Potentially any function that allows constructing and sending raw queries if string concatenation is used insecurely.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries/Query DSL:**  Always utilize the `elasticsearch-php` Query DSL to construct queries programmatically. Avoid string concatenation of user input directly into query bodies.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before using it in Elasticsearch queries, even when using the Query DSL.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Elasticsearch users used by the application only the necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Insufficient Authentication Configuration](./threats/insufficient_authentication_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Authentication Configuration
*   **Description**:
    *   The application is configured using `elasticsearch-php` to connect to Elasticsearch with weak or no authentication.
    *   Or, the authentication method configured in `elasticsearch-php` does not match the security requirements of the Elasticsearch cluster.
*   **Impact**:
    *   Unauthorized Elasticsearch Access: Anyone who can reach the Elasticsearch endpoint can access and potentially control it.
    *   Data Breach, Data Manipulation, DoS: Consequences of unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Elasticsearch-php Component**:
    *   Client initialization and configuration options related to authentication (e.g., `setBasicAuthentication()`, API key configuration).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Enforce Strong Authentication:** Always configure strong authentication when initializing the `elasticsearch-php` client, using methods like API keys or username/password with TLS.
    *   **Match Elasticsearch Security Policies:** Ensure the authentication method configured in `elasticsearch-php` strictly adheres to the security policies of the Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit the authentication configuration of the application and Elasticsearch.

## Threat: [Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Library Vulnerabilities
*   **Description**:
    *   The `elasticsearch-php` library code might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities.
    *   Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to various impacts.
*   **Impact**:
    *   Varies widely depending on the vulnerability. Potential for Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, etc.
*   **Affected Elasticsearch-php Component**:
    *   Potentially any part of the `elasticsearch-php` library code, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Potential for High to Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Keep `elasticsearch-php` Updated:**  Always use the latest stable version of the `elasticsearch-php` library and update regularly.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and announcements related to `elasticsearch-php`.
    *   **Security Audits (for critical applications):** For highly critical applications, consider periodic security audits of `elasticsearch-php` usage.
