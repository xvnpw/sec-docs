# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, elasticsearch-php, provides a PHP client library for Elasticsearch.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Enable PHP developers to easily integrate Elasticsearch into their applications.
  - Provide a reliable, performant, and feature-complete client that supports various Elasticsearch versions.
  - Lower the barrier to entry for PHP developers to utilize Elasticsearch's search and analytics capabilities.
  - Foster the adoption of Elasticsearch within the PHP ecosystem.

- Most important business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the client library could expose applications and Elasticsearch clusters to attacks.
  - Incompatibility issues with different Elasticsearch versions could lead to application failures and developer frustration.
  - Performance bottlenecks in the client could negatively impact application performance.
  - Lack of proper documentation or support could hinder adoption and increase development costs for users.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies of the client library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Reliance on Elasticsearch security features for authentication, authorization, and data encryption. Described in Elasticsearch documentation.
  - security control: Input validation within the client library to prevent injection attacks. Implemented in the client code.
  - security control: Secure coding practices followed during development. Assumed based on project maturity and community.
  - security control: Usage of HTTPS for communication with Elasticsearch. Configurable in client settings.

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in underlying dependencies. Mitigated by dependency updates and security scanning.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of Elasticsearch security settings by users. User responsibility, documented in Elasticsearch documentation.
  - accepted risk: Client-side vulnerabilities with limited impact due to the nature of a client library. Mitigated by prompt patching and updates.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Automated security scanning of the client library and its dependencies in CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to manage and monitor open source dependencies.
  - security control: Security awareness training for developers contributing to the project.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The client must support various Elasticsearch authentication mechanisms (e.g., basic authentication, API keys).
    - Requirement: Authentication credentials should be handled securely and not hardcoded in the client code.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The client should respect Elasticsearch's role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure users only access authorized resources.
    - Requirement: The client should not bypass Elasticsearch's authorization mechanisms.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: The client must validate user inputs before sending them to Elasticsearch to prevent injection attacks (e.g., Elasticsearch Query DSL injection).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be implemented on both client-side and server-side (Elasticsearch).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Communication between the client and Elasticsearch should be encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: The client should support Elasticsearch's encryption features for data at rest and in transit.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment of the elasticsearch-php client library is inherently tied to the deployment of the PHP application that uses it.  Possible deployment architectures for PHP applications include:

- On-Premise Servers: Traditional deployment on physical or virtual servers within a company's data center.
- Cloud VMs (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine): Deployment on virtual machines in the cloud.
- Containerized Environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes): Deployment within containers orchestrated by platforms like Kubernetes.
- Serverless Platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, GCP Cloud Functions):  Less common for full applications but possible for specific use cases.
- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk): Deployment on PaaS platforms that manage the underlying infrastructure.

Let's consider a common deployment scenario: **Containerized Environment (Kubernetes)**

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
  - For the elasticsearch-php client itself, the critical process is providing a secure and reliable way for PHP applications to interact with Elasticsearch.
  - For applications using the client, critical processes depend on the application's purpose. Examples include: e-commerce search, application logging and monitoring, data analytics dashboards, content management system search.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - The elasticsearch-php client itself does not store data. It facilitates access to data stored in Elasticsearch.
  - Data sensitivity depends entirely on the data stored and processed by the Elasticsearch cluster and the applications using the client. This could range from publicly available data to highly sensitive personal or financial information.
  - The client needs to protect authentication credentials used to access Elasticsearch and ensure secure communication to prevent data breaches or unauthorized access to Elasticsearch data.
