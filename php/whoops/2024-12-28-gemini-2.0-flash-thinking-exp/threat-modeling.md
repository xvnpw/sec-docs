Here are the high and critical threats directly involving the `filp/whoops` library:

* **Threat:** Unintended Information Disclosure in Production
    * **Description:** An attacker could potentially gain access to detailed error pages generated by Whoops if it is mistakenly left enabled in a production environment or if access controls are misconfigured. The attacker might directly browse to error-triggering URLs or exploit vulnerabilities that cause errors to be displayed.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application internals, including file paths, code snippets, environment variables (potentially containing database credentials, API keys, etc.), and the application's internal structure. This information can be used to identify vulnerabilities, bypass security measures, or gain unauthorized access.
    * **Affected Whoops Component:**  The `PrettyPageHandler` component is responsible for rendering the detailed error page. The core Whoops library itself is responsible for catching and processing exceptions.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strictly disable Whoops in production environments.** Implement environment-based configuration to ensure Whoops is only active in development or testing.
        * **Implement robust environment detection.** Use environment variables or configuration settings to reliably determine the current environment.
        * **Secure deployment pipelines.** Ensure that deployment processes automatically disable Whoops or remove it entirely from production builds.
        * **Regular security audits.** Review application configuration and deployment processes to identify and rectify any misconfigurations that could expose Whoops in production.

* **Threat:** Information Leakage through Verbose Error Messages
    * **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information directly within exception messages or error logs that are then displayed by Whoops. This could include database query parameters, API keys, or other confidential data.
    * **Impact:** Direct exposure of sensitive credentials or data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
    * **Affected Whoops Component:** The core Whoops library and any custom exception handling logic that feeds information to Whoops.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement strict guidelines for error message content.** Ensure that error messages do not contain sensitive information.
        * **Review error logging practices.** Regularly audit error logs and exception handling code to identify and remove any potential leaks.
        * **Utilize generic error messages for end-users.** Provide user-friendly error messages to end-users while maintaining detailed (but sanitized) information for developers in non-production environments.
        * **Filter sensitive data before logging or displaying errors.** Implement mechanisms to redact or remove sensitive information before it reaches the error handler.
