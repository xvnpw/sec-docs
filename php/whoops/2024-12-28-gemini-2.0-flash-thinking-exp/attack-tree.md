**Threat Model: Compromising Application via Whoops - High-Risk Sub-Tree**

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Whoops error handler library.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   Exploit Whoops Directly *** HIGH RISK PATH ***
    *   Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) **CRITICAL NODE**
        *   Exploit Vulnerability in Custom Handler **CRITICAL NODE**
            *   Inject Malicious Code into Custom Handler Logic
        *   Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability (if applicable) **CRITICAL NODE**
            *   Supply Malicious Serialized Data to Whoops
*   Leverage Whoops for Information Disclosure *** HIGH RISK PATH ***
    *   Expose Sensitive Application Data **CRITICAL NODE**
        *   Trigger Errors Revealing Database Credentials **CRITICAL NODE**
            *   Cause Application to Attempt Database Connection with Incorrect Credentials
        *   Trigger Errors Revealing API Keys **CRITICAL NODE**
            *   Cause Application to Interact with External API with Incorrect Keys

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Whoops Directly *** HIGH RISK PATH ***:**

This path represents the most direct and impactful way to compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Whoops library or its extensions.

*   **1.1 Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) **CRITICAL NODE**:** This is the most severe outcome, granting the attacker complete control over the server.
    *   **1.1.1 Exploit Vulnerability in Custom Handler **CRITICAL NODE**:** Whoops allows developers to define custom handlers for error display. If a custom handler doesn't properly sanitize input or has its own vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure deserialization, command injection), an attacker could exploit it.
        *   **Inject Malicious Code into Custom Handler Logic:** By crafting specific inputs or exploiting existing vulnerabilities in the custom handler's code, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code on the server. This could involve techniques like command injection, where the attacker manipulates input to execute system commands, or exploiting insecure deserialization, where malicious serialized data is processed, leading to code execution.
    *   **1.1.2 Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability (if applicable) **CRITICAL NODE**:** If Whoops or a custom handler processes serialized data (e.g., from cookies or POST requests) without proper validation, an attacker could inject malicious serialized objects leading to RCE.
        *   **Supply Malicious Serialized Data to Whoops:** Attackers can craft malicious serialized data and supply it to the application in a way that Whoops or a custom handler will process it. If the deserialization process is vulnerable, this can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**2. Leverage Whoops for Information Disclosure *** HIGH RISK PATH ***:**

Even without directly achieving RCE, the exposure of sensitive application data through Whoops can have severe consequences.

*   **2.1 Expose Sensitive Application Data **CRITICAL NODE**:** This involves triggering errors that inadvertently reveal confidential information.
    *   **2.1.1 Trigger Errors Revealing Database Credentials **CRITICAL NODE**:** Errors during database connection attempts might inadvertently display connection strings or usernames/passwords.
        *   **Cause Application to Attempt Database Connection with Incorrect Credentials:** By manipulating input or application state to force the application to attempt a database connection with incorrect credentials, an attacker can trigger error messages that might reveal the correct credentials or connection details.
    *   **2.1.2 Trigger Errors Revealing API Keys **CRITICAL NODE**:** Similar to database credentials, errors related to API calls might expose API keys.
        *   **Cause Application to Interact with External API with Incorrect Keys:** By manipulating input or application state to force the application to interact with an external API using incorrect keys, an attacker can trigger error messages that might reveal the valid API keys.
