# Threat Model Analysis for parse-community/parse-server

## Threat: [Insecure Default Master Key](./threats/insecure_default_master_key.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain full administrative control over the Parse Server instance and its data by exploiting the default Master Key if it's not changed during initial setup. They could use the Master Key to bypass authentication, modify data, delete collections, and even shut down the server through Parse Server's API.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application data and functionality directly through the Parse Server instance. Unauthorized access to all data, including user credentials and sensitive information managed by Parse Server. Potential data loss or corruption within the Parse Server database.

**Affected Component:**  Core Parse Server authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Immediately change the default `MASTER_KEY` environment variable to a strong, unique, and randomly generated value during the initial setup of Parse Server.
*   Securely store and manage the Master Key, limiting access to authorized personnel only.

## Threat: [Exploiting Weak Class-Level Permissions (CLP)](./threats/exploiting_weak_class-level_permissions__clp_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft API requests to the Parse Server to read, create, update, or delete data in Parse classes for which they should not have permissions due to overly permissive or incorrectly configured CLPs within Parse Server. This involves manipulating query parameters or request bodies sent to the Parse Server API.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, and potential data corruption directly within the Parse Server managed data. Users could gain access to other users' private data or manipulate application data in unintended ways through the Parse Server API.

**Affected Component:**  Parse Server's data access control and permissioning module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully define and restrict CLPs for each Parse class within Parse Server based on the principle of least privilege.
*   Regularly review and audit CLP configurations within Parse Server to ensure they align with the application's security requirements.
*   Utilize Parse Server's role-based access control (RBAC) for more granular permission management.

## Threat: [Bypassing Authentication via Exposed Master Key](./threats/bypassing_authentication_via_exposed_master_key.md)

**Description:** If the Master Key, a core component of Parse Server's security, is inadvertently exposed in client-side code, configuration files accessible through the web interacting with Parse Server, or insecure server-side logic making calls to Parse Server, an attacker can use it to bypass all authentication checks enforced by Parse Server and perform any action on the Parse Server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application through the Parse Server. Attackers can impersonate any user managed by Parse Server, modify any data stored within Parse Server, and potentially gain control of the underlying infrastructure if Parse Server is not properly isolated.

**Affected Component:**  Core Parse Server authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never include the Master Key in client-side code that interacts with Parse Server.
*   Avoid storing the Master Key directly in configuration files that might be accessible through the web interacting with Parse Server.
*   Restrict the use of the Master Key to trusted server-side environments and administrative tasks interacting directly with Parse Server.
*   Implement robust access controls and monitoring for any system that handles the Master Key used for Parse Server interactions.

## Threat: [NoSQL Injection through Unsanitized Input in Parse Queries](./threats/nosql_injection_through_unsanitized_input_in_parse_queries.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input that, when used in Parse queries (e.g., in Cloud Code functions executed by Parse Server or through the REST API of Parse Server), manipulates the underlying MongoDB query executed by Parse Server, allowing them to bypass security restrictions, retrieve unauthorized data managed by Parse Server, or even modify or delete data within the Parse Server database.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, and potential denial of service by crafting resource-intensive queries executed by Parse Server against its database.

**Affected Component:**  Parse Server's query processing and database interaction module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize and validate user input before using it in Parse queries within Cloud Code or when making API calls to Parse Server.
*   Utilize Parse Server's built-in query constraints and operators to avoid direct string concatenation in queries processed by Parse Server.
*   Avoid using raw MongoDB queries directly within Parse Server's context unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution regarding input sanitization.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Cloud Code Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_cloud_code_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit known security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or modules used within Cloud Code functions executed by Parse Server to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code within the Parse Server environment, or compromise data managed by Parse Server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution within the Parse Server environment, data breaches affecting data managed by Parse Server, and potential server takeover if the Parse Server environment is not properly isolated.

**Affected Component:**  Parse Server's Cloud Code execution environment and the Node.js runtime used by Parse Server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update all dependencies used in Cloud Code functions executed by Parse Server to their latest stable versions.
*   Implement a process for monitoring and addressing security vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Parse Server's Cloud Code.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the context of Parse Server's Cloud Code.
*   Consider using sandboxing or containerization for Cloud Code execution within Parse Server to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Coding Practices in Cloud Code](./threats/insecure_coding_practices_in_cloud_code.md)

**Description:** Poorly written Cloud Code functions executed by Parse Server can introduce vulnerabilities such as command injection, path traversal (within the Parse Server environment), or insecure handling of user input processed by Parse Server, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands within the Parse Server environment or access sensitive files accessible to Parse Server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution within the Parse Server environment, access to sensitive files accessible to the Parse Server, and potential server compromise of the Parse Server instance.

**Affected Component:**  Parse Server's Cloud Code execution environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing Cloud Code functions for Parse Server.
*   Perform thorough code reviews and security testing of Cloud Code deployed to Parse Server.
*   Avoid executing external commands based on user input within Parse Server's Cloud Code without proper sanitization.
*   Limit file system access within Cloud Code functions executed by Parse Server to only necessary paths.

## Threat: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (e.g., Path Traversal, Arbitrary File Upload)](./threats/file_upload_vulnerabilities__e_g___path_traversal__arbitrary_file_upload_.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the file upload functionality of Parse Server to upload malicious files (e.g., malware, scripts) to the server's file storage managed by Parse Server or overwrite existing files by manipulating file paths handled by Parse Server.

**Impact:** Server compromise of the Parse Server instance, malware distribution through files managed by Parse Server, and potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if uploaded files are served directly by or through Parse Server.

**Affected Component:**  Parse Server's file handling and storage module (e.g., GridFS adapter or S3 adapter configured for Parse Server).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation for file uploads handled by Parse Server, including checking file types, sizes, and content.
*   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal attacks within Parse Server's file storage.
*   Store uploaded files in a secure location outside the web server's document root serving Parse Server.
*   Configure the web server to prevent direct execution of uploaded files managed by Parse Server.
*   Consider using a dedicated object storage service (like AWS S3) with appropriate access controls configured for Parse Server.
