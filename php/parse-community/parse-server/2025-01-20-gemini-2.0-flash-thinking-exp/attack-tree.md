## Attack Tree Path: [Use of Default or Weak Master Key [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/use_of_default_or_weak_master_key__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Parse Server Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_parse_server_exploitation.md)

This is the root goal and is inherently critical. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Access Control Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_access_control_weaknesses.md)

This node is critical because successful exploitation directly leads to unauthorized data access, a primary target for attackers. Bypassing these controls undermines the fundamental security of the application's data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Session Management Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_session_management_flaws.md)

This node is critical because successful exploitation allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users, gaining access to their data and potentially their privileges. It's a gateway to many other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Parse Server Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_parse_server_configuration.md)

This node is critical because misconfigurations, especially concerning the Master Key, can grant attackers complete administrative control over the Parse Server and, consequently, the application's data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Class-Level Permissions (CLP)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_class-level_permissions__clp_.md)

*   **Craft Malicious Queries to Circumvent CLP Rules:** Attackers with an understanding of Parse Server's query language and CLP structure can craft queries that bypass the intended access restrictions, potentially exposing sensitive data. This path has a medium likelihood due to the complexity of crafting effective bypass queries, but the impact of unauthorized data access is high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Manipulate User Roles to Gain Unauthorized Access:** If vulnerabilities exist in how user roles are managed or updated, attackers might be able to elevate their privileges, gaining access to functionalities and data they shouldn't. The likelihood is lower due to the need for specific vulnerabilities in role management, but the impact of privilege escalation is significant.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Session Management Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_session_management_flaws.md)

This entire branch is considered a high-risk path due to the direct impact of gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Brute-Force or Dictionary Attack on User Credentials:** While the effort is low and skill level is beginner, the medium likelihood of success (especially against accounts with weak passwords) combined with the high impact of account compromise makes this a high-risk path.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Password Reset Mechanisms:** Vulnerabilities in the password reset process can allow attackers to take over user accounts. The medium likelihood and high impact make this a significant risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force or Dictionary Attack on User Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_or_dictionary_attack_on_user_credentials.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Password Reset Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_password_reset_mechanisms.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cloud Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cloud_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Code Injection in Cloud Functions:** Successful code injection allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a wide range of severe consequences, including data breaches and service disruption. The medium likelihood and high impact make this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection in Cloud Functions](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_in_cloud_functions.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Parse Server Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_parse_server_configuration.md)

*   **Use of Default or Weak Master Key:** This is a critical high-risk path. If the default Master Key is not changed or a weak key is used, attackers can gain full administrative control over the Parse Server. The likelihood depends on whether the administrators have followed security best practices, but the impact of a successful exploit is catastrophic.
