# Attack Surface Analysis for parse-community/parse-server

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected or Weakly Protected API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_or_weakly_protected_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:**  Parse Server exposes a RESTful API for data manipulation. If these endpoints lack proper authentication and authorization, attackers can bypass intended security measures.

**How Parse Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Parse Server's core functionality revolves around its API. The ease of defining data models and exposing them through the API makes it crucial to implement robust access controls. Misconfigured ACLs or CLPs directly lead to this vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker uses a REST client to send a `DELETE` request to `/parse/classes/Posts/someObjectId` without being logged in or having the necessary permissions, successfully deleting a post.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential data breaches; manipulation of application state.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust Authentication: Enforce user login and authentication for sensitive endpoints.
*   Utilize Access Control Lists (ACLs): Define granular permissions for individual objects, controlling who can read, write, or delete them.
*   Employ Class-Level Permissions (CLPs): Set default permissions for entire classes, simplifying access management.
*   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Cloud Code: Create custom logic to manage permissions based on user roles.
*   Regularly review and audit ACLs and CLPs: Ensure they are correctly configured and reflect the intended access policies.

## Attack Surface: [NoSQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/nosql_injection.md)

**Description:**  If user-supplied input is directly incorporated into Parse Server database queries (typically MongoDB) without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious NoSQL queries.

**How Parse Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While Parse Server provides some abstraction, developers can still construct complex queries using operators and parameters. If input used in `where` clauses or other query parameters isn't sanitized, it's vulnerable.

**Example:** A vulnerable Cloud Code function takes a username as input and uses it in a query like `new Parse.Query(Parse.User).equalTo("username", request.params.username).first()`. An attacker could provide a malicious username like `{$ne: null}` to bypass the username check.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data retrieval, modification, or deletion; potential for bypassing security checks; in some cases, potential for server-side code execution (though less common in MongoDB).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid direct string concatenation of user input in queries: Use Parse Server's query builder methods and parameters.
*   Sanitize user input:  While Parse Server handles some sanitization, be cautious with complex queries and consider additional sanitization for specific use cases.
*   Implement input validation:  Validate the format and type of user input before using it in queries.
*   Follow secure coding practices in Cloud Code: Be mindful of how user input is used in database interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cloud Code Logic](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cloud_code_logic.md)

**Description:**  Cloud Code allows developers to execute custom server-side logic. Vulnerabilities in this code can introduce various security risks.

**How Parse Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cloud Code extends Parse Server's functionality, allowing for complex business logic and integrations. However, this flexibility also introduces the risk of insecurely implemented features.

**Example:** A Cloud Code function designed to update user roles doesn't properly validate the new role being assigned, allowing an attacker to escalate their privileges to an administrator role.

**Impact:** Authentication and authorization bypass, information disclosure, remote code execution (if interacting with external systems insecurely), privilege escalation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices: Implement proper input validation, output encoding, and error handling in Cloud Code.
*   Implement robust authorization checks within Cloud Code: Don't rely solely on ACLs/CLPs; verify user permissions before performing sensitive actions.
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Cloud Code: Use environment variables or secure configuration management.
*   Regularly review and audit Cloud Code:  Look for potential vulnerabilities and logic flaws.
*   Limit the scope and privileges of Cloud Code functions:  Follow the principle of least privilege.
*   Be cautious when interacting with external APIs:  Validate responses and sanitize data.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads.md)

**Description:**  If file uploads are not properly validated and handled, attackers can upload malicious files.

**How Parse Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Parse Server provides built-in functionality for file storage. If not configured securely, this can be a significant entry point for attacks.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the server is not configured to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory, this script could be executed, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, cross-site scripting (if files are served directly), denial of service (by uploading large files), storage of illegal content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate file types:  Only allow specific, expected file types.
*   Sanitize file names:  Prevent path traversal attacks by sanitizing file names.
*   Limit file sizes:  Prevent denial of service through large file uploads.
*   Store uploaded files in a non-executable directory: Configure your web server to prevent the execution of scripts in the upload directory.
*   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with appropriate security configurations:  CDNs can help mitigate some risks associated with serving uploaded files.
*   Consider using a dedicated file storage service: Services like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage offer more robust security features.
