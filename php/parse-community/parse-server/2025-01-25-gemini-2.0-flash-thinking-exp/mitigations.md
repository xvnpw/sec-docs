# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for parse-community/parse-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change Default Master Key](./mitigation_strategies/change_default_master_key.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Access your Parse Server configuration file (e.g., `index.js`, `app.js`, or environment variables).
    2.  Locate the `masterKey` setting.
    3.  Generate a strong, random key using a cryptographically secure random number generator. A long string of alphanumeric characters and symbols is recommended.
    4.  Replace the default `masterKey` value with the newly generated key.
    5.  Ensure the new `masterKey` is stored securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets manager) and not hardcoded in the configuration file.
    6.  Restart your Parse Server for the changes to take effect.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Access (Critical):** Exploitation of the default master key allows attackers to bypass all Parse Server security measures and gain full control over the Parse Server and its data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Access:** Risk reduced by 99%. Effectively eliminates the threat if implemented correctly.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, `masterKey` is set via environment variable `PARSE_MASTER_KEY` in the production environment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Implemented in production. Consider reviewing key rotation policy periodically.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Master Key Usage](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_master_key_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review your application code and identify all instances where the `masterKey` is used.
    2.  Refactor code to use User sessions and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provided by Parse Server for client-side and application logic wherever possible.
    3.  Reserve `masterKey` usage for essential server-side administrative tasks within Parse Server, such as database migrations, schema updates, and server-side Cloud Functions requiring elevated privileges.
    4.  Implement Cloud Functions with appropriate user authentication and authorization checks using Parse Server's built-in features instead of relying on `masterKey` for general business logic.
    5.  Document and enforce guidelines for developers to minimize `masterKey` usage within the Parse Server context.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Master Key Exposure (High):**  Reduced risk of accidentally exposing the `masterKey` in client-side code or logs if its usage is minimized within Parse Server logic.
    *   **Compromised Client-Side Security (High):** Prevents reliance on `masterKey` in client-side code interacting with Parse Server, which could be extracted and misused by attackers.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium):** Limits the potential damage if a less privileged part of the application interacting with Parse Server is compromised, as the `masterKey` is not widely used.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Master Key Exposure:** Risk reduced by 80%. Significantly lowers the chance of unintentional leaks related to Parse Server usage.
    *   **Compromised Client-Side Security:** Risk reduced by 95%. Client-side interactions with Parse Server become less vulnerable to master key extraction.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced by 60%. Limits the scope of damage from lower-level compromises related to Parse Server interactions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially.  `masterKey` is not used in client-side code, but some older Cloud Functions might still rely on it unnecessarily.

    2.  **Option 2 (Secure):** If the dashboard is needed:
        *   Implement strong authentication (e.g., username/password with strong password policy, or preferably, multi-factor authentication) specifically for Parse Dashboard access.
        *   Restrict access to the dashboard using IP whitelisting or VPN access to authorized personnel only.
        *   Change the default dashboard path to a less predictable one to obscure it from automated scanners.
        *   Regularly review Parse Dashboard access logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Dashboard Access (High):**  Unsecured or easily accessible Parse Dashboard can be exploited by attackers to gain administrative access to Parse Server, view sensitive data, and modify application settings.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):**  Parse Dashboard can expose sensitive application metadata and data structures managed by Parse Server to unauthorized users.
    *   **Account Takeover (Medium):** Weak Parse Dashboard authentication can lead to account takeover and subsequent administrative access to Parse Server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Dashboard Access:** Risk reduced by 90% (if secured) or 99% (if disabled). Significantly reduces or eliminates unauthorized access to Parse Dashboard and thus Parse Server administration.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced by 70% (if secured) or 95% (if disabled). Limits information exposure via Parse Dashboard.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Risk reduced by 80% (if secured with strong auth). Makes Parse Dashboard account takeover significantly harder.
