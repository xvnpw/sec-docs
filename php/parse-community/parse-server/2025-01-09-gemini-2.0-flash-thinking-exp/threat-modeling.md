# Threat Model Analysis for parse-community/parse-server

## Threat: [Bypass of Class-Level Permissions](./threats/bypass_of_class-level_permissions.md)

**Description:** An attacker might discover and exploit vulnerabilities in Parse Server's permission checking logic or find misconfigurations that allow them to bypass class-level read/write permissions. This could involve crafting specific queries or API requests that circumvent the intended permission enforcement.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to or modification of data within a specific Parse Class, potentially leading to data breaches or data corruption affecting multiple users or the application's functionality.

**Affected Component:** `ParseQuery` module, `ParseACL` module, permission checking logic within the Parse Server core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Parse Server updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Thoroughly test class-level permission configurations with various user roles and scenarios.
*   Avoid complex or ambiguous permission rules that could be misinterpreted by the server.
*   Consider using Cloud Code triggers for more fine-grained authorization checks.

## Threat: [Weak Password Policies (Built-in Authentication)](./threats/weak_password_policies__built-in_authentication_.md)

**Description:** If relying on Parse Server's built-in user authentication, attackers could exploit weak or default password policies to easily guess or brute-force user passwords. They might use automated tools to try common passwords or variations.

**Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized access to user data and application features, potential for further attacks using compromised accounts.

**Affected Component:** `ParseUser` module, authentication middleware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure Parse Server to enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, inclusion of special characters, etc.).
*   Consider implementing password rotation requirements.
*   Encourage or force users to choose strong, unique passwords.
*   Consider integrating with a more robust authentication provider (e.g., Auth0, Firebase Authentication) for advanced security features.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Reset Mechanisms](./threats/insecure_password_reset_mechanisms.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit flaws in the password reset process, such as predictable reset tokens, lack of proper verification, or missing rate limiting, to hijack user accounts. They might intercept reset links or brute-force reset codes.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application functionality, potential for identity theft or further malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** `ParseUser` module, password reset functionality, email sending module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure password reset tokens are generated using cryptographically secure random numbers.
*   Implement rate limiting on password reset requests to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   Use email verification to confirm the identity of the user requesting a password reset.
*   Ensure reset links expire after a short period.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking or Fixation](./threats/session_hijacking_or_fixation.md)

**Description:** Attackers might attempt to steal or fix user session identifiers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This could involve techniques like cross-site scripting (though the focus is on Parse Server specifics), man-in-the-middle attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in Parse Server's session management.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and application functionality, ability to perform actions as the compromised user.

**Affected Component:** Session management middleware within Parse Server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Parse Server is configured to use secure session cookies (HttpOnly, Secure attributes).
*   Regenerate session IDs upon login to prevent session fixation attacks.
*   Implement proper session timeout mechanisms.
*   Enforce HTTPS to protect session cookies from interception.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Parse Queries](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_parse_queries.md)

**Description:** Attackers could inject malicious code or manipulate query parameters in Parse queries (e.g., using `find`, `equalTo`, `greaterThan`) if user input is not properly sanitized. This could allow them to bypass intended data access restrictions or retrieve unauthorized information from the database.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for data manipulation or deletion.

**Affected Component:** `ParseQuery` module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid constructing queries dynamically using raw user input.
*   Utilize Parse Server's query builders and parameterization features to prevent injection attacks.
*   Sanitize and validate user input before incorporating it into queries.

## Threat: [Insecure Cloud Code Functions](./threats/insecure_cloud_code_functions.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in custom Cloud Code functions, such as logic flaws, insecure API calls to external services, or improper handling of user input. This could lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data breaches, unauthorized actions, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Cloud Code execution environment, individual Cloud Code functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing Cloud Code.
*   Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within Cloud Code functions.
*   Avoid storing secrets directly in Cloud Code; use environment variables or secure configuration management.
*   Regularly review and audit Cloud Code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting permissions within Cloud Code.

## Threat: [Excessive Permissions Granted to Cloud Code](./threats/excessive_permissions_granted_to_cloud_code.md)

**Description:** Attackers who manage to exploit a vulnerability in a Cloud Code function could leverage overly broad permissions granted to that function (e.g., using the `useMasterKey`) to perform actions they would not normally be authorized to do, such as accessing or modifying sensitive data across the entire application.

**Impact:** Significant potential for data breaches, privilege escalation, and widespread impact on the application.

**Affected Component:** Cloud Code execution environment, permission management within Cloud Code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to Cloud Code functions.
*   Avoid using the `useMasterKey` unless absolutely necessary.
*   Carefully scope permissions to the specific resources and actions required by the function.

## Threat: [Exposed Configuration Files](./threats/exposed_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Attackers who gain access to accidentally exposed Parse Server configuration files (e.g., `index.js` containing database credentials or API keys) could obtain sensitive information necessary to compromise the application or its underlying infrastructure.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Parse Server instance, access to the database, potential for data breaches and further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Server deployment and configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store configuration details securely using environment variables or dedicated configuration management tools.
*   Ensure configuration files are not accessible from the webserver's public directory.
*   Implement proper access controls on configuration files.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Parse Server Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_parse_server_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying Node.js libraries and dependencies used by Parse Server. If these dependencies are not regularly updated, the application becomes susceptible to these exploits.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Node.js modules and dependencies used by Parse Server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Parse Server and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a process for monitoring and addressing security advisories for dependencies.
*   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address dependency vulnerabilities.
