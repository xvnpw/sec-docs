# Attack Surface Analysis for parse-community/parse-server

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected or Insecurely Protected API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_or_insecurely_protected_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Parse Server exposes REST API endpoints for data manipulation, user management, and other functionalities. Lack of proper authentication and authorization checks allows unauthorized access.
*   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server's core functionality revolves around these API endpoints. The security of these endpoints is directly managed through Parse Server's configuration and features like Class-Level Permissions (CLPs).
*   **Example:** An attacker could send a `GET` request to `/parse/classes/MySensitiveData` without proper authentication if the CLP for that class is not correctly configured, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement and enforce strict Class-Level Permissions (CLPs):** Configure CLPs to restrict access to data based on user roles and authentication status.
    *   **Require authentication for sensitive endpoints:** Ensure that endpoints requiring authentication are properly protected.
    *   **Use Parse Server's built-in authentication mechanisms:** Leverage features like user sessions and API keys appropriately.
    *   **Implement rate limiting:** Prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Endpoint Introspection and Complex Queries (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/graphql_endpoint_introspection_and_complex_queries__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If the GraphQL endpoint is enabled, attackers can use introspection to understand the data schema and craft complex queries to overload the server.
*   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server offers an optional GraphQL endpoint. Its implementation and configuration directly influence the risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses introspection to discover relationships between data types and then crafts a deeply nested query that consumes excessive server resources, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure through schema exploration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable the GraphQL endpoint if not required.**
    *   **Implement query complexity analysis and limiting:** Restrict the depth and complexity of GraphQL queries.
    *   **Disable introspection in production environments:** Prevent attackers from easily exploring the schema.
    *   **Implement proper authentication and authorization for GraphQL endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  When creating or updating Parse objects, if input data is directly used to set object fields without proper filtering, attackers can manipulate unintended fields.
*   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server's API allows clients to provide data for object creation and updates. The server's handling of this data determines the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** When updating a user profile, an attacker includes an `isAdmin: true` field in the request body, and if not properly filtered, this could elevate their privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicitly specify allowed fields for creation and updates:** Do not rely on simply accepting all input data.
    *   **Use Parse Server's `beforeSave` triggers to validate and sanitize input data:** Implement server-side logic to control which fields can be modified.
    *   **Avoid directly using client input to set object attributes without validation.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cloud Code (Server-Side Logic)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cloud_code__server-side_logic_.md)

*   **Description:** Custom server-side logic written using Parse Server's Cloud Code can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
*   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server provides the Cloud Code environment for extending server functionality. The security of this custom code is the developer's responsibility within the Parse Server context.
*   **Example:** A Cloud Code function that directly executes user-provided strings as database queries could be vulnerable to NoSQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (in severe cases), data breaches, privilege escalation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Follow secure coding practices in Cloud Code:** Sanitize inputs, avoid dynamic code execution based on user input.
    *   **Regularly audit and review Cloud Code for vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Keep npm dependencies in Cloud Code up-to-date:** Patch known vulnerabilities in used libraries.
    *   **Implement proper error handling and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.**
    *   **Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent NoSQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** If the file upload functionality lacks proper restrictions on file types, sizes, or content, attackers can upload malicious files.
*   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server provides file storage capabilities. The security depends on how upload restrictions and storage configurations are implemented within Parse Server.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the server doesn't properly validate the file type and the storage location is publicly accessible, this script could be executed.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, serving malware to users, storage exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strict file type validation:** Only allow specific, necessary file types.
    *   **Limit file sizes:** Prevent large file uploads that could lead to denial of service.
    *   **Sanitize file names:** Prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Store uploaded files in a secure location with appropriate access controls.**
    *   **Consider using a dedicated storage service with built-in security features.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Password Reset Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/insecure_password_reset_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the password reset process can allow attackers to take over user accounts.
*   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server provides built-in user management features, including password reset. The security of this process depends on its implementation and configuration within Parse Server.
*   **Example:** A password reset link contains a predictable token, allowing an attacker to guess it and reset another user's password.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use strong, unpredictable, and time-limited reset tokens.**
    *   **Implement proper verification steps during the password reset process (e.g., email confirmation).**
    *   **Avoid exposing sensitive information in password reset links.**
    *   **Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Class-Level Permissions (CLP)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_class-level_permissions__clp_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured CLPs can grant unintended access to data, leading to information disclosure or unauthorized modification.
*   **How Parse Server Contributes:** CLPs are a core security feature of Parse Server, directly controlling data access. Misconfiguration is a common source of vulnerabilities within the Parse Server ecosystem.
*   **Example:** A CLP for a sensitive data class is set to `public read access`, allowing anyone to view the data without authentication.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully review and configure CLPs for all classes:** Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Regularly audit CLP configurations.**
    *   **Use role-based access control (RBAC) with CLPs for more granular control.**
    *   **Thoroughly understand the implications of each CLP setting.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Parse Server Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_parse_server_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** If the Parse Server dashboard is accessible without proper authentication or from public networks, attackers can gain administrative access.
*   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server includes a dashboard for managing the application. Its accessibility is a configuration concern directly related to Parse Server setup.
*   **Example:** The dashboard is accessible on a public IP address without any authentication configured, allowing anyone to view and modify the application's data and settings.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the application's data and settings, potentially leading to complete compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure the Parse Server dashboard with strong authentication (e.g., username/password).**
    *   **Restrict access to the dashboard to specific IP addresses or networks.**
    *   **Disable the dashboard in production environments if not strictly necessary.
