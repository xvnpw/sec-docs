## 4. Component Descriptions

This section provides detailed descriptions of the major components within the Parse Server architecture:

* **Client Applications:**
    * Diverse platforms (mobile, web, IoT) interacting with the Parse Server API.
    * Utilize Parse SDKs for communication.
    * Initiate requests for data manipulation, user management, and other functionalities.

* **Parse Server:**
    * The core backend application, typically built using Node.js.
    * Centralized component responsible for processing client requests and managing application data.

    * **API Gateway:**
        * The single entry point for all incoming client requests.
        * Handles request routing, parsing, and may implement cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting and authentication checks.

    * **Request Handlers:**
        * Process specific API endpoint requests (e.g., creating objects, user login).
        * Contain the core business logic for each API function, orchestrating interactions with other components.

    * **Authentication & Authorization:**
        * Manages user identities, sessions, and authentication methods (e.g., username/password, OAuth).
        * Enforces access control policies to protect data and restrict actions based on user roles and permissions.

    * **Data Access Layer:**
        * Provides an abstraction layer for interacting with the underlying database system.
        * Handles data retrieval, persistence, querying, and potentially data transformation.

    * **Push Notification Service:**
        * Manages the process of sending push notifications to registered client devices.
        * Integrates with platform-specific push notification providers (APNs, FCM) to deliver messages.

    * **Cloud Code Engine:**
        * Enables developers to execute custom server-side logic in response to specific events or API calls.
        * Provides a sandboxed environment for running user-defined JavaScript code, extending server functionality.

    * **File Storage Adapter:**
        * Manages the storage and retrieval of files associated with Parse objects.
        * Supports various storage backends, abstracting the underlying storage mechanism (e.g., local filesystem, cloud storage services).

    * **LiveQuery Service:**
        * Provides real-time data synchronization capabilities to clients.
        * Utilizes WebSockets to push data updates to subscribed clients when changes occur in the database.

    * **Background Jobs:**
        * Allows scheduling and execution of server-side tasks asynchronously.
        * Useful for tasks like data processing, sending emails, or other operations that shouldn't block API request handling.

* **Database:**
    * The persistent storage layer for Parse Server's data.
    * Commonly MongoDB, but can also be PostgreSQL or other supported relational databases.
    * Stores application data, user credentials, session information, and other metadata.

* **Push Notification Providers:**
    * External services like Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
    * Responsible for the actual delivery of push notifications to target devices.

* **External Services:**
    * Integrations with third-party services to extend Parse Server's capabilities.
    * Examples include email providers for password resets, SMS gateways for phone verification, and analytics platforms.

* **File Storage:**
    * External storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) used by the File Storage Adapter.
    * Stores files uploaded by users or managed by the application.
