## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Master Key Exposure [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_master_key_exposure__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The master key grants unrestricted access to the entire Parse Server instance. If an attacker obtains the master key, they can bypass all security measures and perform any action, including reading, creating, updating, and deleting any data, modifying server configurations, and potentially gaining control of the underlying server.
* **Obtain Master Key via Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Many developers might forget to change the default master key during initial setup or in development environments. Attackers can easily try common default values to gain immediate access.
* **Obtain Master Key via Insecure Storage [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The master key might be stored insecurely in configuration files committed to version control systems, environment variables accessible through vulnerabilities, or in plain text on servers. Attackers can scan for these exposed secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Password Reset Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_password_reset_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Takeover Accounts via Weak Password Reset Flow [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the password reset mechanism is flawed (e.g., using predictable reset tokens, lacking proper email verification, or allowing password resets without prior authentication), attackers can exploit these weaknesses to initiate password resets for arbitrary user accounts and gain control of them.

## Attack Tree Path: [NoSQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/nosql_injection__critical_node_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Queries via API Parameters:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Similar to SQL injection, if user-supplied input used in database queries is not properly sanitized or parameterized, attackers can inject malicious NoSQL queries through API parameters (like the `where` clause). This allows them to bypass intended security checks, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even delete entire collections.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Direct Database Access (if enabled) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_direct_database_access__if_enabled___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the `allowDirectDatabaseAccess` option is enabled (which is strongly discouraged in production), attackers who gain any form of authenticated access (or if the feature is insecurely exposed) can directly execute arbitrary database commands. This grants them complete control over the data stored in the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cloud Code Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cloud_code_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code into Cloud Functions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If Cloud Code functions are not carefully written to handle user input and external data, attackers might be able to inject malicious code that gets executed on the server. This can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, or the installation of backdoors.
* **Bypass Authorization Checks in Cloud Functions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  If authorization logic within custom Cloud Functions is flawed or improperly implemented, attackers can bypass these checks and perform actions they are not authorized to perform.
* **Exploit Insecure Dependencies in Cloud Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Cloud Code often relies on third-party libraries (dependencies). If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities and are not regularly updated, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the Cloud Code environment and potentially the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rate Limiting Weaknesses [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rate_limiting_weaknesses__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Perform Brute-Force Attacks on Authentication [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If API endpoints, particularly the login endpoint, are not properly rate-limited, attackers can make numerous login attempts in a short period to guess user credentials. This significantly increases the likelihood of successfully compromising user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Unsecured Parse Dashboard [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/access_unsecured_parse_dashboard__critical_node_.md)

* **Access Dashboard with Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Similar to the master key, the Parse Dashboard might be left with default credentials. If attackers can access the dashboard with these defaults, they gain administrative control over the Parse Server instance.
* **Access Dashboard due to Missing Authentication [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** In some misconfigurations, the Parse Dashboard might be exposed without any authentication mechanism. This allows anyone who can access the URL to gain full administrative control.
