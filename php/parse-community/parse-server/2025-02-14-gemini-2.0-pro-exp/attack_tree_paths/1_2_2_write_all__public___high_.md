### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.2 Write All (Public)

**2.1 Vulnerability Definition:**

The "Write All (Public)" vulnerability arises when a Parse Server object's ACL is configured to grant write access to the `*` (asterisk) principal.  In Parse Server, the `*` principal represents *any* user, including unauthenticated users.  This means that anyone, without needing to log in or provide any credentials, can modify or delete the object.  This is a direct violation of the principle of least privilege.

**2.2 Exploitation Scenario Walkthrough:**

Let's assume a Parse Server application manages user profiles, and a `UserProfile` class exists.  A developer mistakenly sets the ACL of a specific `UserProfile` object to allow public write access.

1.  **Object ID Discovery:** An attacker might discover the `objectId` of the vulnerable `UserProfile` object through several means:
    *   **Previous Queries:** If the application exposes a list of users without proper filtering, the `objectId` might be included in the response.
    *   **Brute-Force/Guessing:**  `objectId`s are often predictable (though this is less likely with newer Parse Server versions that use more secure random IDs).  An attacker could attempt to guess the ID.
    *   **Leaked Information:** The `objectId` might be inadvertently exposed in client-side code, error messages, or logs.

2.  **Malicious Request (Modification):**  The attacker crafts a REST API request to modify the object:

    ```http
    PUT /parse/classes/UserProfile/<objectId>
    Host: <your-parse-server-address>
    X-Parse-Application-Id: <your-application-id>
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "firstName": "Malicious",
      "lastName": "Attacker",
      "email": "attacker@example.com"
    }
    ```

    Because the ACL allows public write access, the Parse Server processes this request *without* requiring any authentication headers (e.g., `X-Parse-Session-Token`).  The user profile is updated with the attacker's data.

3.  **Malicious Request (Deletion):**  Alternatively, the attacker could delete the object:

    ```http
    DELETE /parse/classes/UserProfile/<objectId>
    Host: <your-parse-server-address>
    X-Parse-Application-Id: <your-application-id>
    ```

    Again, no authentication is required, and the object is deleted.

**2.3 Impact Assessment:**

The impact of this vulnerability depends heavily on the type of data stored in the vulnerable object:

*   **User Profiles:**  Data modification could lead to impersonation, account takeover (if password reset information is stored), or reputational damage. Deletion could disrupt user access.
*   **Financial Data:**  Modification or deletion could lead to financial loss, fraud, or legal issues.
*   **Content Management:**  Modification could deface the application or inject malicious content. Deletion could result in data loss.
*   **IoT Device Data:**  Modification could disrupt device functionality or compromise device security. Deletion could render devices unusable.
*   **Sensitive Configuration Data:** Modification or deletion could compromise the entire application's security.

**2.4 Root Cause Analysis:**

The primary root causes are:

*   **Developer Error:**  The most common cause is a developer mistakenly setting the ACL to allow public write access. This can happen due to:
    *   Lack of understanding of Parse Server ACLs.
    *   Copy-pasting code without understanding its implications.
    *   Carelessness during development or testing.
*   **Insecure Defaults (Historically):**  Older versions of Parse Server might have had less secure default ACL settings, although this is less of an issue in recent versions.
*   **Lack of Code Reviews:**  Without proper code reviews, insecure ACL configurations can easily slip into production.
*   **Insufficient Testing:**  Security testing that specifically targets ACL vulnerabilities is often overlooked.

**2.5 Mitigation Strategies:**

1.  **Never Use Public Write ACLs:**  The most crucial mitigation is to *never* set an object's ACL to allow public write access (`"*"` with write permission).

2.  **Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Create Parse Roles (e.g., "Admin," "Editor," "User") and assign users to these roles.  Configure ACLs to grant write access only to specific roles.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Creating a role and granting write access to it
    const roleACL = new Parse.ACL();
    roleACL.setRoleWriteAccess("Admin", true);
    roleACL.setRoleReadAccess("Admin", true); // Example, also grant read
    roleACL.setPublicReadAccess(true); // Example, public read

    const myObject = new Parse.Object("MyClass");
    myObject.setACL(roleACL);
    myObject.set("someField", "someValue");
    myObject.save();
    ```

3.  **Use User-Specific ACLs:**  For objects that should only be modifiable by their owner, set the ACL to grant write access only to the user who created the object.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Setting ACL to allow only the current user to write
    const user = Parse.User.current();
    const acl = new Parse.ACL(user);
    acl.setPublicReadAccess(true); // Example, public read

    const myObject = new Parse.Object("MyClass");
    myObject.setACL(acl);
    myObject.set("someField", "someValue");
    myObject.save(null, { useMasterKey: true }); // Often needed when setting ACLs
    ```

4.  **Cloud Code Validation:**  Use Parse Cloud Code `beforeSave` and `beforeDelete` triggers to enforce additional security checks.  This allows you to implement custom logic that goes beyond basic ACLs.

    ```javascript
    // Example: Cloud Code beforeSave trigger
    Parse.Cloud.beforeSave("MyClass", async (request) => {
      const user = request.user;
      const object = request.object;

      // Check if the user is allowed to modify this object
      if (!user) {
        throw new Parse.Error(401, "Unauthorized");
      }

      // Example: Only allow modification if the user is the owner
      if (object.existed() && object.get("owner").id !== user.id) {
          throw new Parse.Error(403, "Forbidden");
      }

      // Additional validation logic...
    });
    ```

5.  **Default ACLs:** Configure default ACLs at the class level to restrict write access by default. This provides a safety net if individual object ACLs are not explicitly set.  This can be done in the Parse Server dashboard or via the REST API.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your Parse Server application, including a review of ACL configurations.

**2.6 Detection Methods:**

1.  **Code Review:**  Manually inspect your code for any instances where ACLs are set to allow public write access.  Look for `setPublicWriteAccess(true)` or ACLs that grant write access to the `*` principal.

2.  **Database Queries:**  Query your Parse Server database directly to identify objects with insecure ACLs.  You can use the Parse Dashboard's Data Browser or the REST API to query the `_SCHEMA` table and then individual class tables.  Look for ACLs where the `*` key has a `w` (write) permission.

3.  **Automated Scanning Tools:**  Develop or use custom scripts to automatically scan your Parse Server database for objects with public write ACLs.

4.  **Logging and Monitoring:**  Monitor Parse Server logs for any unusual write or delete operations that might indicate exploitation of this vulnerability.

**2.7 Prevention Best Practices:**

1.  **Education and Training:**  Ensure that all developers working with Parse Server are thoroughly trained on ACLs and secure coding practices.

2.  **Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews that specifically focus on security aspects, including ACL configurations.

3.  **Least Privilege Principle:**  Always follow the principle of least privilege.  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and roles.

4.  **Secure Defaults:**  Configure your Parse Server with secure default ACLs for all classes.

5.  **Regular Updates:**  Keep your Parse Server and related libraries up to date to benefit from security patches and improvements.

**2.8 Testing Recommendations:**

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests to verify that your Cloud Code functions correctly enforce ACL restrictions.

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Create integration tests that simulate different user roles and attempt to modify or delete objects.  These tests should verify that unauthorized access is denied.

3.  **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including misconfigured ACLs.

4.  **Fuzzing:** Consider using fuzzing techniques to test the robustness of your ACL implementation by sending unexpected or malformed requests.

By following these recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of the "Write All (Public)" vulnerability and improve the overall security of your Parse Server application. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and improvement are essential.
