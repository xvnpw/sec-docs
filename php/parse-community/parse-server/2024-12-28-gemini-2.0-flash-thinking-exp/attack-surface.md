Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Parse Server, with high and critical severity:

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Data Access**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can access or modify data belonging to other users by manipulating object IDs in API requests.
    *   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server uses object IDs as primary identifiers for data records and exposes API endpoints that can be manipulated to access these records. Without proper authorization checks enforced through Parse Server's features (ACLs, CLPs), this vulnerability exists.
    *   **Example:** A user can change the `objectId` in a `GET` request for a `Post` object to view a post they are not authorized to see, exploiting the direct access to objects via their IDs provided by Parse Server.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, potential data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks in Cloud Code using Parse Server's security features (e.g., ACLs, CLP).
        *   Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in client-side code where possible.
        *   Use server-side logic (Cloud Code) to verify user permissions before returning or modifying data through Parse Server's API.

*   **NoSQL Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious NoSQL queries to bypass security checks, access sensitive data, or manipulate the database.
    *   **How Parse Server Contributes:** While Parse Server abstracts database interactions, vulnerabilities can arise from poorly written Cloud Code queries using `Parse.Query` or direct database access. Parse Server's query language, if used insecurely, can be a vector for NoSQL injection.
    *   **Example:** A Cloud Code function that constructs a `Parse.Query` based on unsanitized user input could be exploited to retrieve unintended data by manipulating the query logic through the input.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data access, potential data corruption or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries or Parse Server's built-in query methods that prevent direct SQL/NoSQL injection.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used in database queries within Cloud Code.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when interacting with the database through Parse Server's SDK.

*   **Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can set arbitrary fields on Parse Objects during creation or updates, potentially modifying sensitive fields they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server's API allows clients to send data for multiple fields during object creation or updates. If Class-Level Permissions (CLP) are not properly configured within Parse Server, clients can attempt to modify protected fields.
    *   **Example:** A user can include an `isAdmin: true` field in a request to create a new user, attempting to grant themselves administrative privileges by leveraging Parse Server's data modification capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Class-Level Permissions (CLP) within Parse Server to restrict which fields can be modified by different roles or users.
        *   Implement Cloud Code `beforeSave` triggers to sanitize input and prevent modification of sensitive fields before Parse Server persists the data.
        *   Explicitly define the allowed fields for creation and updates in your application logic and enforce this within Cloud Code.

*   **Code Injection in Cloud Functions**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into Cloud Functions that gets executed on the server.
    *   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Cloud Functions are a core feature of Parse Server, allowing developers to execute custom server-side logic. Vulnerabilities arise when external input is not properly handled within these functions, leading to potential code injection within the Parse Server environment.
    *   **Example:** A Cloud Function that executes shell commands based on user input without proper sanitization could allow an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Parse Server instance.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external input used in Cloud Functions.
        *   Avoid using dynamic code execution (e.g., `eval()`) with untrusted input within Cloud Functions.
        *   Follow secure coding practices for Node.js development when writing Cloud Functions.
        *   Implement proper input validation and output encoding within Cloud Functions.

*   **Insecure File Uploads**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can upload malicious files that could be executed on the server or served to other users.
    *   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server provides built-in functionality for storing files. If the application doesn't implement proper validation within Cloud Code or through Parse Server's configuration, malicious files can be uploaded and potentially exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image through Parse Server's file upload API, which can then be executed if the server is not properly configured.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS), denial of service, storage abuse.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate file types, sizes, and content on the server-side within Cloud Code before saving files using Parse Server's file storage.
        *   Store uploaded files in a non-executable directory configured within the server environment.
        *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with proper security configurations for serving uploaded files.
        *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files before they are stored by Parse Server.
        *   Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable URLs when using Parse Server's file storage.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through Webhooks**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can induce the Parse Server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    *   **How Parse Server Contributes:** Parse Server allows configuring webhooks that trigger HTTP requests to external URLs. If the application allows users to define these webhook URLs and doesn't validate them within Cloud Code, it creates an SSRF vulnerability through Parse Server's webhook functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker configures a webhook URL pointing to an internal service, causing the Parse Server to make a request to that service, potentially exposing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions within the network.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize webhook URLs provided by users within Cloud Code before configuring them in Parse Server.
        *   Implement allow-lists for permitted webhook destinations.
        *   Restrict the network access of the Parse Server instance.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided URLs in HTTP requests initiated by Parse Server's webhooks without validation.
