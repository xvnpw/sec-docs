# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by parse-server include:
- Application data management: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of application data.
- User authentication and authorization: Securely managing user identities and access permissions.
- API access control: Protecting the Parse Server API from unauthorized access and attacks.

Data being protected and its sensitivity:
- Application data: This can include various types of data depending on the application built on top of Parse Server. Sensitivity can range from low (public data) to high (personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, health records). The sensitivity level is highly dependent on the specific application's use case.
- User credentials: Usernames, passwords, and other authentication factors used to access applications. These are highly sensitive and require strong protection.
- API keys and secrets: Credentials used for accessing Parse Server API and integrating with external services. These are sensitive and need secure management.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the target company size and risk appetite? (Startup vs. Fortune 500). This will impact the prioritization of security controls and accepted risks.
- What are the compliance requirements for the application and data? (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS). Compliance requirements will dictate specific security controls and policies.
- What is the existing security infrastructure and expertise within the organization? This will influence the feasibility and implementation of recommended security controls.
- What is the expected scale and performance requirements for Parse Server? Scale and performance needs can impact deployment architecture and security considerations.

Assumptions:
- Parse Server is deployed in a cloud environment (AWS as example).
- The application built on Parse Server handles moderately sensitive user data.
- Security is a relevant concern, but rapid development and deployment are also important priorities.
- The organization has some level of technical expertise but may not have dedicated security specialists.
- The deployment architecture is a typical three-tier web application architecture.
