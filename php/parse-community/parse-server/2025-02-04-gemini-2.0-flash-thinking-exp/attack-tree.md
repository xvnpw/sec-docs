## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parse Server API Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parse_server_api_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **API Endpoint Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Unprotected or Misconfigured API Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Unauthenticated API Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker directly accesses API endpoints that lack proper authentication mechanisms.
            *   **Exploitation:** By sending HTTP requests to these endpoints without providing valid credentials (e.g., session tokens, API keys), the attacker can bypass authentication and perform unauthorized actions. This could include reading, modifying, or deleting data, or triggering administrative functions.
        *   **Misconfigured Permissions on Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** API endpoints have overly permissive access controls, allowing unauthorized users or roles to perform actions they should not be allowed to.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker leverages their existing (potentially low-privilege) credentials or even unauthenticated access to interact with endpoints where permissions are misconfigured. This allows them to escalate privileges and access or manipulate data beyond their intended authorization level.
    *   **Parameter Tampering & Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Query Parameter Manipulation (NoSQL Injection) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  API endpoints use query parameters to construct NoSQL queries (common with MongoDB used by Parse Server) without proper sanitization or parameterization.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker crafts malicious query parameters containing NoSQL injection payloads. When these parameters are used to build database queries, the injected code is executed by the database. This can allow the attacker to bypass security checks, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even perform denial-of-service attacks on the database.
    *   **Rate Limiting & Denial of Service (DoS):**
        *   **Lack of Rate Limiting [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** API endpoints are not protected by rate limiting mechanisms.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attacker sends a large volume of requests to API endpoints from a single or distributed source. This overwhelms the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, database connections), causing legitimate users to be unable to access the application or experience significant performance degradation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cloud Code Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cloud_code_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Cloud Code Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Vulnerable Cloud Code Logic [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Custom Cloud Code functions contain security vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices. This can include vulnerabilities like command injection, insecure data handling, use of vulnerable dependencies within Cloud Code, or logic flaws that allow unintended code execution.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities in the Cloud Code. For example, if Cloud Code takes user input and executes shell commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands to be executed on the server. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the Parse Server instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Cloud Code Permission Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Insecure Class-Level Permissions (CLP) in Cloud Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Class-Level Permissions (CLP) are misconfigured within Cloud Code, granting excessive or incorrect access rights to data classes.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker leverages these misconfigured CLPs to bypass intended access controls. For example, if a CLP incorrectly allows public read access to a sensitive data class, an attacker can directly query and retrieve this data without proper authorization, even if the API endpoints themselves are secured. This can lead to data breaches and unauthorized data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parse Server Configuration & Deployment Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parse_server_configuration_&_deployment_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Misconfiguration of Parse Server [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Insecure Default Settings [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Parse Server is deployed using default configurations that are not hardened for production environments. This can include using default API keys, weak or default Master Key (though less likely), insecure logging configurations, or leaving unnecessary features enabled.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker exploits the weaknesses introduced by default settings. For example, default API keys might be easily guessable or publicly known, allowing unauthorized access. Insecure logging might expose sensitive information that aids further attacks.
    *   **Exposed Configuration Files/Environment Variables [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Parse Server configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `.env` files) or environment variables containing sensitive information are inadvertently exposed or made accessible to unauthorized parties. This can happen due to misconfigured web servers, insecure file permissions, or improper secrets management practices.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker gains access to these exposed configuration files or environment variables. This can reveal critical secrets like database credentials, API keys, and most importantly, the Master Key. Compromise of the Master Key grants full administrative control over the Parse Server.
*   **Vulnerable Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Outdated Parse Server Version [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The deployed Parse Server instance is running an outdated version that contains known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker identifies the version of Parse Server being used (e.g., through server headers or error messages). If it's an outdated version, they can search for publicly known vulnerabilities and exploits for that specific version. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Vulnerable Node.js Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Parse Server relies on numerous Node.js dependencies. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, the Parse Server instance becomes vulnerable. This risk is amplified by the dynamic nature of the Node.js ecosystem and the potential for dependency confusion attacks.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker identifies vulnerable Node.js dependencies used by the Parse Server (e.g., through dependency scanning tools or known vulnerability databases). They then exploit these vulnerabilities. This could involve using publicly available exploits or developing custom exploits. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication & Authorization Weaknesses (Parse Server Specific) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_&_authorization_weaknesses__parse_server_specific___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Master Key Compromise [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Exposure of Master Key [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The Parse Server Master Key, which grants full administrative privileges, is exposed due to insecure storage, misconfiguration, or information leakage. This could be through exposed configuration files, environment variables, insecure logging, or even accidental disclosure in code or documentation.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attacker obtains the Master Key. With the Master Key, the attacker gains complete administrative control over the Parse Server. They can bypass all authentication and authorization checks, access and modify any data, create or delete users, modify Cloud Code, change server settings, and essentially take over the entire Parse Server instance and the application it supports. This is the most critical authentication vulnerability in Parse Server.
