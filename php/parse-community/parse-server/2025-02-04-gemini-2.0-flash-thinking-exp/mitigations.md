# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for parse-community/parse-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Parse Server Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_parse_server_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Parse Server Configuration:** Identify the configuration file where Parse Server options are defined (e.g., `index.js`, `parse-server-config.json`, environment variables).
    2.  **Disable Dashboard (Recommended) or Secure Dashboard (If Absolutely Necessary for Internal Use):** Configure the `dashboard` option in your Parse Server configuration.  Disable it in production or restrict access via IP whitelisting, strong authentication (`dashboard.users`), and ideally, VPN/internal network access.
    3.  **Review `allowClientClassCreation`:**  Set `allowClientClassCreation: false` in your `ParseServerOptions` if clients should not create new Parse Classes.
    4.  **Review `enableAnonymousUsers`:** Set `enableAnonymousUsers: false` in your `ParseServerOptions` if anonymous users are not required.
    5.  **Configure Default ACLs and CLPs:** Explicitly define default Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Class-Level Permissions (CLPs) within `ParseServerOptions` or through code for new classes and objects.
    6.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Review other `ParseServerOptions` and disable features not used by your application.
    7.  **Regularly Audit Settings:** Periodically review your Parse Server configuration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Backend Administration (High Severity): Via insecure Parse Dashboard.
        *   Unauthorized Schema Modifications (Medium Severity): If `allowClientClassCreation` is enabled unnecessarily.
        *   Abuse of Anonymous User Functionality (Medium Severity): If `enableAnonymousUsers` is enabled when not needed.
        *   Data Exposure due to Permissive Defaults (Medium Severity): Overly permissive default ACLs and CLPs.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Backend Administration (High Severity) - Impact: High
        *   Unauthorized Schema Modifications (Medium Severity) - Impact: Medium
        *   Abuse of Anonymous User Functionality (Medium Severity) - Impact: Medium
        *   Data Exposure due to Permissive Defaults (Medium Severity) - Impact: Medium

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Dashboard is disabled in production configuration. `allowClientClassCreation` is `false` in production and staging. `enableAnonymousUsers` is `false` in production. Default ACLs/CLPs partially configured.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** IP whitelisting/strong auth for staging dashboard. Comprehensive review and hardening of all `ParseServerOptions`. Refine default ACLs/CLPs to least privilege. Systematically review and disable unused features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control API Keys and Master Key Usage](./mitigation_strategies/control_api_keys_and_master_key_usage.md)

    3.  **Implement Key Rotation:**  Establish a process for periodically rotating API keys, especially Master Key and Client Keys.
    4.  **Secure Key Storage:** Store API keys and Master Key securely using environment variables, secure config management, or secrets management.
    5.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Keys:** Configure Client Keys/JavaScript Keys with minimum necessary permissions.
    6.  **Monitor Key Usage (Optional):** Implement logging/monitoring of API key usage, especially Master Key.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Master Key Compromise (Critical Severity): Full admin control if Master Key is compromised.
        *   Unauthorized Data Access and Modification (High Severity): Via compromised/misused API keys.
        *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity): Misuse of powerful keys.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Master Key Compromise (Critical Severity) - Impact: High
        *   Unauthorized Data Access and Modification (High Severity) - Impact: High
        *   Privilege Escalation (High Severity) - Impact: Medium

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Master Key in environment variables. Client Keys used in clients.
