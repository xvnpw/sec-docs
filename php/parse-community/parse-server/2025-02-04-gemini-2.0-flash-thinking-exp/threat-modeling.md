# Threat Model Analysis for parse-community/parse-server

## Threat: [Unprotected or Misconfigured API Endpoints](./threats/unprotected_or_misconfigured_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can directly access Parse Server API endpoints (e.g., `/classes`, `/users`, `/functions`) without proper authentication or authorization. They can enumerate data, modify data, create/delete users, or execute cloud functions without permission by sending direct HTTP requests.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, service disruption.
*   **Affected Parse Server Component:** REST API, Authentication module, Authorization module, Class-Level Permissions (CLP), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce authentication for all API endpoints.
    *   Implement and configure Class-Level Permissions (CLP) to restrict data access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing user roles and permissions.
    *   Regularly audit API endpoint configurations and permissions.

## Threat: [Insecure Cloud Code Execution](./threats/insecure_cloud_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in custom Cloud Code or insecure coding practices within Cloud Code to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Parse Server, gain access to sensitive data, or manipulate application logic. This can be done by injecting malicious code through input parameters or exploiting vulnerabilities in Cloud Code logic.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption, complete server compromise.
*   **Affected Parse Server Component:** Cloud Code module, JavaScript execution environment (Node.js), Server-side functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict code review processes for all Cloud Code.
    *   Enforce secure coding practices in Cloud Code (input validation, output encoding, avoid direct system calls).
    *   Utilize Parse Server's Cloud Code security features and limit permissions granted to Cloud Code functions.
    *   Implement robust logging and monitoring of Cloud Code execution.

    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for dashboard access.
    *   Restrict access to the dashboard to authorized users and networks (e.g., using IP whitelisting).
    *   Regularly audit dashboard user accounts and permissions.

## Threat: [Exposed API Keys and Application IDs](./threats/exposed_api_keys_and_application_ids.md)

*   **Description:** If Parse Server API keys (Master Key, Application ID, Client Key, JavaScript Key, REST API Key) are inadvertently exposed in client-side code, public repositories, logs, or other insecure locations, attackers can use these keys to bypass security controls and perform unauthorized actions. Exposure of the Master Key is especially critical.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized API access, data breaches, data manipulation, circumvention of security controls, potential administrative access if Master Key is exposed.
*   **Affected Parse Server Component:** API key management, Authentication module, Authorization module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (especially Master Key exposure)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely manage API keys.
    *   Never expose Master Key in client-side code.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management to store API keys.
    *   Rotate API keys periodically.
    *   Implement access controls based on API keys.

## Threat: [GraphQL API Vulnerabilities (if enabled)](./threats/graphql_api_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If GraphQL API is enabled, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities like introspection abuse to understand the data schema, craft complex queries to cause Denial of Service (DoS), or bypass authorization checks within GraphQL resolvers to access unauthorized data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (schema details), service disruption (DoS), unauthorized data access.
*   **Affected Parse Server Component:** GraphQL API module, GraphQL resolvers, Authentication module, Authorization module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable GraphQL introspection in production environments.
