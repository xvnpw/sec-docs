# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a Go library called `deepcopy` that provides functionality for performing deep copies of Go data structures. The primary business priority for a library like this is to ensure data integrity and prevent unintended side effects when copying complex objects. Developers use deep copy to create independent copies of data, ensuring modifications to the copy do not affect the original data.

The main business goal is to provide a reliable and efficient deep copy mechanism for Go developers, improving the robustness and predictability of Go applications.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:

- Risk of incorrect deep copy implementation: If the library fails to correctly deep copy objects, it can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior in applications relying on it. This can result in functional bugs, data loss, or security vulnerabilities in downstream applications.
- Risk of performance bottlenecks: Inefficient deep copy implementation can introduce performance overhead, especially when dealing with large or complex data structures. This can negatively impact the performance of applications using the library.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in the library itself: Although less likely for a pure utility library, vulnerabilities in the deep copy logic could potentially be exploited if the library is used to copy security-sensitive data structures.

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls

This is a library project, and based on the repository, there are no explicitly stated security controls documented. We can assume standard GitHub practices are in place for repository access control.

## Accepted Risks

Currently, there are no explicitly documented accepted security risks for this project.  For a library of this nature, the implicit accepted risks are typically related to the general security posture of open-source software, such as reliance on community contributions and the inherent risks of using external dependencies.

## Recommended Security Controls

To enhance the security posture of the `deepcopy` library, the following security controls are recommended:

- security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) during the build process to automatically identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in external dependencies, although this library appears to have no external dependencies.
- security control: Establish a process for security vulnerability reporting and patching. This includes defining a security policy and communication channels for reporting vulnerabilities.
- security control: Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on security aspects and best practices, in addition to functional correctness.
- security control: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests, including test cases specifically designed to cover edge cases and potential security-relevant scenarios, such as copying objects containing pointers or sensitive data.

## Security Requirements

The following security requirements are important for the `deepcopy` library:

- Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Authentication is relevant for systems that manage access to the library's repository (e.g., GitHub).
- Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Authorization is relevant for systems that manage access to the library's repository (e.g., GitHub).
- Input Validation: While the library itself doesn't directly handle external user input, it processes Go data structures provided by the calling application. The library should be robust in handling various types of Go objects and avoid panics or unexpected behavior when encountering unusual or maliciously crafted objects. Input validation in the context of this library means ensuring the deep copy logic correctly handles all valid Go data structures without crashing or corrupting data.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for the `deepcopy` library itself. However, if the library is used in applications that handle sensitive data and require deep copying of cryptographic keys or sensitive information, it's crucial to ensure the deep copy process does not inadvertently expose or mishandle this sensitive data. The library should not introduce any cryptographic vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Critical Business Processes

The critical business processes that rely on the `deepcopy` library are those within Go applications that use it for data management and manipulation. These processes depend on the library's ability to create accurate and independent copies of data structures. Incorrect deep copies can lead to data corruption, logical errors, and potentially security vulnerabilities in these applications.

Examples of critical business processes could include:

- Data replication and backup processes.
- Session management and state handling in web applications.
- Data transformation and processing pipelines.
- Security-sensitive operations that require isolation of data.

## Data Sensitivity

The sensitivity of the data being protected depends entirely on the applications that use the `deepcopy` library. The library itself is data-agnostic. If an application uses `deepcopy` to copy sensitive data, such as user credentials, personal information, or financial data, then that data becomes the data being protected in the context of using this library.

The sensitivity level can range from low (publicly available data) to high (highly confidential or regulated data), depending on the application's purpose and the data it handles. It is the responsibility of the applications using `deepcopy` to ensure they handle sensitive data appropriately, including when using deep copy operations.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

## Questions

- What types of applications are intended to use this `deepcopy` library most frequently? Understanding the typical use cases will help prioritize security considerations.
- Are there any specific performance requirements for deep copy operations in the intended use cases? Performance considerations can sometimes influence design and security choices.
- Are there any known security vulnerabilities or concerns related to deep copy operations in Go in general that should be considered for this library?
- What is the expected level of security assurance required for applications using this library? Is it for general-purpose use, or are there scenarios involving high-security environments?

## Assumptions

- BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that the primary business goal is to provide a reliable and performant deep copy library for general Go development use. Data integrity and correctness are paramount.
- SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that while explicit security measures are not currently in place, there is a desire to improve the security posture of the library through recommended security controls. The library is intended for use in a variety of applications, some of which may handle sensitive data.
- DESIGN: It is assumed that the current design is relatively simple, focused on providing core deep copy functionality. The library is intended to be used as a dependency in other Go projects and is not deployed as a standalone service. The build process is assumed to be based on standard Go tooling and can be enhanced with CI/CD and security checks.
