# Threat Model Analysis for myclabs/deepcopy

## Threat: [Object Injection via Malicious Payloads](./threats/object_injection_via_malicious_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted data (e.g., serialized strings) that, when deep copied, instantiates unexpected classes or triggers magic methods (`__wakeup`, `__set_state`, etc.) with harmful side effects. The attacker manipulates the structure and content of the data being deep copied.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, arbitrary code execution within the application context, data corruption, or denial of service depending on the instantiated class and its actions.

**Affected Component:** Core deep copy logic, specifically the handling of object instantiation and property assignment during the copying process.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Avoid deep copying data originating from untrusted sources directly.
* Sanitize and validate data before deep copying.
* Implement whitelisting of allowed classes if deep copying user-provided data is unavoidable.
* Consider using alternative serialization/deserialization methods with stricter controls.
* Regularly audit the application's codebase for instances where untrusted data is deep copied.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Deeply Nested Objects](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_deeply_nested_objects.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input that leads to the deep copying of extremely large or deeply nested object structures. The `deepcopy` function recursively traverses these structures, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) by exhausting server resources, leading to application crashes or unresponsiveness.

**Affected Component:** The recursive traversal logic within the core deep copy function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement limits on the depth and size of objects allowed to be deep copied.
* Implement timeouts for deep copy operations.
* Monitor resource usage during deep copy operations and implement alerts for excessive consumption.
* Consider alternative copying strategies for very large objects if deep copying is not strictly necessary.
