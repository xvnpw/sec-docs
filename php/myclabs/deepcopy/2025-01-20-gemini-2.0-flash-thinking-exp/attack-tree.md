## Attack Tree Path: [Influence Application State/Logic via Manipulated Deep Copy (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/influence_application_statelogic_via_manipulated_deep_copy__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker aims to alter the application's internal state or logic by manipulating the object being deep copied. This can involve modifying attributes, introducing malicious objects, or exploiting type confusion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Magic Methods (__setstate__, __wakeup__, etc.) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_magic_methods____setstate______wakeup____etc____critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application deep copies objects that implement magic methods like `__setstate__` or `__wakeup__`, an attacker can craft malicious objects where these methods perform unintended actions during the deep copy process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires application to deserialize copied object unsafely)
*   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary code execution, full compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires crafting malicious serialized data)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (Understanding of serialization vulnerabilities)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring deserialization processes and patterns)

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Unsafe Deserialization (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_unsafe_deserialization__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** A specific instance of exploiting magic methods where the attacker injects malicious serialized data. When the `__setstate__` or `__wakeup__` method is invoked during deep copy, this data is deserialized, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Resource Exhaustion (e.g., infinite loops) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_resource_exhaustion__e_g___infinite_loops___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects specially crafted objects into the data structure being deep copied. These objects are designed to cause infinite loops or excessive resource consumption when the deep copy algorithm attempts to copy them.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on how the application handles copied objects)
*   **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Crafting objects with circular references or complex structures)
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Basic understanding of object structures)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (High CPU/memory usage can be monitored)

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Circular References (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_circular_references__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides data structures with complex or malicious circular references. This can cause the deep copy algorithm to enter an infinite recursion, leading to a stack overflow and application crash, or exhaust server resources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Infinite Recursion/Stack Overflow during Deep Copy (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_infinite_recursionstack_overflow_during_deep_copy__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The direct consequence of manipulating circular references, leading to the deep copy function exceeding recursion limits and crashing the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Deep Copy (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__via_deep_copy__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker aims to make the application unavailable by overwhelming its resources through the deep copy mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Extremely Large or Deeply Nested Objects (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_extremely_large_or_deeply_nested_objects__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides extremely large or deeply nested objects as input to the deep copy function. This can exhaust server memory or cause excessive CPU usage, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Easy to generate large data structures)
*   **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple to create large data)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of data size)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (High memory usage, application crashes)
