# Attack Surface Analysis for myclabs/deepcopy

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Magic Method Invocation](./attack_surfaces/unintended_magic_method_invocation.md)

**Description:** Deepcopy can trigger PHP's magic methods (e.g., `__wakeup`, `__destruct`, `__clone`) on objects being copied. If these methods contain vulnerabilities or perform unintended actions, deepcopying a crafted object can trigger them.
* **How deepcopy contributes to the attack surface:** Deepcopy's core functionality involves creating new instances of objects and copying their properties. This process can inherently invoke magic methods defined in the object's class.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts an object where the `__wakeup` method executes arbitrary code based on a property value. When this object is deep copied, the `__wakeup` method is invoked, leading to code execution.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data manipulation.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly audit and sanitize the logic within all magic methods of classes that might be deep copied.
    * Avoid performing critical or unsafe operations within magic methods.
    * Limit the deep copying of objects originating from untrusted sources.
