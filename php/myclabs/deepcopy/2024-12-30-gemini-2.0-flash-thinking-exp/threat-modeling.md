Here's the updated list of high and critical threats directly involving the `myclabs/deepcopy` library:

*   **Threat:** Object State Corruption via Malicious `__clone()`
    *   **Description:** An attacker could influence the creation of objects that are later deep copied. If these objects have a custom `__clone()` method with malicious logic, the `DeepCopy::copy()` process will execute this logic, potentially corrupting the state of the newly created copy in an unintended way. The attacker might manipulate input data or exploit other vulnerabilities to ensure objects with malicious `__clone()` methods are part of the object graph being deep copied.
    *   **Impact:** The copied object will have an incorrect or compromised state, leading to unexpected application behavior, data inconsistencies, or potentially further security vulnerabilities if the corrupted object is used in critical operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core deep copy logic within `DeepCopy::copy()` and the handling of objects with `__clone()` methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and audit all custom `__clone()` methods within the application's codebase.
        *   Ensure that `__clone()` methods only perform the intended cloning logic and do not have any unintended side effects or vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using immutable objects where possible to reduce the need for deep copying and the risk of state corruption.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent the creation of objects with malicious `__clone()` methods in the first place.

*   **Threat:** Unintended Disclosure of Sensitive Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker might be able to observe or access the memory or storage where deep copies are created. If objects containing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) are deep copied by `DeepCopy::copy()`, this sensitive data could be exposed in the copied object, even if the original object is later destroyed or its sensitive properties are unset. The attacker could exploit memory dumps, logging mechanisms, or temporary file storage to access these copies.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential information is leaked, potentially leading to identity theft, unauthorized access, or other security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core deep copy logic within `DeepCopy::copy()` and the handling of object properties.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deep copying objects that contain sensitive information directly.
        *   Sanitize or exclude sensitive properties from the deep copy process using the `$skipProperties` feature of `DeepCopy` or custom cloning logic.
        *   Consider using dedicated secret management solutions instead of storing sensitive data directly within application objects.
        *   Ensure that temporary storage or memory used during the deep copy process is securely managed and cleared.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Recursive Copying
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft an object graph with circular references or extremely deep nesting. When the application attempts to deep copy this structure using `DeepCopy::copy()`, the function might enter an infinite loop or consume excessive memory and CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. The attacker could exploit input mechanisms or vulnerabilities in data processing to introduce such malicious object graphs.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core deep copy logic within `DeepCopy::copy()` and its handling of object references.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement safeguards to prevent or limit the depth of recursion during deep copying. This could involve setting a maximum recursion depth or implementing cycle detection mechanisms within the application's usage of `DeepCopy`.
        *   Validate and sanitize input data to prevent the creation of excessively nested or circular object structures.
        *   Implement timeouts or resource limits for deep copy operations to prevent them from consuming excessive resources.
