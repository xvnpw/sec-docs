* **Resource Exhaustion through Deeply Nested or Circular Objects:**
    * **Description:** Deep copying complex object graphs, especially those with deep nesting or circular references, can consume significant memory and CPU resources. An attacker controlling the structure of the object being copied could exploit this to cause a denial-of-service (DoS).
    * **How `deepcopy` Contributes:** `deepcopy` recursively traverses the object graph to create a complete copy. This traversal can become computationally expensive with complex structures.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides data that, when instantiated into an object, creates a deeply nested structure or a circular reference. Deep copying this object could lead to excessive memory allocation and processing time, potentially crashing the application.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown, resource exhaustion.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement limits on the depth or complexity of objects that can be deep copied.
        * Sanitize or validate input data used to create objects before deep copying.
        * Monitor resource usage during deep copy operations.
        * Consider alternative approaches for handling complex object structures if deep copying is a performance bottleneck.

* **Indirect Object Injection via Deep Copied Properties:**
    * **Description:** While `deepcopy` itself doesn't directly perform unserialization, if the objects being deep copied contain properties that are later used in a context where they *are* unserialized (e.g., stored in a session, passed to a function that unserializes), vulnerabilities related to object injection could arise. The deep copy process preserves the potentially malicious object structure.
    * **How `deepcopy` Contributes:** `deepcopy` faithfully replicates the structure and properties of the original object, including potentially malicious serialized data within its properties.
    * **Example:** An object containing a property with a serialized payload designed for object injection is deep copied. Later, this deep copied object is stored in a session, and when the session is unserialized, the malicious payload is executed.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, arbitrary code execution, data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid storing potentially untrusted data in object properties that will be deep copied and later unserialized.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization before data is used to create objects.
        * Use secure serialization/unserialization practices and consider alternatives to PHP's native `unserialize`.
        * Regularly audit code that handles serialization and unserialization of deep copied objects.

* **Bypass of Security Measures through Cloning:**
    * **Description:** If security checks or sanitization are performed on an object before it's used, deep copying that object might create a copy that bypasses these checks. The cloned object might not have undergone the same security procedures as the original.
    * **How `deepcopy` Contributes:** `deepcopy` creates a new, independent instance of the object, potentially circumventing security measures applied to the original object.
    * **Example:** An object containing user input is sanitized to prevent XSS. If this object is deep copied, the cloned object might not have undergone the same sanitization, and if used in a vulnerable context, could lead to XSS.
    * **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, potential for various attacks depending on the bypassed measure (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure security checks are applied consistently, even after deep copying.
        * Avoid relying solely on object-level sanitization if the object can be easily cloned.
        * Consider if the need for deep copying can be avoided in security-sensitive contexts.
