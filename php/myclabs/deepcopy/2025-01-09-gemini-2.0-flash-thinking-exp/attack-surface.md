# Attack Surface Analysis for myclabs/deepcopy

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service via Deeply Nested Objects)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_via_deeply_nested_objects_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides an input object with an extremely deep level of nesting.
    * **How `deepcopy` Contributes:** `deepcopy` recursively traverses the object structure. Excessive nesting leads to a very large number of recursive calls, potentially exceeding Python's recursion depth limit and causing a `RecursionError` (stack overflow), effectively crashing the application.
    * **Example:**
        ```python
        class Nested:
            def __init__(self, next_level=None):
                self.next = next_level

        deeply_nested = Nested()
        current = deeply_nested
        for _ in range(10000): # Create a very deep structure
            current.next = Nested()
            current = current.next

        from copy import deepcopy
        deepcopy(deeply_nested) # This could cause a RecursionError
        ```
    * **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:** Implement checks on the depth or complexity of input objects before attempting to deep copy them. Reject objects exceeding a reasonable threshold.
        * **Recursion Depth Limits:** Consider using `sys.setrecursionlimit()` to increase the recursion limit, but be aware of potential memory implications. A better approach is to avoid deep copying excessively nested structures in the first place.
        * **Iterative Copying (if feasible):** For certain data structures, it might be possible to implement an iterative copying mechanism instead of relying on recursion.

## Attack Surface: [Code Execution via Malicious `__reduce__` or `__setstate__`](./attack_surfaces/code_execution_via_malicious____reduce____or____setstate___.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts an object with a malicious implementation of the `__reduce__` or `__setstate__` magic methods.
    * **How `deepcopy` Contributes:** `deepcopy` relies on the `__reduce__` method to get information about how to serialize an object and potentially on `__setstate__` to restore its state. If these methods are maliciously crafted, they can execute arbitrary code during the deep copy process. This is akin to deserialization vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:**
        ```python
        import os

        class Malicious:
            def __reduce__(self):
                return (os.system, ("touch /tmp/pwned",))

        evil_obj = Malicious()

        from copy import deepcopy
        deepcopy(evil_obj) # Upon deepcopy, the command will be executed
        ```
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or within the application's context.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never Deep Copy Untrusted Input Directly:** Avoid deep copying objects received from external sources or untrusted environments without thorough sanitization.
        * **Restrict Usage of `deepcopy` on External Data:** Limit the use of `deepcopy` to internal application objects where the structure and behavior are well-defined and trusted.
        * **Consider Alternatives to `deepcopy`:** For data from external sources, consider using safer serialization/deserialization methods or manual object reconstruction.
        * **Security Audits:** Regularly audit the codebase to identify places where `deepcopy` is used on potentially untrusted data.
