# Threat Model Analysis for myclabs/deepcopy

## Threat: [Deeply Nested Object Exhaustion](./threats/deeply_nested_object_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides or manipulates data that, when processed by `DeepCopy::copy()`, results in an extremely deeply nested object structure. The recursive nature of the deep copy operation can lead to stack overflow errors or excessive memory consumption *within the library's execution*.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion *caused by the deep copy operation*.

**Affected Component:** The recursive logic within the `DeepCopy::copy()` method.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* While direct mitigation within the library's usage is key, consider if the library itself could benefit from internal safeguards against excessive recursion depth (this is more for library maintainers).
* Implement input validation *before* passing data to `DeepCopy::copy()` to limit nesting.

## Threat: [Circular Reference Loop](./threats/circular_reference_loop.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an object graph containing circular references to `DeepCopy::copy()`. The library's logic for handling references might enter an infinite loop trying to copy this structure, consuming excessive CPU and memory *during the deep copy process*.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion *during the deep copy operation*.

**Affected Component:** The reference handling logic within the `DeepCopy::copy()` method.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ideally, the `deepcopy` library itself should have robust cycle detection mechanisms. If not present, consider contributing or requesting this feature from the library maintainers.
* Validate input data to prevent the introduction of circular references *before* deep copying.

## Threat: [Unintended Side Effects via Magic Methods](./threats/unintended_side_effects_via_magic_methods.md)

**Description:** If objects passed to `DeepCopy::copy()` have magic methods like `__clone` that perform actions with side effects (e.g., database writes), the deep copy process will invoke these methods. An attacker could craft objects specifically to trigger harmful side effects *during the deep copy operation*.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities depending on the side effects triggered by the library's invocation of magic methods.

**Affected Component:** The library's handling of object cloning and the invocation of magic methods during the `DeepCopy::copy()` process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Be extremely cautious about deep copying objects with known side effects in their magic methods.
* Document clearly which object types are safe to deep copy and which are not.
* Consider if the library could offer options to control the invocation of magic methods during deep copy (more for library maintainers).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `deepcopy` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__deepcopy__library_itself.md)

**Description:** The `myclabs/deepcopy` library's code might contain inherent security vulnerabilities (e.g., memory corruption bugs, logic errors in handling specific object types) that an attacker could exploit by crafting specific objects to be deep copied.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service *within the context of the deep copy operation*.

**Affected Component:** Various parts of the `myclabs/deepcopy` library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `myclabs/deepcopy` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with the library.
* Consider using static analysis tools on your own codebase to identify potential areas where using `deepcopy` might interact with vulnerable object structures.
* If feasible, contribute to the library by reporting potential vulnerabilities or submitting patches.
