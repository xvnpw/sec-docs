### 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Resource Monitoring and Throttling for Deepcopy Operations

This section provides a detailed analysis of each component of the proposed mitigation strategy.

#### 4.1. Instrument `deepcopy` Calls

*   **Description:**  Wrapping all calls to `myclabs/deepcopy` with monitoring code to track resource usage (CPU time, memory allocation, execution time) specifically for these operations.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Purpose:** This is the foundational step, providing the necessary data to understand the resource consumption of `deepcopy` operations. Without instrumentation, monitoring and throttling are impossible to implement effectively for `deepcopy` specifically.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   **Code Modification:** Requires modifying the application code to intercept calls to `deepcopy`. This could involve:
            *   **Decorator/Wrapper Function:** Creating a wrapper function that calls the original `deepcopy` and adds monitoring logic before and after the call. This is a clean and maintainable approach.
            *   **Monkey Patching (Less Recommended):**  Dynamically replacing the `deepcopy` function with a monitored version. This can be more complex to manage and potentially less robust.
        *   **Resource Tracking:**  Utilize system libraries or profiling tools to measure:
            *   **CPU Time:**  Measure the CPU time spent executing the `deepcopy` function.
            *   **Memory Allocation:** Track the amount of memory allocated during the `deepcopy` operation. This can be challenging to isolate precisely to `deepcopy` but approximations are possible.
            *   **Execution Time (Latency):** Measure the wall-clock time taken for each `deepcopy` call.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Granular Visibility:** Provides specific data on `deepcopy` resource usage, enabling targeted mitigation.
