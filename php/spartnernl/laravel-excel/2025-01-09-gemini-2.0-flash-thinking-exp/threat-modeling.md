# Threat Model Analysis for spartnernl/laravel-excel

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted Excel file that exploits vulnerabilities in the underlying PHPExcel/PhpSpreadsheet library *as it is being processed by `laravel-excel`*. This could involve exploiting parsing flaws within the package's reader implementation to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Maatwebsite\Excel\Readers\LaravelExcelReader` (or similar reader classes), which orchestrates the use of the underlying PHPExcel/PhpSpreadsheet library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `laravel-excel` and its underlying dependencies (PHPExcel/PhpSpreadsheet) updated to the latest versions.
        *   Implement strict file type validation and size limits on file uploads *before* passing the file to `laravel-excel`.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for processing uploaded files *by `laravel-excel`*.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_file_upload_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads an excessively large or deeply nested Excel file that consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) *during the parsing process initiated by `laravel-excel`*, leading to application slowdown or complete unavailability.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, disrupting services for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Maatwebsite\Excel\Readers\LaravelExcelReader` (or similar reader classes), which manages the parsing process using the underlying library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement file size limits on uploads *before* processing with `laravel-excel`.
        *   Implement timeouts for file processing operations *within the `laravel-excel` processing logic*.
        *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Consider using asynchronous processing for file uploads processed by `laravel-excel`.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted XLSX file containing malicious external entity references. When parsed *by the underlying XML parsing functionality used by `laravel-excel`*, it could lead to the server accessing local files, internal network resources, or external resources, potentially disclosing sensitive information or performing Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (access to local files), SSRF leading to further attacks on internal systems, potential DoS.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying XML parsing functionality within PHPExcel/PhpSpreadsheet *as utilized by `laravel-excel`*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the underlying XML parser is configured to disable processing of external entities. This might require specific configuration within PHPExcel/PhpSpreadsheet (if configurable) or updating to versions where this is the default or has security patches.
        *   Sanitize or validate the content of the uploaded XLSX files *before processing with `laravel-excel`*.
