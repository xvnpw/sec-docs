# Attack Surface Analysis for spartnernl/laravel-excel

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads (Import)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads__import_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted spreadsheet file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing process of the underlying spreadsheet library used by `laravel-excel`.
*   **How laravel-excel Contributes:** `laravel-excel` provides the primary mechanism for handling and parsing uploaded Excel files (XLS, XLSX, CSV, etc.) within the application. It directly utilizes PHPSpreadsheet for this functionality, making it the entry point for such attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads an XLSX file containing a formula that, when processed by PHPSpreadsheet (through `laravel-excel`), leads to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate file extensions and MIME types on the server-side *before* passing the file to `laravel-excel` for processing.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `laravel-excel` and its underlying dependency PHPSpreadsheet updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Process file uploads in an isolated environment (e.g., using containers or sandboxed processes) *before* further integration with the application, limiting the impact if `laravel-excel`'s parsing is exploited.
    *   **File Size Limits:** Implement reasonable file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks through excessively large uploads processed by `laravel-excel`.
    *   **Virus Scanning:** Integrate virus scanning of uploaded files *before* they are handled by `laravel-excel`.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Import)](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__import_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts an Excel file (specifically formats like XLSX that use XML) containing malicious external entity declarations that can be exploited by the XML parser used by PHPSpreadsheet, which is integrated with `laravel-excel`.
*   **How laravel-excel Contributes:** `laravel-excel`, by using PHPSpreadsheet to parse XLSX files, relies on PHPSpreadsheet's XML parsing capabilities. If PHPSpreadsheet has an XXE vulnerability, `laravel-excel` directly exposes this attack surface to the application.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads an XLSX file with an external entity declaration that, when parsed by PHPSpreadsheet (through `laravel-excel`), allows the attacker to read local files on the server.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading local files, internal network resources), denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable External Entities:** Configure the underlying XML parser within PHPSpreadsheet (if configurable through `laravel-excel`'s options or PHPSpreadsheet's configuration) to disable the processing of external entities.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `laravel-excel` and PHPSpreadsheet updated to benefit from any patches addressing XXE vulnerabilities in the XML parsing component.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Exported Data](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_exported_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive or confidential information is unintentionally included in Excel files generated and exported using `laravel-excel`, potentially exposing it to unauthorized users.
*   **How laravel-excel Contributes:** `laravel-excel` is the direct mechanism used within the application to generate and format the data into Excel files for export. If the data provided to `laravel-excel` for export is not properly sanitized or filtered, sensitive information can be included in the output.
*   **Example:** An export intended for public consumption, generated using `laravel-excel`, inadvertently includes columns with customer social security numbers or internal financial data because the application logic didn't filter this data before passing it to `laravel-excel` for export.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Filtering and Selection:** Carefully select and filter the data *before* passing it to `laravel-excel` for export. Only include necessary information.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement proper access controls at the application level to ensure only authorized users can trigger the export functionality provided by `laravel-excel` and download the generated files.
    *   **Data Masking/Anonymization:** Consider masking or anonymizing sensitive data in the application *before* it's used by `laravel-excel` to generate export files when full disclosure is not required.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the data being passed to `laravel-excel` for export to ensure compliance with data privacy policies.
