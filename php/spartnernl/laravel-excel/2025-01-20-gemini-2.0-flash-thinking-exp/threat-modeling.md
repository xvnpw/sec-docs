# Threat Model Analysis for spartnernl/laravel-excel

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload - Formula Injection](./threats/malicious_file_upload_-_formula_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted Excel file. The `laravel-excel` package, through its `import()` method, processes this file. The malicious file contains Excel formulas (e.g., using `HYPERLINK`, `WEBSERVICE`, or `COMMAND`) that could be executed either during the server-side processing by `laravel-excel` or when a user downloads and opens the exported file. This execution can lead to remote code execution on the server or on the user's machine.

**Impact:**

*   Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.
*   Data exfiltration by sending data to an attacker-controlled server.
*   Malware infection on the user's machine if the exported file is opened.

**Affected Component:**

*   `import()` method for processing uploaded files.
*   `export()` methods if unsanitized data is included in formulas during export.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload - Macro Execution](./threats/malicious_file_upload_-_macro_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads an Excel file. The `laravel-excel` package's `import()` method processes this file. The file contains malicious VBA macros. If the server-side processing environment allows macro execution or a user opens the downloaded file with macros enabled, these macros could execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:**

*   Remote code execution on the server if the processing environment allows macro execution.
*   Malware infection, data theft, or system compromise on a user's machine if they open the downloaded file with macros enabled.

**Affected Component:**

*   `import()` method for processing uploaded files.
*   `export()` methods if the application allows embedding macros in exported files.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large or Complex Files](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_or_complex_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads an extremely large or computationally complex Excel file. The `laravel-excel` package's `import()` or `load()` methods attempt to parse and process this file. This processing consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:**

*   Application slowdown or unresponsiveness due to resource exhaustion.
*   Server resource exhaustion, potentially affecting other applications on the same server.
*   Application crashes due to memory limits or timeouts.

**Affected Component:**

*   `import()` and `load()` methods responsible for parsing and processing Excel files.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Path Traversal during Export](./threats/path_traversal_during_export.md)

**Description:** The application uses `laravel-excel`'s `store()` or `download()` methods to export files. If the application allows users to specify the filename or path for exported Excel files and this input is not properly sanitized before being used by `laravel-excel`, an attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the output path.

**Impact:**

*   Overwriting critical system files, leading to application malfunction or server compromise.
*   Overwriting other user's exported files, potentially causing data loss or corruption.

**Affected Component:**

*   `store()` or `download()` methods when handling user-provided output paths or filenames.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exposure of Temporary Files](./threats/exposure_of_temporary_files.md)

**Description:** The `laravel-excel` package might create temporary files during the import or export process. If these temporary files are stored in publicly accessible locations or are not deleted promptly after processing by `laravel-excel`, they could be accessed by unauthorized users.

**Impact:**

*   Exposure of sensitive data contained within the temporary files.

**Affected Component:**

*   File handling mechanisms within `laravel-excel` during import and export operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Data Injection during Export](./threats/data_injection_during_export.md)

**Description:** When using `laravel-excel`'s `export()` methods, if the data being exported to Excel is not properly sanitized by the application before being passed to `laravel-excel`, an attacker who controls this data could inject malicious content (e.g., formula injection payloads) into the exported file.

**Impact:**

*   Malicious formulas embedded in the exported file could be executed when a user opens the file, potentially compromising their machine.

**Affected Component:**

*   `export()` methods and the process of writing data to the Excel file within `laravel-excel`.

**Risk Severity:** High
