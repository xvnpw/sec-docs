## Attack Tree Path: [Event Loop Starvation](./attack_tree_paths/event_loop_starvation.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a large number of events or tasks to the ReactPHP application, overwhelming the event loop. This prevents the event loop from processing legitimate requests and tasks, effectively causing a denial-of-service. The application becomes unresponsive to users.

**Why High Risk:** This attack is relatively easy to execute with minimal resources and technical skill. The impact is significant, leading to a complete disruption of the application's functionality. Detection can be challenging as it might resemble legitimate high traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Request Smuggling (if using ReactPHP HTTP server)](./attack_tree_paths/http_request_smuggling__if_using_reactphp_http_server_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests that exploit discrepancies in how the ReactPHP HTTP server and backend systems interpret the request boundaries (e.g., Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers). This allows the attacker to "smuggle" additional requests within a single HTTP connection. These smuggled requests can bypass security controls, inject malicious data, or hijack user sessions.

**Why High Risk:** This attack can lead to severe security breaches, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms. It is notoriously difficult to detect as the malicious activity is hidden within seemingly legitimate HTTP traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Race Conditions](./attack_tree_paths/race_conditions.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Due to the asynchronous nature of ReactPHP, multiple operations might access and modify shared resources concurrently. A race condition occurs when the outcome of the application depends on the unpredictable order in which these operations execute. Attackers can manipulate the timing of these operations to force the application into an unintended and potentially vulnerable state, leading to data corruption, inconsistent states, or security bypasses.

**Why High Risk:** Race conditions are subtle and often difficult to identify and reproduce. Exploiting them requires a good understanding of the application's internal workings and timing. However, successful exploitation can lead to significant data integrity issues and security vulnerabilities that are hard to trace.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection (if application uses child processes via ReactPHP)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__if_application_uses_child_processes_via_reactphp_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses ReactPHP to execute external commands via child processes and incorporates user-controlled data into these commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. These injected commands will be executed on the server with the privileges of the application, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control of the system.

**Why High Risk:** This attack has a critical impact, potentially leading to complete system compromise. While the likelihood depends on how child processes are handled, the potential consequences are severe.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies (Specific to ReactPHP's internal dependencies)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies__specific_to_reactphp's_internal_dependencies_.md)

**Attack Vector:** ReactPHP relies on various internal libraries and dependencies. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise the application. This could involve leveraging known exploits for specific versions of the libraries.

**Why High Risk:** While the likelihood of a specific vulnerability being present at a given time is lower, the impact can be significant, ranging from denial-of-service to remote code execution. Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities often requires specialized knowledge and tools, but the potential damage justifies its high-risk classification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise ReactPHP Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_reactphp_application.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and therefore the most critical node. Success at this level signifies a complete breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Loop Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_loop_weaknesses.md)

The event loop is the core of ReactPHP's functionality. Compromising it allows attackers to disrupt the entire application's operation, control its execution flow, and potentially execute arbitrary code within the event loop context. Multiple high-risk paths, such as event loop starvation, originate from this critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Networking Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_networking_components.md)

This node represents the entry point for external attacks targeting the application's communication channels. Vulnerabilities in networking components can allow attackers to intercept, manipulate, and inject malicious data, leading to various high-risk scenarios like HTTP request smuggling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asynchronous Nature](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asynchronous_nature.md)

The inherent complexity of asynchronous programming in ReactPHP makes this a critical node. It's the source of subtle but potentially dangerous vulnerabilities like race conditions, which are difficult to detect and can have significant impact on data integrity and application security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Process Management (if application uses child processes via ReactPHP)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_process_management__if_application_uses_child_processes_via_reactphp_.md)

If the application utilizes child processes, this becomes a critical node because it directly exposes the application to the high-risk of command injection. Successful exploitation at this node can lead to complete server compromise.
