# Attack Surface Analysis for reactphp/reactphp

## Attack Surface: [Event Loop Blocking](./attack_surfaces/event_loop_blocking.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Event Loop Blocking
    *   **Description:** A single blocking operation within the ReactPHP event loop can halt the processing of all other events, leading to application unresponsiveness.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP's core is the event loop. Any synchronous, long-running operation within an event handler directly blocks this loop, affecting all concurrent operations.
    *   **Example:**  A developer performs a synchronous file read operation using standard PHP functions (e.g., `file_get_contents()`) within a request handler in a ReactPHP HTTP server. If this file read takes a significant amount of time, all other incoming requests will be delayed until the file read completes.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness, degraded user experience.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Asynchronous Operations: Employ ReactPHP's asynchronous APIs for I/O operations (e.g., `React\Filesystem\Filesystem` for file operations, non-blocking network requests).
        *   Offload Blocking Tasks: Move CPU-intensive or blocking tasks to separate processes or threads using libraries like `react/child-process` or extensions like `parallel`.
        *   Set Timeouts: Implement timeouts for operations that might potentially block to prevent indefinite hangs.
        *   Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and address potential blocking operations.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input in Network Handlers](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_in_network_handlers.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Unvalidated Input in Network Handlers
    *   **Description:**  Failing to properly sanitize and validate data received from network connections (e.g., HTTP requests, WebSocket messages) can lead to various injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP provides the infrastructure for handling network communication. If developers don't implement proper input validation within their request/message handlers, the application is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An HTTP server built with ReactPHP receives a POST request with a `User-Agent` header. The application directly uses this header value in a shell command executed using `react/child-process` without sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious commands within the `User-Agent` header.
    *   **Impact:** Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (if outputting to a web context without escaping), SQL Injection (if used in database queries), other injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Sanitization and Validation: Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input received from network connections before using it in application logic. Use appropriate escaping functions for the context (e.g., HTML escaping, shell escaping).
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run child processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.
        *   Parameterized Queries: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Connection Flooding](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_connection_flooding.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Resource Exhaustion through Connection Flooding
    *   **Description:**  An attacker can overwhelm the application by opening a large number of connections, exhausting server resources like memory and file descriptors.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP's non-blocking I/O model can handle many concurrent connections, but without proper limits, it's still susceptible to resource exhaustion from a flood of connections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of TCP connection requests to a ReactPHP-based server. If the server doesn't have connection limits or proper handling for excessive connections, it can run out of resources and become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unavailability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Connection Limits: Implement limits on the number of concurrent connections the server will accept.
        *   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of connection attempts or requests from a single IP address within a given timeframe.
        *   Resource Monitoring: Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors) to detect and respond to potential attacks.
        *   Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple server instances to mitigate the impact of a single server being overwhelmed.

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Process Execution via `react/child-process`](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_process_execution_via__reactchild-process_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Uncontrolled Process Execution via `react/child-process`
    *   **Description:**  If the application allows external influence over which processes are executed using `react/child-process`, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** The `react/child-process` component provides the functionality to execute external processes. If the arguments or the command itself are derived from untrusted input without proper validation, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A web application built with ReactPHP allows users to specify a program to run via a form input. This input is directly passed to `Process::command()` without any validation. An attacker could input a malicious command like `rm -rf /`.
    *   **Impact:** Command Injection, arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid Dynamic Command Construction: Whenever possible, avoid constructing commands dynamically based on user input.
        *   Whitelist Allowed Commands: If dynamic execution is necessary, strictly whitelist the allowed commands and their arguments.
        *   Input Sanitization and Validation: Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user input used in process execution.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run child processes with the minimum necessary privileges.
