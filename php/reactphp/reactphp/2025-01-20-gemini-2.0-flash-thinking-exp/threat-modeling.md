# Threat Model Analysis for reactphp/reactphp

## Threat: [Unhandled Promise Rejection/Exception Exploitation](./threats/unhandled_promise_rejectionexception_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might trigger a series of actions that lead to an unhandled Promise rejection or exception *within ReactPHP's core components or its officially maintained libraries*. This could be done by sending unexpected input to networking components or exploiting edge cases in how ReactPHP handles asynchronous operations.
    *   **Impact:** The application might crash, become unresponsive, or enter an undefined state, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Event Loop, Promise implementation within core ReactPHP components (e.g., `react/http`, `react/socket`, `react/dns`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all asynchronous operations within the application that interact with ReactPHP components have robust error handling using `.catch()` blocks.
        *   Utilize asynchronous `try/catch` statements where appropriate, especially around calls to ReactPHP's asynchronous functions.
        *   Stay updated with ReactPHP releases and apply any security patches related to error handling.

## Threat: [Asynchronous Operation Resource Exhaustion](./threats/asynchronous_operation_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send a large number of requests or trigger events that initiate numerous asynchronous operations *managed by ReactPHP's event loop* without proper limits. This could overwhelm the application with pending tasks handled by ReactPHP, consuming excessive memory, CPU, or file descriptors managed by ReactPHP's internal mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** The application might become slow, unresponsive, or crash due to resource exhaustion, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Event Loop, `react/async` (if used for task scheduling), `react/socket` (handling numerous connections), `react/filesystem` (handling many file operations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting for incoming requests or events that trigger asynchronous operations handled by ReactPHP.
        *   Use libraries or patterns to implement backpressure for asynchronous operations managed by ReactPHP.
        *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors) of the ReactPHP process and set alerts for abnormal consumption.

## Threat: [Connection Flooding Denial of Service](./threats/connection_flooding_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the ReactPHP application with a large number of connection requests, overwhelming the `react/socket` or `react/http` components and exhausting server resources managed by ReactPHP's networking layer.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react/socket` (TCP/IP server), `react/http` (HTTP server).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure connection limits within the application using ReactPHP's server options if available.
        *   Utilize network infrastructure (firewalls, load balancers) to filter malicious traffic and limit connections before they reach the ReactPHP application.
        *   Implement timeouts for idle connections managed by ReactPHP to free up resources.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying SSL/TLS Implementation](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_ssltls_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the PHP's built-in SSL/TLS implementation *used by ReactPHP for secure connections*. This is a vulnerability in a dependency directly utilized by ReactPHP for its secure networking features.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of secure communication, potential for eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, or data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react/socket` (when using secure streams), `react/http` (HTTPS server).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep PHP updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches in the underlying SSL/TLS implementation.
        *   Ensure proper configuration of SSL/TLS settings when using ReactPHP's secure connection options, including strong cipher suites and up-to-date CA certificates.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Child Process Execution](./threats/command_injection_via_child_process_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `react/child-process` to execute external commands based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands *that are then executed by ReactPHP's child process management*.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react/child-process`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid executing external commands based on user input when using `react/child-process`.
        *   If necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization before passing arguments to `react/child-process`.
        *   Use parameterized commands or libraries that prevent command injection when working with `react/child-process`.
        *   Run child processes spawned by `react/child-process` with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Fork Bombing (Child Processes)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_fork_bombing__child_processes_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application to create a large number of child processes *using ReactPHP's `react/child-process` component*, exhausting system resources.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, system instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react/child-process`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the number of child processes that can be spawned using `react/child-process`.
        *   Monitor resource usage of processes spawned by `react/child-process` and implement safeguards against excessive process creation.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in ReactPHP Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_reactphp_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that ReactPHP directly depends on for its core functionality.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution within the ReactPHP application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various core ReactPHP components depending on the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update ReactPHP and its direct dependencies to the latest stable versions to benefit from security patches.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies and identify potential vulnerabilities in ReactPHP's direct dependencies.
