# Threat Model Analysis for reactphp/reactphp

## Threat: [Unbounded Asynchronous Operations Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/unbounded_asynchronous_operations_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can flood the application with requests or inputs that trigger numerous asynchronous operations without proper limits. This can consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors, network bandwidth), leading to application slowdown or complete Denial of Service (DoS). This is directly related to ReactPHP's event-driven nature efficiently handling many concurrent operations, which can be exploited if not controlled.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown, service unavailability, server crash.
*   **ReactPHP Component Affected:** ReactPHP Event Loop, `react/socket` (for network connections), `react/http` (for HTTP servers), application logic handling incoming requests/connections.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement connection limits within the ReactPHP application or using a reverse proxy.
    *   Implement request rate limiting within the application or using a reverse proxy/WAF.
    *   Set timeouts for asynchronous operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
    *   Monitor server resource usage and implement alerts for unusual spikes.
    *   Utilize operating system level resource limits (e.g., `ulimit`).

## Threat: [Slowloris-style Attacks on ReactPHP HTTP Servers](./threats/slowloris-style_attacks_on_reactphp_http_servers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends slow, incomplete HTTP requests to the ReactPHP server, keeping connections open for extended periods. By sending many such requests, they can exhaust the server's connection limit, preventing legitimate users from connecting and causing Denial of Service (DoS). This exploits the asynchronous connection handling of `react/http`.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), HTTP server unresponsiveness, service unavailability.
*   **ReactPHP Component Affected:** `react/http` (HTTP server component), `react/socket` (socket handling).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure `react/http` server timeouts for headers and request bodies to close slow connections.
    *   Implement connection limits in `react/http` or using a reverse proxy.
    *   Employ a reverse proxy or load balancer with built-in Slowloris protection mechanisms (timeouts, connection limits, request buffering).
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) capable of detecting and mitigating Slowloris attacks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ReactPHP Core Packages](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_reactphp_core_packages.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can exploit known vulnerabilities within ReactPHP's core packages (e.g., `react/event-loop`, `react/stream`, `react/http`). These vulnerabilities could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution (RCE), directly impacting the ReactPHP framework itself and applications built upon it.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, data breach, complete application compromise.
*   **ReactPHP Component Affected:** ReactPHP core packages (e.g., `react/event-loop`, `react/stream`, `react/http`, `react/socket`, `react/dns`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability, RCE is critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately** update ReactPHP core packages to the latest versions upon release of security patches.
    *   Subscribe to ReactPHP security advisories and monitor vulnerability databases.
    *   Implement a robust vulnerability management process for ReactPHP and its dependencies.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on ReactPHP components.

## Threat: [Event Loop Blocking Operations](./threats/event_loop_blocking_operations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might intentionally inject blocking operations into the application's event handlers or exploit existing blocking operations in the application code. This directly undermines ReactPHP's non-blocking nature, stalling the event loop and causing a complete Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness, service disruption, performance degradation.
*   **ReactPHP Component Affected:** ReactPHP Event Loop, application event handlers, any code executed within the event loop.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly avoid** using any blocking operations within ReactPHP's event loop.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate any accidental blocking operations.
    *   Enforce the use of asynchronous, non-blocking alternatives for all I/O operations (file I/O, network requests, database queries, etc.).
    *   Implement monitoring to detect event loop blocking and trigger alerts for administrators.

## Threat: [HTTP Server Component Vulnerabilities (e.g., Request Smuggling, Header Injection)](./threats/http_server_component_vulnerabilities__e_g___request_smuggling__header_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities specifically within the `react/http` server component, such as request smuggling or header injection. These vulnerabilities are specific to HTTP server implementations and can be present in `react/http` if not carefully developed and maintained. Request smuggling can bypass security controls, while header injection can lead to XSS or other attacks.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), security bypass, application compromise.
*   **ReactPHP Component Affected:** `react/http` (HTTP server component), request handling logic in the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitability, request smuggling can be critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all HTTP requests processed by `react/http`, including headers and body.
    *   Ensure correct and secure handling of HTTP headers in `react/http` to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Verify proper parsing and handling of HTTP requests within `react/http` to prevent request smuggling.
    *   Utilize a reverse proxy or load balancer with built-in HTTP security features in front of the ReactPHP application.
    *   Keep `react/http` and related components updated to the latest versions.
