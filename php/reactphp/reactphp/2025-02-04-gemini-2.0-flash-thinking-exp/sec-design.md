# BUSINESS POSTURE

ReactPHP is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O framework for PHP. It allows developers to build high-performance network applications and services in PHP, overcoming the traditional synchronous nature of the language for I/O operations.

- Business priorities:
  - High performance and scalability for PHP applications.
  - Enablement of real-time applications and services in PHP.
  - Efficient handling of concurrent network connections.
  - Asynchronous processing to improve application responsiveness.

- Business risks:
  - Performance bottlenecks due to inefficient use of asynchronous patterns.
  - Instability and unexpected behavior in complex asynchronous code.
  - Security vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of asynchronous operations and external inputs.
  - Dependency on the stability and security of the ReactPHP library itself.
  - Potential for denial-of-service attacks if not properly configured and secured.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Open-source project with community review (GitHub repository).
  - security control: Reliance on PHP's built-in security features and extensions.
  - security control: Use of Composer for dependency management, allowing for dependency updates and security patching.
  - security control: Documentation and examples provided to guide developers in using the library securely (project documentation).

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in the ReactPHP library itself, requiring timely updates.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities introduced by developers using ReactPHP incorrectly.
  - accepted risk: Risks associated with open-source dependencies used by ReactPHP.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning of ReactPHP library and dependent components.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits of applications built using ReactPHP.
  - security control: Provide secure coding guidelines and best practices for developers using ReactPHP.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and input validation in applications using ReactPHP to mitigate denial-of-service and injection attacks.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Applications built with ReactPHP may require authentication mechanisms to verify user or system identities. This should be implemented at the application level, utilizing appropriate authentication protocols and libraries.
  - Authorization: Applications must implement authorization controls to manage access to resources and functionalities based on authenticated identities. This should be designed and implemented within the application logic.
  - Input validation: All external inputs, especially network inputs, must be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, header injection). ReactPHP applications should employ input sanitization and validation techniques.
  - Cryptography: If applications handle sensitive data, cryptography must be used to protect data in transit and at rest. ReactPHP can be used to build applications that utilize encryption libraries and protocols provided by PHP or external services.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes:
  - Applications built using ReactPHP that provide real-time services, handle network communication, or require high performance. The criticality depends on the specific application and its business impact.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - The data sensitivity depends entirely on the applications built using ReactPHP. ReactPHP itself is a library and does not inherently handle or store specific business data. Applications might handle various types of data, including:
    - User credentials (highly sensitive)
    - Personal identifiable information (PII) (sensitive)
    - Financial transactions (sensitive)
    - Application-specific data (sensitivity varies)
  - The sensitivity of data must be assessed in the context of each application built with ReactPHP.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: The primary business goal for using ReactPHP is to improve the performance and scalability of PHP applications, especially for network-intensive tasks.
  - Question: What are the specific types of applications being built with ReactPHP? Are they customer-facing, internal tools, or APIs? What are the expected performance and scalability requirements?

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Security is a shared responsibility between the ReactPHP library and the developers using it. Applications built with ReactPHP need to implement their own security controls.
  - Question: What are the existing security policies and procedures within the organization using ReactPHP? Are there specific security requirements or compliance standards that need to be met?

- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: ReactPHP is used as a library within PHP applications. The design focuses on the library's components and how applications integrate with it.
  - Question: Are there any specific architectural patterns or frameworks being used in conjunction with ReactPHP? Are there any specific deployment constraints or requirements? What are the expected traffic patterns and load on the applications?
