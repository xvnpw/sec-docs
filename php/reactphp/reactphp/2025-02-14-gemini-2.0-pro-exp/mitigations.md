# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for reactphp/reactphp

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Asynchronous Libraries and Child Processes (ReactPHP-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/use_asynchronous_libraries_and_child_processes__reactphp-centric_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Use Asynchronous Libraries and Child Processes (ReactPHP-Centric)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Blocking Operations:** Analyze the codebase for *any* synchronous, blocking operations within event loop callbacks.  This is the most critical step for ReactPHP applications.
    2.  **Mandatory Use of ReactPHP Asynchronous Components:**  *Strictly enforce* the use of ReactPHP's asynchronous components for *all* I/O.  This means:
        *   `react/http` for *all* HTTP client and server interactions.
        *   `react/socket` for *all* socket-level communication (TCP, UDP).
        *   `react/filesystem` for *all* file system operations (reading, writing, directory manipulation).
        *   `react/mysql` or `react/pgsql` (or other ReactPHP-compatible database clients) for *all* database interactions.  *Never* use blocking database drivers.
        *   `react/dns` for *all* DNS resolution.
    3.  **Child Processes for CPU-Bound Tasks (via `react/child-process`):**  If any operation is inherently CPU-bound (heavy computation, image processing, etc.), it *must* be offloaded to a separate process using `react/child-process`.  The main event loop should *never* perform heavy computation directly.
    4.  **Asynchronous Inter-Process Communication:**  Communication between the main process and child processes *must* be asynchronous, using ReactPHP streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) on the `Process` object.
    5.  **Process Lifecycle Management:**  Use ReactPHP's event handling to manage the child process lifecycle (start, exit, error handling).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Event Loop Blocking (DoS):** *Severity: High*. This is the core threat addressed by this strategy.
    *   **Slow Request Handling:** *Severity: Medium*.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Indirectly):** *Severity: Medium*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Event Loop Blocking (DoS):** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Slow Request Handling:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Indirectly contributes to reducing the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/src/HttpServer.php`: Uses `react/http`.
    *   `/src/Services/ImageProcessor.php`: Uses `react/child-process`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `/src/Legacy/ReportGenerator.php`: Needs complete refactoring to use `react/filesystem` and a ReactPHP database client.
    *   `/src/Services/ExternalApi.php`: Requires a ReactPHP-compatible asynchronous wrapper or child process implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Promise Rejection Handling (ReactPHP Promises)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_promise_rejection_handling__reactphp_promises_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Comprehensive Promise Rejection Handling (ReactPHP Promises)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify All ReactPHP Promises:**  Locate all uses of Promises, both explicit (`new React\Promise\Deferred()`) and implicit (return values from ReactPHP components).
    2.  **Mandatory Rejection Handlers:**  *Every* Promise *must* have a rejection handler, either via `->catch()` or the second argument to `->then()`.  This is non-negotiable in a ReactPHP application.
    3.  **ReactPHP-Specific Error Logging:**  Within rejection handlers, log errors using a system compatible with ReactPHP's asynchronous nature.  Consider using a dedicated asynchronous logging library if necessary.
    4.  **Centralized Error Handling (ReactPHP Context):**  Implement a centralized error handling mechanism *specifically designed for ReactPHP's asynchronous context*. This might involve a custom error handler that can interact with the event loop.
    5.  **Promise Cancellation (ReactPHP Cleanup):**  Use ReactPHP's promise cancellation mechanisms (`$deferred->reject()`, `$cancellablePromise->cancel()`) to properly clean up resources and prevent memory leaks when asynchronous operations are no longer needed (timeouts, client disconnects, etc.). This is crucial for long-running ReactPHP applications.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unhandled Promise Rejections:** *Severity: High*.
    *   **Silent Failures:** *Severity: Medium*.
    *   **Resource Leaks (with Cancellation):** *Severity: Medium*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unhandled Promise Rejections:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Silent Failures:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Resource Leaks:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/src/HttpServer.php`: Basic rejection handling.
    *   `/src/Services/DatabaseClient.php`: Basic rejection handling.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `/src/Legacy/ReportGenerator.php`: Needs complete Promise integration and rejection handling.
    *   `/src/Services/ExternalApi.php`: Requires thorough rejection handling in its asynchronous wrapper.
    *   No centralized, ReactPHP-aware error handling system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Shared State and Address Concurrency (ReactPHP Context)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_shared_state_and_address_concurrency__reactphp_context_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Minimize Shared State and Address Concurrency (ReactPHP Context)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Shared Resources (ReactPHP Scope):**  Analyze the codebase within the context of ReactPHP's single-threaded, event-driven model. Identify any resources accessed by multiple asynchronous callbacks.
    2.  **Reduce Shared State (ReactPHP Design):**  Refactor the application architecture to minimize shared state *specifically within the ReactPHP event loop*.  Favor passing data explicitly between callbacks.
    3.  **Immutability:**  Use immutable data structures where possible within the ReactPHP context.
    4.  **ReactPHP Connection Pooling:**  For database interactions, *exclusively* use ReactPHP's asynchronous database clients (e.g., `react/mysql`, `react/pgsql`) with their built-in connection pooling.  Configure the pool size appropriately.
    5.  **Avoid Blocking Synchronization:**  *Never* use standard PHP blocking synchronization mechanisms within the ReactPHP event loop. This is critical.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Race Conditions (ReactPHP-Specific):** *Severity: Medium*.
    *   **Deadlocks (Avoided):** *Severity: High*.
    *   **Database Connection Exhaustion:** *Severity: Medium*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Race Conditions:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Deadlocks:** Risk minimized by avoiding blocking primitives.
    *   **Database Connection Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/src/Services/DatabaseClient.php`: Uses `react/mysql` with connection pooling.
    *   Good general design practices regarding shared state.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `/src/Legacy/ReportGenerator.php`: Requires review for potential ReactPHP-specific concurrency issues.
    *   Thorough review of all external resource interactions within the ReactPHP context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Manage Resources and Implement Backpressure (ReactPHP Streams)](./mitigation_strategies/manage_resources_and_implement_backpressure__reactphp_streams_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Manage Resources and Implement Backpressure (ReactPHP Streams)**

* **Description:**
    1. **ReactPHP `Socket\Server` Connection Limits:** Configure ReactPHP's `Socket\Server` to limit concurrent connections. This is a direct use of a ReactPHP component for security.
    2. **File Descriptor Awareness (ReactPHP Context):** Be mindful of file descriptor limits *within the context of ReactPHP's asynchronous operations*. Ensure resources are closed promptly using ReactPHP's asynchronous mechanisms.
    3. **Memory Management (ReactPHP Long-Running):** Monitor memory usage, especially in long-running ReactPHP applications. Avoid accumulating large data in memory within the event loop.
    4. **ReactPHP Streaming and Chunking:** For large data, *exclusively* use ReactPHP's streaming capabilities (`react/stream`). Process data in chunks, avoiding loading entire files or responses into memory.
    5. **ReactPHP Backpressure Implementation:** Implement backpressure using ReactPHP's stream `pause()` and `resume()` methods. This is a *direct application of ReactPHP's API* to prevent resource exhaustion. Control the flow of data based on the consumer's processing speed.
    6. **ReactPHP Timeouts:** Use ReactPHP's timer functionality (`$loop->addTimer()`) in conjunction with promise cancellation to implement timeouts on *all* asynchronous operations. This prevents indefinite hangs.

* **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Resource Exhaustion (DoS):** *Severity: High*.
    * **Slowloris Attacks:** *Severity: Medium*.
    * **Memory Leaks (ReactPHP-Specific):** *Severity: Medium*.

* **Impact:**
    * **Resource Exhaustion (DoS):** Risk reduced from *High* to *Medium* or *Low*.
    * **Slowloris Attacks:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    * **Memory Leaks:** Risk reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Timeouts are implemented using `$loop->addTimer()`.
    * `/src/HttpServer.php`: Connection limits on `Socket\Server`.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Backpressure is not consistently used with `react/stream`.
    * `/src/Legacy/ReportGenerator.php`: Needs to use `react/filesystem` streaming.
    * Regular memory profiling within the ReactPHP context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure DNS Resolution (Using `react/dns`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dns_resolution__using__reactdns__.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy: Secure DNS Resolution (Using `react/dns`)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Exclusive Use of `react/dns`:**  *All* DNS resolution *must* be performed using ReactPHP's `react/dns` component.  Do not use standard PHP DNS functions.
    2.  **Enable Caching (ReactPHP Resolver):**  Configure the `react/dns` `Resolver` to use its built-in caching mechanism. This is a direct configuration of a ReactPHP component.
    3.  **ReactPHP Timeouts:**  Set appropriate timeouts for DNS lookups using the `Resolver`'s configuration options.
    4.  **Multiple DNS Servers (ReactPHP Config):**  Configure the `Resolver` with multiple DNS servers for redundancy.
    5.  **Local DNS Cache (Consider):**  While not strictly a ReactPHP component, consider using a local DNS cache and configuring `react/dns` to use it.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Slow DNS Resolution (DoS):** *Severity: Medium*.
    *   **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning (Indirectly):** *Severity: High*.
    *   **DNS Outages:** *Severity: Medium*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Slow DNS Resolution (DoS):** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning:** Risk indirectly reduced.
    *   **DNS Outages:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application uses `react/dns`.
    *   Timeouts are configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `react/dns` caching is not enabled.
    *   Only one DNS server is configured in `react/dns`.
    *   No local DNS caching server.
