# Deep Analysis: Slowloris-Type Attacks on ReactPHP Applications

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability of ReactPHP applications to Slowloris-type attacks, identify specific attack vectors, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies that leverage ReactPHP's features and best practices.  We aim to provide developers with the knowledge and tools to build resilient applications.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on Slowloris-type attacks targeting the asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model of ReactPHP.  We will consider:

*   **ReactPHP Components:**  `react/socket`, `react/http`, and related components involved in handling network connections and streams.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  How Slowloris attacks can deplete file descriptors, memory, and other resources managed by ReactPHP.
*   **Attack Variations:**  Different techniques attackers might use to prolong connections and consume resources slowly.
*   **Mitigation Techniques:**  Strategies that directly utilize ReactPHP's API and event loop to counter these attacks.
*   **Code Examples:** Where applicable, provide illustrative code snippets demonstrating mitigation techniques.

We will *not* cover:

*   Generic DDoS attacks that are not specific to ReactPHP's asynchronous nature (e.g., volumetric attacks).
*   Attacks targeting other layers of the application stack (e.g., database attacks), unless they directly relate to the Slowloris vulnerability within ReactPHP.
*   Mitigation strategies that are purely external to the ReactPHP application (e.g., firewall rules, although we'll mention their complementary role).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Technical Deep Dive:**  Examine the relevant ReactPHP components and how they handle connections and streams.  Identify the specific mechanisms that make ReactPHP susceptible to Slowloris.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Describe various ways an attacker could exploit these mechanisms, including variations on the basic Slowloris technique.
3.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies, focusing on how to use ReactPHP's features (e.g., `Promise\Timer`, event loop callbacks) to counter the attacks.
4.  **Code Example Illustration:**  Provide code examples demonstrating the implementation of key mitigation techniques.
5.  **Limitations and Considerations:**  Discuss the limitations of the proposed mitigations and any trade-offs involved.
6.  **Best Practices:** Summarize best practices for building resilient ReactPHP applications.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Technical Deep Dive: ReactPHP and Connection Handling

ReactPHP's core strength lies in its asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model.  This allows it to handle many concurrent connections without creating a new thread or process for each.  However, this model also introduces the vulnerability to Slowloris.

*   **`react/socket`:** This component provides the foundation for creating TCP/IP servers and clients.  It uses an event loop (`React\EventLoop\LoopInterface`) to manage connections.  When a client connects, a `React\Socket\ConnectionInterface` object is created, representing the connection.  This object emits events like `data`, `end`, and `error`.
*   **`react/http`:**  Built on top of `react/socket`, this component provides an HTTP server.  It uses `react/socket` to manage the underlying TCP connections and parses HTTP requests and responses.
*   **Event Loop:** The event loop is the heart of ReactPHP.  It continuously monitors for events (e.g., data arriving on a socket, a timer expiring) and dispatches callbacks to handle those events.
*   **Resource Limits:**  While ReactPHP can handle many connections, there are inherent limits:
    *   **File Descriptors:**  Each open connection consumes a file descriptor.  Operating systems have limits on the number of file descriptors a process can have.
    *   **Memory:**  Each connection requires some memory to store its state, buffers, etc.
    *   **Event Loop Overhead:**  While the event loop is efficient, managing a very large number of connections still incurs some overhead.

**The Vulnerability:**  Slowloris exploits the fact that ReactPHP, by default, doesn't aggressively close connections that are sending data very slowly.  The attacker keeps the connections "alive" by sending minimal data, preventing the server from freeing up resources.  The event loop continues to monitor these connections, consuming resources even though they are not doing anything useful.

### 2.2. Attack Vector Analysis

An attacker can employ several variations of the Slowloris attack:

*   **Slow Headers:**  The attacker sends HTTP headers very slowly, one byte at a time, with long delays between bytes.  ReactPHP's HTTP server will wait for the complete headers before processing the request.
*   **Slow Body:**  The attacker sends the HTTP request body very slowly, again, one byte at a time.  This can tie up resources allocated for handling the request body.
*   **Incomplete Requests:** The attacker never sends the final CRLF (`\r\n\r\n`) that signals the end of the HTTP headers, keeping the connection open indefinitely.
*   **Many Connections:**  The attacker opens a large number of connections, even if each connection is only sending data *extremely* slowly.  The cumulative effect exhausts resources.
*   **Combination:** The attacker combines the above techniques, opening many connections and sending both headers and body data slowly and incompletely.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategy Development

Here are specific mitigation strategies, leveraging ReactPHP's features:

*   **2.3.1. Aggressive Timeouts (using `Promise\Timer`)**

    This is the most crucial and direct mitigation.  ReactPHP's `Promise\Timer` allows us to set timeouts for various operations.

    *   **Read Timeout:**  Set a timeout for reading data from a connection.  If no data is received within the timeout period, close the connection.
    *   **Write Timeout:**  Set a timeout for writing data to a connection.  While less directly related to Slowloris, this can help prevent issues if the client is slow to *receive* data.
    *   **Idle Timeout:**  Set a timeout for overall connection inactivity.  If no data is sent *or* received within the timeout period, close the connection.

    ```php
    use React\Socket\ConnectionInterface;
    use React\EventLoop\LoopInterface;
    use React\Promise\Timer;

    function handleConnection(ConnectionInterface $connection, LoopInterface $loop) {
        $readTimeoutSeconds = 10; // Timeout for reading data
        $idleTimeoutSeconds = 30; // Timeout for overall inactivity

        $readTimer = Timer\timeout($connection->on('data', function ($data) use (&$readTimer, $loop, $readTimeoutSeconds) {
            // Reset the read timer on each data chunk
            $loop->cancelTimer($readTimer);
            $readTimer = Timer\timeout($connection->on('data', function(){}), $readTimeoutSeconds, $loop);
            $readTimer->then(function() use ($connection){
                echo "Read timeout! Closing connection.\n";
                $connection->close();
            });
            // Process the data...
        }), $readTimeoutSeconds, $loop);

        $readTimer->then(function() use ($connection){
            echo "Read timeout! Closing connection.\n";
            $connection->close();
        });

        $idleTimer = Timer\timeout($connection->on('data', function() use(&$idleTimer, $loop, $idleTimeoutSeconds){
            $loop->cancelTimer($idleTimer);
            $idleTimer = Timer\timeout($connection->on('data', function(){}), $idleTimeoutSeconds, $loop);
            $idleTimer->then(function() use ($connection){
                echo "Idle timeout! Closing connection.\n";
                $connection->close();
            });
        }), $idleTimeoutSeconds, $loop);

        $idleTimer->then(function() use ($connection){
            echo "Idle timeout! Closing connection.\n";
            $connection->close();
        });
    }
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    * We use `React\Promise\Timer\timeout` to create a timer that will reject a promise after a specified duration.
    * The `timeout` function takes three arguments: the promise to be timed, the timeout duration in seconds, and the event loop.
    * Inside `handleConnection`, we set up a `readTimer` and `idleTimer`.
    * The `readTimer` is reset every time data is received. If the timer expires before new data arrives, the connection is closed.
    * The `idleTimer` works similarly, but it's reset on *any* data activity (read or write, in a full implementation).
    *  Crucially, we use `&$readTimer` and `&$idleTimer` to pass the timer variables by reference, allowing us to cancel them within the data event handler.

*   **2.3.2. Connection Limits (ReactPHP's Socket Server)**

    Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections accepted by the ReactPHP socket server.  This prevents an attacker from opening an unlimited number of connections.

    ```php
    use React\Socket\SocketServer;
    use React\EventLoop\Loop;

    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    $loop = Loop::get();
    $socket = new SocketServer('127.0.0.1:8080', [], $loop);

    $maxConnections = 100; // Set a reasonable limit
    $currentConnections = 0;

    $socket->on('connection', function ($connection) use (&$currentConnections, $maxConnections, $loop) {
        if ($currentConnections >= $maxConnections) {
            echo "Connection refused: Too many connections.\n";
            $connection->close();
            return;
        }

        $currentConnections++;
        echo "New connection! Total: $currentConnections\n";

        $connection->on('close', function () use (&$currentConnections) {
            $currentConnections--;
            echo "Connection closed. Total: $currentConnections\n";
        });

        handleConnection($connection, $loop); // Use the handleConnection function from above
    });

    $loop->run();
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    *   We use a counter (`$currentConnections`) to track the number of active connections.
    *   Before accepting a new connection, we check if the limit (`$maxConnections`) has been reached.  If so, we immediately close the connection.
    *   We decrement the counter when a connection is closed.

*   **2.3.3. Rate Limiting (Middleware)**

    While ReactPHP doesn't have built-in rate limiting, you can implement it using middleware, especially in an HTTP context.  This limits the number of connections or requests from a single IP address within a given time window.

    ```php
    // (Conceptual example - a full implementation would be more complex)
    use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
    use React\Http\Message\Response;

    $rateLimits = []; // IP => [timestamp, count]
    $rateLimitWindow = 60; // Seconds
    $rateLimitMax = 10; // Max connections/requests per window

    $rateLimitingMiddleware = function (ServerRequestInterface $request, callable $next) use (&$rateLimits, $rateLimitWindow, $rateLimitMax) {
        $ip = $request->getServerParams()['REMOTE_ADDR'];

        if (!isset($rateLimits[$ip])) {
            $rateLimits[$ip] = [time(), 1];
        } else {
            $lastRequestTime = $rateLimits[$ip][0];
            $requestCount = $rateLimits[$ip][1];

            if (time() - $lastRequestTime < $rateLimitWindow) {
                if ($requestCount >= $rateLimitMax) {
                    return new Response(429, ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain'], 'Too Many Requests');
                }
                $rateLimits[$ip][1]++;
            } else {
                $rateLimits[$ip] = [time(), 1]; // Reset
            }
        }

        return $next($request);
    };

    // ... (Use this middleware in your ReactPHP HTTP server) ...
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    *   This is a *simplified* example of a rate-limiting middleware.  A production-ready implementation would likely use a more robust storage mechanism (e.g., Redis) instead of an in-memory array.
    *   The middleware tracks the number of requests from each IP address within a time window.
    *   If the limit is exceeded, it returns a 429 (Too Many Requests) response.

*   **2.3.4. Request Header Size Limits**
    Limit the maximum size of the HTTP request headers. This prevents attackers from sending extremely large headers to consume memory.  ReactPHP's `HttpServer` doesn't have a direct option for this, but you can implement it by inspecting the incoming data stream and closing the connection if the header size exceeds a limit.

    ```php
    //Within handleConnection, before processing as HTTP
    $maxHeaderSize = 8192; // 8KB
    $receivedData = '';

    $connection->on('data', function ($data) use (&$receivedData, $maxHeaderSize, $connection) {
        $receivedData .= $data;

        // Check if we've received the end of the headers
        if (strpos($receivedData, "\r\n\r\n") !== false) {
            list($headers, $body) = explode("\r\n\r\n", $receivedData, 2);

             if (strlen($headers) > $maxHeaderSize) {
                echo "Request header too large! Closing connection.\n";
                $connection->close();
                return;
            }
            //Process http request
        } elseif(strlen($receivedData) > $maxHeaderSize){
            echo "Request header too large! Closing connection.\n";
            $connection->close();
            return;
        }
    });
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    *   We accumulate the incoming data in `$receivedData`.
    *   We check if the accumulated data exceeds `$maxHeaderSize`. If it does, we close the connection.
    *   We also check for the end-of-headers marker (`\r\n\r\n`). If found *and* the header size is within limits, we proceed to process the request.

### 2.4. Limitations and Considerations

*   **Resource Consumption:**  Even with aggressive timeouts, an attacker can still consume *some* resources before the timeouts trigger.  The goal is to minimize this consumption and prevent complete denial of service.
*   **False Positives:**  Very short timeouts might inadvertently close legitimate connections if the client is experiencing network issues or is genuinely slow (e.g., a client on a low-bandwidth connection).  Careful tuning is required.
*   **Complexity:**  Implementing these mitigations adds complexity to the application code.
*   **Rate Limiting Challenges:**  Rate limiting can be bypassed by attackers using multiple IP addresses (distributed attacks).  It's a helpful layer of defense, but not a silver bullet.
* **Complementary Measures:** These mitigations are most effective when combined with other security measures, such as:
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Block or limit connections from known malicious IP addresses.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Detect and block Slowloris attacks at the network level.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Provide application-level protection against Slowloris and other attacks.
    *   **Load Balancers:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers, making it harder for an attacker to overwhelm a single server.

### 2.5. Best Practices

*   **Always Use Timeouts:**  Make aggressive timeouts a fundamental part of your ReactPHP application design.  Never assume that clients will behave nicely.
*   **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Use monitoring tools to track resource usage (file descriptors, memory, CPU) and set alerts for unusual activity.
*   **Regularly Review Code:**  Review your code for potential vulnerabilities, especially in areas that handle network connections and streams.
*   **Stay Updated:**  Keep ReactPHP and its dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches and improvements.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Test your application's resilience to Slowloris attacks using tools like `slowhttptest` or custom scripts.
*   **Defense in Depth:**  Implement multiple layers of defense, combining ReactPHP-specific mitigations with external security measures.
*   **Consider using a more robust rate limiting solution:** For production environments, consider using a dedicated rate limiting service or library (e.g., Redis-based rate limiter) instead of a simple in-memory implementation.

## 3. Conclusion

Slowloris-type attacks pose a significant threat to ReactPHP applications due to their reliance on asynchronous I/O. However, by understanding the underlying mechanisms and leveraging ReactPHP's features, developers can effectively mitigate these attacks. Aggressive timeouts, connection limits, rate limiting, and request header size limits, combined with external security measures, are crucial for building resilient and secure ReactPHP applications. Continuous monitoring, regular code reviews, and staying up-to-date with security best practices are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
