## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit ReactPHP Core/Component Vulnerability [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_reactphp_corecomponent_vulnerability__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the exploitation of flaws within the core ReactPHP libraries or its commonly used components.  It's a critical node because successful exploitation here often grants the attacker significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Unpatched Vulnerability [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_unpatched_vulnerability__hr_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in ReactPHP or its components for which patches have not been applied. This is a high-risk path due to the availability of public exploits and the common lag in patching.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (RCE is possible)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement a robust vulnerability scanning and patching process.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for ReactPHP.
    *   Use a dependency manager (Composer) and regularly update.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 CVE in Stream [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_cve_in_stream__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** A specific vulnerability within the `react/stream` component.
*   **Example:** A flaw in handling chunked encoding in an HTTP server.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 CVE in Socket [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_cve_in_socket__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** A specific vulnerability within the `react/socket` component.
*   **Example:** Bypassing authentication on a WebSocket server.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 CVE in HTTP [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_cve_in_http__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** A specific vulnerability within the `react/http` component.
*   **Example:** Injecting malicious headers.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Zero-Day Vulnerability [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_zero-day_vulnerability__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting a vulnerability that is unknown to the developers and for which no patch exists.  Critical node due to the high impact.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE is likely)
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Defense in Depth (multiple security layers).
    *   Anomaly Detection.
    *   Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Misconfiguration [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_misconfiguration__hr_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting weaknesses caused by incorrect configuration of ReactPHP components.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Security audits and configuration reviews.
    *   Follow best practices for each component.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Unsafe Event Handling [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_unsafe_event_handling__hr_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly handling events, especially those triggered by external input, leading to vulnerabilities like code injection.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all input.
    *   Avoid `eval()` or similar constructs.
    *   Use parameterized queries for database interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Asynchronous Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_asynchronous_behavior.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Event Loop Blocking [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_event_loop_blocking__hr_.md)

*   **Description:**  Causing the single-threaded event loop to become unresponsive due to long-running synchronous operations.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Offload long-running operations to child processes or worker threads.
    *   Use asynchronous database drivers and file I/O.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Long Synchronous Operations [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_long_synchronous_operations__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Performing long computations, file I/O, or database queries synchronously within an event handler.
*   **Mitigation:** Use `react/child-process`, asynchronous database drivers (e.g., `react/mysql`), and asynchronous file I/O (e.g., `react/filesystem`).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Resource Exhaustion [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_resource_exhaustion__hr_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Careful resource management.
    *   Resource monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Memory Leaks [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_memory_leaks__hr_.md)

*   **Description:**  Creating objects without releasing them, leading to memory exhaustion.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Careful memory management.
    *   Use memory profilers.
    *   Ensure event listeners are removed.
