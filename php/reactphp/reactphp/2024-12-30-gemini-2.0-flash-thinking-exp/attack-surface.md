*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Event Loop Overload
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a high volume of requests or events designed to overwhelm the ReactPHP event loop, preventing it from processing legitimate tasks.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP's single-threaded, event-driven architecture means that if the event loop is blocked or overloaded, the entire application becomes unresponsive.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends thousands of concurrent HTTP requests without completing them, holding up resources and preventing the server from handling new connections.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unavailable, leading to service disruption and potential financial loss or reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement rate limiting on incoming connections and requests.
            *   Set timeouts for connections and operations to prevent indefinite blocking.
            *   Optimize event handlers to ensure they execute quickly and don't block the event loop.
            *   Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

*   **Attack Surface:** Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Connections (TCP/WebSocket)
    *   **Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of connections (TCP or WebSocket) without proper closure or activity, consuming server resources like memory and file descriptors.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP manages these connections asynchronously. If not handled correctly, the application might not efficiently close idle or malicious connections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker opens thousands of WebSocket connections and keeps them open without sending or receiving data, eventually exhausting server resources.
    *   **Impact:** Server performance degrades, leading to slow response times or crashes. Can also impact other applications running on the same server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement connection timeouts and idle connection management.
            *   Set limits on the maximum number of concurrent connections.
            *   Properly handle connection closure events and release resources.
            *   Consider using connection pooling or similar techniques.

*   **Attack Surface:** HTTP Header Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data into HTTP headers by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application constructs or handles headers based on user input.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** If developers use user-provided data directly to set HTTP headers in `react/http` responses without proper sanitization, this vulnerability can occur.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable application uses user input to set a redirect URL in a header. An attacker injects a newline character followed by malicious headers, potentially leading to HTTP response splitting and XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, session hijacking, and other attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided data before using it in HTTP headers.**
            *   Use built-in functions or libraries that handle header encoding correctly.
            *   Avoid directly constructing headers from user input.

*   **Attack Surface:** WebSocket Frame Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious or unexpected data within WebSocket frames, exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application processes incoming WebSocket messages.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** The `react/socket` component handles WebSocket communication. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize incoming messages, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted WebSocket frame containing malicious JavaScript code, which is then executed by the client-side application, leading to XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on the client-side, unauthorized actions, or manipulation of application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received via WebSocket connections.**
            *   Implement proper message parsing and error handling.
            *   Define a clear message format and enforce it.
            *   Consider using secure serialization formats.

*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection via `Process` Component
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious commands into system calls executed by the application using the `react/child-process` component.
    *   **How ReactPHP Contributes:** The `Process` component allows executing external commands. If user-provided data is used to construct these commands without proper sanitization, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable application allows users to specify a filename to process. An attacker injects a command like `; rm -rf /` into the filename, potentially deleting critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breaches, and significant system damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Absolutely avoid using user-provided data directly in commands executed by the `Process` component.**
            *   If external commands are necessary, use parameterized commands or libraries that provide safe execution mechanisms.
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
            *   Run external processes with the least necessary privileges.
