Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `reactphp/reactphp` library:

- **Threat:** Event Loop Blocking/Starvation
    - **Description:** An attacker sends a request or triggers an event that causes a long-running, synchronous operation *within a ReactPHP event handler*. This directly blocks the `React\EventLoop\LoopInterface`, preventing it from processing other events and making the application unresponsive. The attacker might target specific endpoints or functionalities known to involve potentially blocking operations if not implemented carefully.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service, application becomes unresponsive, inability to process legitimate requests.
    - **Affected Component:** `React\EventLoop\LoopInterface` (the core event loop), specifically the execution of event handlers registered with it.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure all event handlers and callbacks registered with the `EventLoop` perform non-blocking operations.
        - Offload CPU-intensive tasks to separate processes or threads using libraries like `react/child-process` or `amphp/parallel`.
        - Implement timeouts for operations within event handlers to prevent indefinite blocking of the event loop.
        - Monitor event loop latency and identify potential blocking operations.

- **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Event Loop
    - **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or triggers events that cause the `React\EventLoop\LoopInterface` to manage an excessive number of resources (e.g., open sockets via `React\Socket\Server`, pending timers). This can lead to memory exhaustion or exceeding system limits, causing the application to crash.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service, application crash due to memory exhaustion or exceeding resource limits.
    - **Affected Component:** `React\EventLoop\LoopInterface`, `React\Socket\Server` (managing connections), `React\EventLoop\Timer\TimerInterface` (managing timers).
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement rate limiting on incoming connections and requests handled by `React\Socket\Server` or `React\Http\Server`.
        - Set limits on the number of concurrent connections accepted by `React\Socket\Server`.
        - Implement backpressure mechanisms to control the rate of data processing within event handlers.
        - Monitor resource usage (memory, CPU, file descriptors) associated with the event loop and its managed resources.

- **Threat:** Denial of Service via Socket Flooding
    - **Description:** An attacker floods a `React\Socket\Server` with a large number of connection requests or data packets, overwhelming the server's ability to handle legitimate traffic. This exploits the underlying non-blocking socket handling of ReactPHP.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service, application becomes unavailable.
    - **Affected Component:** `React\Socket\Server`, the underlying non-blocking socket implementation used by ReactPHP.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement rate limiting on incoming connections at the `React\Socket\Server` level.
        - Set limits on the number of concurrent connections accepted by `React\Socket\Server`.
        - Consider using a reverse proxy or load balancer with DDoS protection capabilities in front of the ReactPHP application.
        - Implement connection timeouts on the `React\Socket\Server`.

- **Threat:** HTTP Request Smuggling (if using `react/http`)
    - **Description:** If the application uses `react/http` to act as an HTTP server, vulnerabilities in its HTTP parsing logic could allow an attacker to craft malicious requests that are interpreted differently by the ReactPHP server and backend servers (if any). This can bypass security controls and lead to unauthorized access or actions.
    - **Impact:** Bypass security controls, potential for unauthorized access or actions on the ReactPHP application or backend services.
    - **Affected Component:** `React\Http\Server`, `React\Http\Request`, the underlying HTTP parsing logic within `react/http`.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Use the latest stable version of `react/http` which includes mitigations for known request smuggling techniques.
        - Carefully validate and sanitize incoming HTTP headers and bodies within your application logic.
        - Avoid relying on potentially ambiguous HTTP parsing behavior.
        - If using a reverse proxy, ensure it normalizes requests before forwarding them to the ReactPHP application.
