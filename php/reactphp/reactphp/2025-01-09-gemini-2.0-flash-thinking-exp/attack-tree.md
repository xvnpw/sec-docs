# Attack Tree Analysis for reactphp/reactphp

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized control over the application's state or resources by exploiting vulnerabilities within the ReactPHP framework or its usage.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Compromise ReactPHP Application
    *   ***Denial of Service (DoS) via ReactPHP [CRITICAL]***
        *   ***Event Loop Overload [CRITICAL]***
            *   ***Send Large Number of Requests [HIGH-RISK PATH]***
        *   ***Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]***
            *   ***Connection Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]***
    *   ***Remote Code Execution (RCE) via ReactPHP (Less Likely in Core, More in Extensions) [CRITICAL]***
        *   ***Exploiting Vulnerabilities in ReactPHP Extensions [HIGH-RISK PATH]***
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via ReactPHP [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_reactphp__critical_.md)

**Goal:** To make the application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming its resources or event loop.

*   **Event Loop Overload [CRITICAL]**

    *   **Goal:** To flood the ReactPHP event loop with more events than it can handle, causing delays, slowdowns, or complete unresponsiveness.

    *   **Send Large Number of Requests [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a massive number of requests to the application in a short period.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High (Application Unavailability)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Spike in traffic)
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting at the application level. Review event handlers for efficiency. Implement timeouts for client connections.

*   **Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL]**

    *   **Goal:** To consume critical resources (connections, memory, file descriptors) to the point where the application can no longer function.

    *   **Connection Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker opens a large number of connections to the application but does not close them properly, exhausting the available connection pool.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Application instability, potential unavailability)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (High number of open connections)
        *   **Mitigation:** Set limits on the number of concurrent connections. Implement proper connection management (closing connections). Implement timeouts for idle connections.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via ReactPHP (Less Likely in Core, More in Extensions) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_reactphp__less_likely_in_core__more_in_extensions___critical_.md)

**Goal:** To execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the ReactPHP application, gaining complete control.

*   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in ReactPHP Extensions [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and exploits known security vulnerabilities in third-party ReactPHP extensions used by the application. This often involves sending specially crafted data or requests that trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on the extension and its security)
    *   **Impact:** Critical (Full control of the application/server)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires vulnerability research or leveraging known exploits)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Unusual process execution, network activity)
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep ReactPHP and its extensions up-to-date. Regularly review security advisories for used packages. Consider using static analysis tools on extension code. Implement strong input validation where extension functionality interacts with external data.
