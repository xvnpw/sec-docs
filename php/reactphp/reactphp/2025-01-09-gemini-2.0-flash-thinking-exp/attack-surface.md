# Attack Surface Analysis for reactphp/reactphp

## Attack Surface: [Asynchronous Request Handling Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/asynchronous_request_handling_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits the asynchronous nature of ReactPHP's HTTP server to overwhelm it with a large number of requests or slow requests, consuming server resources (CPU, memory, connections) and leading to denial of service.

**How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP's non-blocking I/O allows it to handle many concurrent connections. Without proper limits, an attacker can exploit this by opening numerous connections without sending complete requests (Slowloris) or sending a flood of valid requests.

**Example:** An attacker sends thousands of incomplete HTTP requests, holding open connections and preventing the server from accepting new legitimate requests.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement connection limits on the HTTP server.
* Set appropriate timeouts for connections and requests.
* Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) with connection limiting and rate limiting capabilities in front of the ReactPHP application.
* Monitor server resources and implement alerts for unusual activity.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Message Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/websocket_message_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** When using ReactPHP's WebSocket server, attackers can send malicious or unexpected messages to connected clients, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) on the client-side or manipulation of application state.

**How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP provides the infrastructure for WebSocket communication. The responsibility of validating and sanitizing messages lies with the application developer. If this is not done correctly, it creates an attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker sends a WebSocket message containing malicious JavaScript code that is then processed and executed by a connected client's browser.

**Impact:** Client-side XSS, unauthorized actions on behalf of users, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization of all incoming WebSocket messages on the server-side.
* Encode data before sending it to clients to prevent interpretation as code.
* Implement proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections.
* Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) on the client-side to mitigate XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Process Spawning](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_process_spawning.md)

**Description:** If a ReactPHP application uses the `react/child-process` component to execute external commands based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary commands.

**How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP's `ChildProcess` class provides a way to execute external processes. If the arguments passed to this class are derived from untrusted input without proper escaping or validation, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** A web form allows users to specify a filename to process. The application uses `ChildProcess` to execute a command like `process_file <user_input>`. An attacker could input `; rm -rf /` to execute a dangerous command.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data loss, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using user-provided input directly in commands.
* If executing external commands is necessary, use parameterized commands or libraries that provide safe command execution.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in command arguments.
* Run external processes with the least privileges necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Asynchronous Client](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_asynchronous_client.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate the application to make unintended requests to internal or external resources by exploiting the application's use of ReactPHP's asynchronous HTTP client (`react/http`).

**How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP's asynchronous client allows the application to make HTTP requests. If the target URL or parameters of these requests are influenced by user input without proper validation, an attacker can force the application to make requests on their behalf.

**Example:** An application allows users to provide a URL for fetching data. An attacker could provide a URL pointing to an internal service or a sensitive endpoint, potentially gaining access to unauthorized information or triggering actions.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user-provided URLs or hostnames used in outgoing requests.
* Use a whitelist of allowed destination hosts or protocols.
* Avoid directly using user input to construct request URLs.
* Consider using a proxy server for outgoing requests to enforce security policies.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Filesystem Operations](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_filesystem_operations.md)

**Description:** If a ReactPHP application uses user-provided input to construct file paths for reading or writing using `react/filesystem` without proper sanitization, attackers can access files outside the intended directory.

**How ReactPHP Contributes:** ReactPHP's `Filesystem` component provides asynchronous file system operations. If the paths passed to these operations are derived from untrusted input without validation, it can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An application allows users to download files by specifying a filename. An attacker could input `../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using user-provided input directly in file paths.
* Use a whitelist of allowed file paths or a secure method for mapping user input to allowed files.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in file paths.
* Ensure the application runs with the least privileges necessary.
