# Threat Model Analysis for reactphp/reactphp

## Threat: [Event Loop Starvation](./threats/event_loop_starvation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability or intentionally craft a request or operation that causes a long-running synchronous task to execute within the main ReactPHP event loop. This blocks the event loop, making the application unresponsive to other requests and potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, leading to denial of service for legitimate users. New connections may be refused, and existing connections may time out.

**Affected Component:** `React\EventLoop\Loop` (the core event loop mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly adhere to non-blocking I/O practices.
* Offload CPU-intensive tasks to separate processes or threads using components like `react/child-process` or `react/async`.
* Implement timeouts for operations to prevent indefinite blocking.
* Monitor event loop performance and identify potential bottlenecks.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Unclosed Connections or Streams](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_unclosed_connections_or_streams.md)

**Description:** If the application fails to properly close network connections (e.g., TCP sockets, HTTP connections) or file streams after use, an attacker could intentionally trigger actions that lead to a large number of open, unused connections or streams. This can exhaust server resources (file descriptors, memory), leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Server resource exhaustion, denial of service, inability to handle new connections.

**Affected Component:** `React\Socket\ConnectionInterface`, `React\Stream\ReadableStreamInterface`, `React\Stream\WritableStreamInterface`, and specific components like `React\Http\Server` (when handling connections) or `React\Socket\Server`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper connection and stream management, ensuring resources are released when no longer needed (e.g., using `finally` blocks in Promises or `try...finally` blocks).
* Set appropriate timeouts for connections and streams.
* Monitor resource usage (e.g., open file descriptors, network connections) to detect potential leaks.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Protocol Handling on Streams](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_protocol_handling_on_streams.md)

**Description:** If the application implements custom network protocols using ReactPHP's stream components, vulnerabilities in the parsing or handling of these protocols could be exploited. An attacker could send malformed or malicious data over the stream, potentially leading to buffer overflows, injection attacks, or other security issues.

**Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** `React\Stream\ReadableStreamInterface`, `React\Stream\WritableStreamInterface`, and any custom code *within the ReactPHP application* implementing protocol handling using these interfaces.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom protocol handling.
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received from network streams.
* Implement robust error handling for protocol parsing.
* Consider using well-established and secure protocol libraries where possible.

## Threat: [Insecure WebSocket Handling (if using `react/socket`)](./threats/insecure_websocket_handling__if_using__reactsocket__.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `react/socket` for WebSocket communication, vulnerabilities in the implementation or configuration could lead to issues like cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH), where an attacker on a different website can establish a WebSocket connection to the application on behalf of a legitimate user. Other vulnerabilities might include insufficient input validation leading to injection attacks over the WebSocket.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a user, data breaches, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `React\Socket\Server` (for WebSocket servers), `React\Socket\ConnectionInterface` (for WebSocket connections).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper origin validation for WebSocket connections to prevent CSWSH.
* Sanitize and validate all data received over WebSocket connections.
* Enforce appropriate authorization and authentication for WebSocket endpoints.
