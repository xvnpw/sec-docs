# Threat Model Analysis for bagisto/bagisto

## Threat: [Malicious Extension Installation](./threats/malicious_extension_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Extension Installation

    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads or convinces an administrator to install a malicious extension from the Bagisto marketplace or a third-party source. The extension contains backdoors, data exfiltration code, or other malicious payloads, potentially disguised as a legitimate utility.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft (customer PII, payment details, order information), website defacement, denial of service, use of the server for malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Bagisto Component:** Extensions system (`packages` directory, extension loading mechanism, Admin Panel's extension management interface).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Strictly vet extensions:* Examine developer reputation, reviews, and source code (if possible).
        *   *Use a staging environment:* Test new extensions thoroughly in a non-production environment.
        *   *Regularly update extensions:* Apply security patches promptly.
        *   *Monitor file system integrity:* Detect unauthorized changes in the `packages` directory.
        *   *Limit extension permissions:* If Bagisto allows, restrict what extensions can access.
        *   *Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF):* Configure rules for known extension vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Extension](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_extension.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Extension

    *   **Description:** A legitimate, widely-used Bagisto extension is compromised at the source (developer's account hacked, repository compromised). A malicious update is distributed through Bagisto's update mechanism or manual download, leveraging the trust in the established extension.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of Bagisto installations, data theft, system control, denial of service, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Bagisto Component:** Extensions system (`packages` directory, update mechanism, Admin Panel's update functionality).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Monitor security advisories:* Stay informed about vulnerabilities.
        *   *Delay updates:* Wait a short period for community vetting before updating.
        *   *Staging environment testing:* Test updates in a staging environment.
        *   *Dependency vulnerability scanning:* Identify known vulnerabilities in extension dependencies.
        *   *Checksum verification:* Verify the integrity of downloaded packages (if possible).

## Threat: [Exploitation of Weak Default Configuration](./threats/exploitation_of_weak_default_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Weak Default Configuration

## Threat: [Admin Panel Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/admin_panel_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Admin Panel Vulnerability Exploitation

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability specific to the Bagisto admin panel (e.g., insufficient authorization, logic flaw, information disclosure). The attacker might use social engineering, brute-force, or exploit a known vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, modification of store settings, product/order manipulation, customer data theft, complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Bagisto Component:** Admin Panel (controllers, views, authentication/authorization logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Keep Bagisto updated:* Apply security patches promptly.
        *   *Strong password policies:* Enforce complex passwords.
        *   *Multi-factor authentication (MFA):* Enable MFA for admin accounts.
        *   *IP address restriction:* Limit access based on IP (if feasible).
        *   *Admin panel activity monitoring:* Review logs for suspicious behavior.
        *   *Least privilege:* Review user roles and permissions regularly.

## Threat: [API Endpoint Abuse](./threats/api_endpoint_abuse.md)

*   **Threat:** API Endpoint Abuse

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Bagisto's API endpoints (e.g., insufficient authentication, authorization flaws, lack of rate limiting). The attacker sends crafted requests to access/modify data or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service, potential for further exploitation.
    *   **Affected Bagisto Component:** API endpoints (controllers, authentication/authorization logic, API routes).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Strong API authentication and authorization:* Use API keys/tokens with appropriate permissions.
        *   *Input validation:* Validate all data received through the API.
