# Attack Surface Analysis for bagisto/bagisto

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_brute-forcecredential_stuffing.md)

*Description:* Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Bagisto admin panel by guessing passwords or using stolen credentials.
*Bagisto Contribution:* Provides a centralized admin panel (`/admin` by default) with numerous functionalities, making it a high-value target. The default path is well-known.
*Example:* An attacker uses a list of common passwords or credentials leaked from other breaches to try to log in to the `/admin` panel.
*Impact:* Complete system compromise, data theft, defacement, installation of malware, disruption of service.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all admin users.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA) for admin login.
    *   Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   Monitor server logs for failed login attempts and suspicious activity.
    *   Consider changing the default `/admin` path (security through obscurity, *not* a primary defense).
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block brute-force attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_privilege_escalation.md)

*Description:* A low-privileged admin user exploits a vulnerability to gain higher-level access within the admin panel.
*Bagisto Contribution:* Bagisto's role-based access control (RBAC) system, if flawed, could allow for privilege escalation.  This is a direct consequence of Bagisto's implementation.
*Example:* A "Marketing" role user discovers a bug in the user management section (provided by Bagisto) that allows them to modify their own role to "Administrator."
*Impact:* Similar to admin panel compromise, but potentially starting from a lower-privileged account. Data breaches, unauthorized modifications, etc.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Thoroughly test the RBAC implementation (specifically Bagisto's code) to ensure that users can only perform actions permitted by their assigned roles.
    *   Regularly audit the admin panel code (Bagisto's code) for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege: grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all admin panel forms and actions (within Bagisto's codebase).

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (Admin Panel)](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities__admin_panel_.md)

*Description:* Attackers upload malicious files through Bagisto's file upload functionalities (e.g., product images, CMS content).
*Bagisto Contribution:* Bagisto *provides* the file upload features within the admin panel for managing content and products.  The vulnerability lies in *how* Bagisto handles these uploads.
*Example:* An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as a `.jpg` image to the product image upload section (a Bagisto-provided feature). They then access the uploaded file directly via its URL, gaining code execution on the server.
*Impact:* Remote code execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Implement strict file type validation *within Bagisto's code*:
        *   Do *not* rely solely on file extensions.
        *   Use content-type sniffing and magic number checks to verify the actual file type.
        *   Consider using a library like `finfo` in PHP.
    *   Store uploaded files *outside* the web root (document root) to prevent direct execution.  This is a configuration aspect, but the upload handling is within Bagisto.
    *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks (e.g., remove `../` sequences) – this must be done within Bagisto's upload handling logic.
    *   Use a secure file storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) with appropriate access controls.  Integration with these services would be handled by Bagisto.
    *   Regularly review and update file upload handling code *within Bagisto*.
    *   Limit file sizes to reasonable limits – enforced by Bagisto's upload handling.

## Attack Surface: [Pricing/Discount Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/pricingdiscount_exploitation.md)

*Description:* Attackers manipulate pricing rules, discounts, or coupons to obtain unauthorized benefits.
*Bagisto Contribution:* Bagisto *provides* the features for managing prices, discounts, and coupons, and the logic for applying them.  The vulnerability lies in Bagisto's implementation of this logic.
*Example:* An attacker modifies the price of an item in their cart using browser developer tools before submitting the order, and Bagisto's server-side code fails to re-validate the price.
*Impact:* Financial losses, unfair pricing advantages, potential legal issues.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Perform all price calculations and discount validations on the *server-side* *within Bagisto's code*. *Never* trust client-side data.
    *   Implement strict validation rules for coupon codes and discount applications *within Bagisto's logic*.
    *   Limit coupon usage (e.g., one-time use, per-customer limits, expiration dates) – enforced by Bagisto.
    *   Regularly audit pricing and discount configurations *and the Bagisto code that handles them*.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured API Endpoints (if exposed)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_api_endpoints__if_exposed_.md)

*Description:* Bagisto's API, if exposed without proper authentication and authorization, can be abused.
*Bagisto Contribution:* Bagisto *provides* and *defines* the API endpoints.  The security of these endpoints is directly tied to Bagisto's implementation.
*Example:* An attacker discovers an unauthenticated API endpoint (provided by Bagisto) that allows them to retrieve a list of all customer orders, including sensitive personal information.
*Impact:* Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for other attacks.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (can be Critical depending on the exposed data)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Require authentication for *all* API endpoints *within Bagisto's code*.
    *   Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) – implemented within Bagisto.
    *   Implement granular authorization checks *within Bagisto's API logic* to ensure that users can only access the data and perform the actions they are permitted to.
    *   Implement rate limiting *within Bagisto's API handling* to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Regularly audit API security *of Bagisto's API implementation*.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*Description:* Bagisto, and its extensions, rely on third-party libraries that may contain vulnerabilities.
*Bagisto Contribution:* Uses Laravel and other PHP packages, which may have known vulnerabilities.
*Example:* A known vulnerability in a Laravel component used by Bagisto allows for remote code execution.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from data breaches to complete system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   Regularly update Bagisto and all its dependencies (including Laravel and other packages) to the latest versions.
    *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `composer audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the used dependencies.
