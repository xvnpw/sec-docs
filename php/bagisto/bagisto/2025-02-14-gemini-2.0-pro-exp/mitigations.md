# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bagisto/bagisto

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates (Core, Extensions, Laravel within Bagisto Context)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates__core__extensions__laravel_within_bagisto_context_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Maintain a consistent update schedule, specifically using Bagisto's update mechanisms.

**Description:**
1.  **Staging Environment (Bagisto Instance):** Create a duplicate *Bagisto* instance for testing.
2.  **Monitor Bagisto Channels:**  Focus on Bagisto's official channels: GitHub releases, security advisories, blog, and extension developer updates *within the Bagisto ecosystem*.
3.  **Composer within Bagisto:** Use Composer *within the Bagisto project directory* (`composer update`) to update the Bagisto core, installed extensions, and the underlying Laravel framework. This ensures Bagisto's specific dependencies are managed correctly.
4.  **Bagisto-Specific Testing:** After updating in the staging *Bagisto* instance, perform comprehensive testing, focusing on Bagisto's features:
    *   **Bagisto Functional Testing:** Verify all core *Bagisto* e-commerce features (product management, category management, order processing, customer accounts, Bagisto admin panel, etc.).
    *   **Bagisto Regression Testing:** Ensure existing *Bagisto* customizations and integrations (custom themes, modules) still work.
    *   **Bagisto Security Testing:** Perform basic security checks within Bagisto (try XSS in Bagisto's search, check for exposed data in Bagisto's output).
5.  **Deploy to Production (Bagisto Instance):** Deploy the updated *Bagisto* code.
6.  **Bagisto Backups:** Create full backups (code and *Bagisto database*) before updates.

**Threats Mitigated:**
