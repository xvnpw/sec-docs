**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Context-Aware Output Encoding in Bagisto Templates

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize Bagisto's Blade Engine:** Leverage Laravel's Blade templating engine within Bagisto and its built-in escaping mechanisms (`{{ }}`). Bagisto templates use Blade.
2.  **Escape Bagisto User Content:** Always escape user-generated content displayed in Bagisto templates (product descriptions, reviews, customer names, etc.) using `{{ }}` for HTML context to prevent XSS in Bagisto.
3.  **Raw Output in Bagisto (Use with Caution):** If raw HTML output is needed in Bagisto templates (e.g., for rich text), use `{!! !!}` with extreme caution. Sanitize data before raw output in Bagisto.
4.  **Context-Specific Bagisto Encoding:** Be mindful of output context in Bagisto templates:
    *   **HTML in Bagisto:** Use `{{ }}` (default HTML escaping).
    *   **JavaScript in Bagisto:** Use `@json()` Blade directive or `json_encode()` in PHP for safe JavaScript embedding in Bagisto.
    *   **URLs in Bagisto:** Use `urlencode()` or Laravel's `URL::encode()` for URL encoding in Bagisto templates.
5.  **Review Bagisto Templates:** Regularly review Bagisto Blade templates to ensure proper output encoding is applied, especially when modifying or adding new Bagisto templates.
6.  **Sanitize Bagisto Database Data:** Sanitize data from the Bagisto database before displaying it in templates, even with input validation, to prevent XSS in Bagisto.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
