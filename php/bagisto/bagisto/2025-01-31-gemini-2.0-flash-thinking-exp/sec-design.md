# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Laravel framework security features (CSRF protection, protection against SQL injection, etc.) - Implemented within the Laravel framework itself.
  - security control: Input validation and sanitization - Expected to be implemented throughout the application codebase, especially in controllers and models.
  - security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms - Implemented using Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features, likely customized for e-commerce roles (admin, customer, etc.).
  - security control: HTTPS encryption - Expected to be configured for production deployments, typically at the web server or load balancer level.
  - security control: Regular security updates for Laravel and dependencies - Responsibility of the platform maintainers and users to apply updates.
  - security control: Code reviews -  Likely practiced by the development team, especially for core platform changes.
  - security control: Security testing (basic) -  Likely performed by the development team, potentially including unit and integration tests with some security considerations.

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk:  Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party packages - Risk mitigated by dependency scanning and regular updates, but not fully eliminated.
  - accepted risk:  Configuration errors leading to security weaknesses - Risk mitigated by documentation and best practices, but relies on user diligence.
  - accepted risk:  Slow adoption of security patches by users -  Risk inherent in open-source software, mitigated by clear communication and update mechanisms.
  - accepted risk:  Social engineering attacks targeting administrators - Risk mitigated by security awareness training and strong account security practices.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
  - security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Implement Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing by security professionals to assess the platform's security posture.
  - security control: Implement a robust security incident response plan.
  - security control:  Enhance logging and monitoring for security events and anomalies.
  - security control:  Implement database encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data.
  - security control:  Strengthen access control mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication for administrators.
  - security control:  Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
  - security control:  Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Dependabot or similar.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure user authentication for administrators and customers.
    - Requirement: Support for strong password policies and password reset mechanisms.
    - Requirement: Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts.
    - Requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks on login forms (rate limiting, account lockout).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for administrators and different user roles.
    - Requirement: Ensure proper authorization checks are in place before granting access to resources and functionalities.
    - Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to user roles and permissions.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    - Requirement: Server-side validation should be enforced, not relying solely on client-side validation.
    - Requirement: Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys.
    - Requirement: Implement HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
