# Threat Model Analysis for bagisto/bagisto

## Threat: [Insecure Default Credentials](./threats/insecure_default_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the Bagisto admin panel using default credentials (if not changed during installation). If successful, they gain full administrative control over the Bagisto platform.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the e-commerce platform, including access to customer data, order information, and the ability to modify website content and settings.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Installer Module`, `Admin Authentication System` (within Bagisto)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Force users to change default credentials during the initial setup process within Bagisto.
        *   Provide clear documentation within Bagisto's documentation on the importance of changing default credentials.
        *   Implement checks within Bagisto's login to warn users if default credentials are still in use.

## Threat: [Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Exploitation](./threats/insufficient_role-based_access_control__rbac__exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially a compromised internal user or someone who gained unauthorized access with limited privileges within Bagisto, could exploit overly permissive RBAC configurations to access functionalities or data beyond their intended scope within the Bagisto admin panel. They might escalate their privileges or access sensitive information managed by Bagisto.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by Bagisto, modification of critical Bagisto settings, or execution of privileged actions within the Bagisto platform.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Admin RBAC Module`, `User Management Module`, `Permission System` (within Bagisto)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations within Bagisto to ensure the principle of least privilege is enforced.
        *   Provide granular permission settings for different administrative roles within Bagisto.
        *   Log and monitor user actions within the Bagisto admin panel to detect suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Extension Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_extension_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Extension Code
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution) present in poorly coded or outdated third-party extensions *integrated with Bagisto*. They could leverage these vulnerabilities to inject malicious scripts, gain database access to Bagisto's data, or execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Bagisto.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data breaches of Bagisto data, website defacement of the Bagisto storefront, malware distribution through the Bagisto platform, and server compromise affecting the Bagisto installation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Extension Management Module` (within Bagisto), specific vulnerable `Third-Party Extension Modules` (integrated with Bagisto)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit third-party extensions before installation within Bagisto.
        *   Only install extensions from trusted sources compatible with the Bagisto version.
        *   Keep all installed extensions updated to the latest secure versions compatible with the Bagisto version.
        *   Implement a process for monitoring security advisories for installed extensions within the Bagisto ecosystem.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Payment Gateway Integration](./threats/insecure_handling_of_payment_gateway_integration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of Payment Gateway Integration
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in *Bagisto's* integration with payment gateways (if not implemented securely by Bagisto developers) to intercept or manipulate payment information during transactions processed through the Bagisto platform. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks targeting the communication between Bagisto and the gateway or exploiting flaws in Bagisto's integration logic.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss for customers using the Bagisto platform and the business operating the Bagisto store, potential legal repercussions for the Bagisto store owner, and damage to the reputation of the Bagisto platform and the store.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Payment Module`, specific `Payment Gateway Integration Modules` (within Bagisto)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize reputable and PCI DSS compliant payment gateways *that are securely integrated with Bagisto*.
        *   Ensure the Bagisto integration follows the payment gateway's security best practices.
        *   Implement secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for all payment-related transactions within the Bagisto platform.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive payment information directly within the Bagisto application's database.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Panel Input Fields](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_admin_panel_input_fields.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Admin Panel Input Fields
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields within the Bagisto admin panel (e.g., product descriptions, category names managed by Bagisto). When an administrator views this content through the Bagisto admin interface, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the administrator within the Bagisto platform.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover of administrative users of the Bagisto platform, leading to full platform compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Admin UI Components`, specific `Input Fields` within admin modules (e.g., `Catalog Module`, `CMS Module` within Bagisto)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all data displayed within the Bagisto admin panel.
        *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources when accessing the Bagisto admin panel.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Functionality](./threats/insecure_file_upload_functionality.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Upload Functionality
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Bagisto's file upload features (e.g., for product images, attachments managed by Bagisto) to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells). If these files are not properly validated and stored by Bagisto, the attacker could execute them on the server hosting Bagisto, gaining remote access.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting Bagisto, leading to full server compromise, data breaches of Bagisto data, and website defacement of the Bagisto storefront.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Media Manager Module`, specific `File Upload Components` in various modules (e.g., `Catalog Module`, `CMS Module` within Bagisto)
