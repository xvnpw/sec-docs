# Attack Surface Analysis for bagisto/bagisto

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Admin Login Panel](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_admin_login_panel.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Unprotected Admin Login Panel
    - **Description:** The admin login panel lacks sufficient protection against brute-force attacks and may not enforce strong password policies or multi-factor authentication by default.
    - **How Bagisto Contributes:** Bagisto's admin panel provides privileged access to manage the entire store. Weak protection here allows attackers to gain full control of the Bagisto instance.
    - **Example:** Attackers use automated tools to try common username/password combinations or brute-force passwords against the admin login form specific to Bagisto.
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Bagisto store, including customer data, financial information, and the ability to manipulate products and orders.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms specifically for the Bagisto admin panel. Enforce strong password policies within the Bagisto application. Integrate multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a standard feature for Bagisto admin accounts.
        - **Users:** Enable MFA for all Bagisto admin accounts. Use strong, unique passwords for Bagisto admin users. Regularly review and restrict admin user access within the Bagisto configuration. Consider IP whitelisting specifically for Bagisto admin access.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads in Product Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads_in_product_management.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Insecure File Uploads in Product Management
    - **Description:** The ability to upload files (e.g., product images) in the admin panel without proper validation can allow attackers to upload malicious files, such as web shells, directly through Bagisto's interface.
    - **How Bagisto Contributes:** Bagisto's product management features allow administrators to upload images and potentially other file types. Insufficient validation within Bagisto at this stage introduces the risk of malicious uploads.
    - **Example:** An attacker with compromised Bagisto admin credentials uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image through the Bagisto product upload form. They can then access this shell to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Bagisto.
    - **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach originating from the Bagisto installation, website defacement, malware distribution through the Bagisto platform.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation within Bagisto based on content, not just extension, for all file uploads in the admin panel. Store uploaded files outside the web root accessible by Bagisto and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism. Integrate malware scanning for files uploaded through Bagisto.
        - **Users:** Restrict Bagisto admin access to trusted personnel. Regularly review files uploaded through the Bagisto admin interface. Ensure the server environment hosting Bagisto has appropriate file execution permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Extensions/Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_extensionsmodules.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Extensions/Modules
    - **Description:** Bagisto's modular architecture relies on extensions, and vulnerabilities in these third-party components can introduce security flaws directly into the Bagisto application.
    - **How Bagisto Contributes:** Bagisto's core design encourages the use of extensions, making its security posture dependent on the security of these external components. Bagisto's marketplace or installation process might not have rigorous security checks for all extensions.
    - **Example:** A vulnerable payment gateway extension specifically designed for Bagisto allows attackers to intercept or manipulate payment information processed through the Bagisto checkout.
    - **Impact:** Data breach of customer information handled by Bagisto, financial loss due to compromised transactions within Bagisto, compromise of core Bagisto store functionality.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Provide clear security guidelines and best practices specifically for Bagisto extension developers. Implement a mechanism for security reviews of popular Bagisto extensions within the Bagisto ecosystem.
        - **Users:** Carefully vet Bagisto extensions before installing them, focusing on reputation and security practices of the developers. Only install Bagisto extensions from trusted sources. Keep all Bagisto extensions updated to the latest versions. Regularly review installed Bagisto extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or supported.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Search Functionality](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_search_functionality.md)

- **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection in Search Functionality
    - **Description:** Improperly sanitized user input in Bagisto's search functionality can allow attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the database used by Bagisto.
    - **How Bagisto Contributes:** Bagisto's search feature takes user input and uses it to construct and execute database queries. If Bagisto's code doesn't properly sanitize this input, it can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities within the Bagisto application.
    - **Example:** A user enters a search term like `' OR '1'='1` into the Bagisto search bar, which, if not sanitized by Bagisto, could bypass authentication checks within Bagisto or retrieve sensitive data from Bagisto's database.
    - **Impact:** Data breach of information stored in Bagisto's database, unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by Bagisto, potential for data manipulation or deletion within the Bagisto system.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions within Bagisto involving user input from the search functionality. Implement input validation and sanitization specifically within Bagisto's search processing logic to prevent malicious SQL syntax.
        - **Users:** Ensure your Bagisto installation is updated to the latest version with security patches addressing potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Endpoints (if exposed by Bagisto)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_endpoints__if_exposed_by_bagisto_.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Insecure API Endpoints (if exposed by Bagisto)
    - **Description:** API endpoints specifically exposed by Bagisto, if not properly secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms, can be vulnerable to unauthorized access and data manipulation targeting Bagisto's data and functionality.
    - **How Bagisto Contributes:** Bagisto may expose API endpoints for specific functionalities it offers. If these Bagisto-specific endpoints lack proper security measures, they become direct attack vectors against the Bagisto application.
    - **Example:** An unauthenticated Bagisto API endpoint allows anyone to retrieve customer data managed by Bagisto or modify product prices within the Bagisto catalog.
    - **Impact:** Data breach of information managed by Bagisto, unauthorized access to sensitive information within the Bagisto system, manipulation of store data and functionality specific to Bagisto.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints exposed by Bagisto. Enforce input validation and sanitization for data received by Bagisto's API endpoints. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of Bagisto's API.
        - **Users:** If utilizing Bagisto's API, ensure proper authentication and authorization are configured according to Bagisto's documentation. Limit API access to necessary clients and services interacting with Bagisto.
