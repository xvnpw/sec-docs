## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Bagisto Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_bagisto_application.md)

* This is the overarching goal and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the Bagisto application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_known_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in specific versions of Bagisto.
* **Mechanism:** They identify the Bagisto version being used and search for corresponding CVEs. Exploit code is often readily available, making this a relatively low-effort attack for those with basic technical skills.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Defaults or Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_insecure_defaults_or_configurations.md)

* This node represents the exploitation of weaknesses stemming from default settings or misconfigurations within the Bagisto application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Default Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__default_admin_credentials.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to the Bagisto admin panel using default or commonly used administrator credentials (e.g., "admin," "password").
* **Mechanism:** This is a straightforward brute-force or dictionary attack targeting the login form.
* **Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker full administrative control over the Bagisto application, allowing them to manipulate data, install malicious extensions, and potentially gain access to the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Bagisto Extension/Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_bagisto_extensionmodule_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node focuses on vulnerabilities present within Bagisto's extension or module ecosystem.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Bagisto Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_bagisto_extensions.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within extensions developed by third-party developers.
* **Mechanism:** This involves analyzing the code of third-party extensions for common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), or insecure direct object references (IDOR).
* **Impact:** The impact depends on the vulnerability and the privileges of the vulnerable extension. It can range from data breaches and account compromise to full application takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Extension](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_extension.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers introduce malicious code into the Bagisto application by uploading or installing a seemingly legitimate but compromised extension.
* **Mechanism:** This could involve compromising a legitimate extension developer's account or creating a fake extension with malicious intent.
* **Impact:**  A malicious extension can have a wide range of impacts, including installing backdoors, stealing sensitive data, redirecting users, or completely compromising the application and server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Admin Panel](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__compromise_admin_panel.md)

* This node represents the successful gaining of unauthorized access to the Bagisto administrative interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Credential Stuffing](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__credential_stuffing.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers use lists of compromised usernames and passwords (often obtained from breaches of other websites or services) to attempt to log in to the Bagisto admin panel.
* **Mechanism:** Automated tools are typically used to try these credential pairs against the login form.
* **Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker full administrative control over the Bagisto application.
