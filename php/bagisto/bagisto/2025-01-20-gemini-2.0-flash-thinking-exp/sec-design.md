# Project Design Document: Bagisto E-commerce Platform

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced and more detailed design overview of the Bagisto e-commerce platform (as represented by the codebase at [https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto)). This iteration aims to provide a more granular understanding of the system's architecture, specifically tailored for effective threat modeling. It expands on the previous version by providing more detail on component interactions, data flows, and potential security considerations.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of the Bagisto project remain to provide a comprehensive and customizable open-source e-commerce platform. Key objectives include:

*   Empowering merchants to design and manage diverse online storefronts.
*   Delivering an intuitive and efficient shopping experience for end-users.
*   Supporting a wide array of product types, hierarchical categories, and customizable attributes.
*   Streamlining order lifecycle management, secure payment processing, and flexible shipping options.
*   Offering integrated marketing and promotional functionalities.
*   Maintaining a scalable and extensible architecture to accommodate growth and customization.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

Bagisto adheres to a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, built upon the robust Laravel PHP framework. The following diagram illustrates the high-level interaction between the core components.

## 5. Data Flow (Detailed Scenarios)

This section outlines more specific data flow scenarios.

*   **Customer Browsing a Product:**
    1. Customer clicks on a product link in their browser.
    2. The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the web server.
    3. The load balancer routes the request to an available web server.
    4. The web server passes the request to the `ProductController`.
    5. The `ProductController` retrieves product data from the database via the `Product` model, potentially using the cache.
    6. The `ProductController` may also retrieve related data like category information and product images.
    7. The `ProductController` passes the data to the appropriate Blade template.
    8. The Blade template renders the HTML for the product detail page.
    9. The web server sends the HTML response back to the customer's browser.
    10. The browser renders the page and may request additional assets (images, CSS, JS).

*   **Customer Placing an Order:**
    1. Customer adds products to their shopping cart.
    2. Customer proceeds to the checkout.
    3. The browser sends form data (shipping address, payment details) via an HTTP POST request.
    4. The `CheckoutController` receives the request.
    5. The `CheckoutController` validates the input data.
    6. The `CheckoutController` interacts with the `PaymentService` to process the payment.
    7. Upon successful payment, the `CheckoutController` creates a new `Order` record in the database, including `OrderItem` records.
    8. The `CheckoutController` interacts with the `ShippingService` to calculate shipping costs and potentially create a shipment.
    9. The `OrderWasPlaced` event is triggered.
    10. Listeners to this event (e.g., sending order confirmation email, updating inventory) are executed.
    11. The `CheckoutController` redirects the customer to an order confirmation page.

*   **Admin Updating Product Inventory:**
    1. Admin logs into the admin panel.
    2. Admin navigates to the product management section.
    3. Admin edits the inventory for a specific product.
    4. The browser sends an HTTP POST request to the `AdminProductController`.
    5. The `AdminProductController` validates the input.
    6. The `AdminProductController` updates the inventory information in the database via the `Product` and `InventorySource` models.
    7. The `AdminProductController` may clear relevant cache entries.
    8. The `AdminProductController` redirects the admin back to the product management page.

## 6. Security Considerations (Enhanced)

This section expands on potential security areas, providing more specific examples.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Threat:** Brute-force attacks on login forms, weak password policies, session hijacking, privilege escalation.
    *   **Considerations:** Implement strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), rate limiting on login attempts, secure session management (HTTPOnly, Secure flags), role-based access control (RBAC).
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Threat:** SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, path traversal.
    *   **Considerations:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs on both the client-side and server-side, use parameterized queries for database interactions, escape output data appropriately.
*   **Data Protection:**
    *   **Threat:** Exposure of sensitive data (customer PII, payment information) in transit and at rest.
    *   **Considerations:** Use HTTPS for all communication, encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database, avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily, comply with PCI DSS for payment data handling.
*   **Session Management:**
    *   **Threat:** Session fixation, session hijacking.
    *   **Considerations:** Generate strong and unpredictable session IDs, regenerate session IDs after login, set appropriate session timeouts, use secure session cookies.
*   **Payment Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, storage of sensitive payment data, vulnerabilities in payment gateway integrations.
    *   **Considerations:** Utilize secure payment gateways, avoid storing sensitive payment data locally, implement tokenization, ensure PCI DSS compliance.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threat:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
    *   **Considerations:** Regularly update dependencies, use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities.
*   **File Upload Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Uploading malicious files (e.g., web shells).
    *   **Considerations:** Validate file types and sizes, sanitize file names, store uploaded files outside the webroot, use virus scanning.
*   **API Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to API endpoints, data breaches through API vulnerabilities.
    *   **Considerations:** Implement authentication and authorization for API endpoints (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0), rate limiting, input validation.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.
    *   **Considerations:** Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests.
*   **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to resources from different origins.
    *   **Considerations:** Configure CORS headers appropriately to restrict cross-origin requests.

## 7. Deployment Architecture (Variations)

Beyond the standard cloud deployment, other variations exist:

*   **On-Premise Deployment:** Hosting Bagisto on the merchant's own infrastructure.
*   **Containerized Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes):** Deploying Bagisto within containers for scalability and portability.
*   **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):** Utilizing platforms like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk for simplified deployment and management.
*   **Headless Commerce:** Decoupling the frontend from the backend, allowing for different frontend implementations (e.g., mobile apps, PWAs).
