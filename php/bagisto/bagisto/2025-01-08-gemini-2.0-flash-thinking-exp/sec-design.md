## 7. Data Flow Scenarios

This section outlines key data flow scenarios within the Bagisto platform.

*   **Customer Browsing Products:**
    1. A customer sends a request to view product listings from their **Customer Web Browser** to the **Nginx/Apache Web Server**.
    2. The **Web Server** forwards the request to **PHP-FPM**.
    3. The **Laravel Framework** routes the request to the appropriate controller in the **Bagisto Core Application** (**Storefront**).
    4. The **Bagisto Core** retrieves product data from the **MySQL/MariaDB Database**, potentially utilizing **Redis/Memcached** for cached data.
    5. The **Laravel Framework** renders the product listing view using the **Blade** templating engine.
    6. The rendered HTML is sent back through the **Web Server** to the **Customer Web Browser**.
    7. The **Customer Web Browser** may request static assets (images) from the **Web Server**.

*   **Admin User Creating a New Product:**
    1. An administrator interacts with the **Admin Panel** in their **Admin Web Browser**.
    2. The browser sends a request to create a new product to the **Nginx/Apache Web Server**.
    3. The **Web Server** forwards the request to **PHP-FPM**.
    4. The **Laravel Framework** routes the request to the appropriate controller in the **Bagisto Core Application** (**Admin Panel**).
    5. The **Bagisto Core** validates the input data.
    6. Product data is stored in the **MySQL/MariaDB Database**.
    7. If images are uploaded, they are stored in **File Storage**.
