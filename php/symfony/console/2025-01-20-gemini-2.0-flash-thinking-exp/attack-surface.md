# Attack Surface Analysis for symfony/console

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user_input.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject arbitrary shell commands into arguments or options of console commands, leading to unauthorized code execution on the server.

**How Console Contributes:** The console component is designed to accept user input as arguments and options for commands. If this input is not properly sanitized before being used in system calls or other executable commands, it creates an entry point for command injection.

**Example:** A console command `app:process-file --path=/path/to/user/provided/file` could be vulnerable if the `--path` value is not sanitized. An attacker could provide `--path="file.txt; rm -rf /"` leading to the execution of `rm -rf /`.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data loss, service disruption, and potential lateral movement within the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it in any system calls or executable commands. Use escaping functions specific to the shell environment.
*   **Avoid Direct Shell Execution:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly executing shell commands with user input. Use built-in PHP functions or libraries that provide the necessary functionality without invoking the shell.
*   **Parameter Binding/Placeholders:** If interacting with external processes, use parameter binding or placeholders to prevent the interpretation of special characters as commands.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run console commands with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Input](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_input.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate file paths provided as input to console commands to access or modify files outside the intended scope.

**How Console Contributes:** Console commands often interact with the file system, accepting file paths as arguments or options. If these paths are not properly validated, attackers can use ".." sequences or absolute paths to access sensitive files.

**Example:** A command `app:view-log --file=var/log/app.log` could be exploited by providing `--file=../../../../etc/passwd` to access the system's password file.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, modification of critical system files, and potential for further exploitation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Path Validation:** Implement strict validation of file paths. Ensure they are within the expected directory and do not contain ".." sequences or unexpected absolute paths.
*   **Canonicalization:** Use functions to resolve the canonical (absolute) path of the input and compare it against the allowed paths.
*   **Chroot Environment (Advanced):** In highly sensitive environments, consider running console commands within a chroot environment to restrict file system access.

## Attack Surface: [Execution with Elevated Privileges](./attack_surfaces/execution_with_elevated_privileges.md)

**Description:** Console commands are executed with unnecessarily high privileges, increasing the potential impact of a successful attack.

**How Console Contributes:** The environment in which the console command is executed determines its privileges. If the command is run as root or with other elevated privileges, any vulnerability can be exploited with greater impact.

**Example:** A vulnerable console command run as root could allow an attacker to gain full control of the server.

**Impact:** Full system compromise if the command is run with root privileges.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run console commands with the minimum necessary privileges required for their operation. Create dedicated user accounts with limited permissions for running console applications.
*   **Avoid Root Execution:**  Never run console commands as the root user unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
*   **Containerization:** Use containerization technologies (like Docker) to isolate console applications and limit their access to the host system.
