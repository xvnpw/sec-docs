# Threat Model Analysis for symfony/console

## Threat: [Command Injection](./threats/command_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input sanitization in command arguments or options provided to a Symfony Console command. This allows the attacker to inject shell metacharacters or commands into user-provided input, which is then directly passed to a shell command execution function (e.g., `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `proc_open`). This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, installation of malware, unauthorized access to resources.

**Affected Component:**
* `Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputArgument` (when processing arguments)
* `Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputOption` (when processing options)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data (arguments and options) received by Symfony Console commands.
* Avoid using shell execution functions (`exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `proc_open`) with user-provided input received through the Symfony Console if possible.
* If shell execution is necessary, use parameterized commands or escape shell metacharacters properly using functions like `escapeshellarg()` and `escapeshellcmd()` on input received from the Symfony Console.
* Prefer using PHP's built-in functions or libraries for specific tasks instead of relying on external shell commands within Symfony Console command logic.

## Threat: [Argument/Option Injection leading to unintended actions](./threats/argumentoption_injection_leading_to_unintended_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates command arguments or options processed by a Symfony Console command to alter its intended behavior in a harmful way. This could involve providing unexpected values, types, or combinations of arguments/options that bypass security checks or trigger unintended functionality within the command's logic.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access to data managed by the command, denial of service by triggering resource-intensive operations, bypassing intended security restrictions implemented within the Symfony Console command.

**Affected Component:**
* `Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputDefinition` (defining allowed arguments and options for Symfony Console commands)
* `Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputInterface` (accessing input values within Symfony Console commands)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Define strict allowed values and formats for arguments and options within the Symfony Console command definition using validation rules.
* Implement thorough validation logic within the Symfony Console command's execution to ensure arguments and options are within expected boundaries and combinations.
* Avoid relying solely on the presence or absence of options for critical security decisions within Symfony Console commands.
* Sanitize and type-cast input values received by Symfony Console commands to prevent unexpected data types from causing issues.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization (if user input is involved)](./threats/insecure_deserialization__if_user_input_is_involved_.md)

**Description:** If a Symfony Console command deserializes user-provided data (e.g., from arguments or options) without proper sanitization, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server (Object Injection). While not strictly a vulnerability *of* the console component itself, the console can be a vector for this attack.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise.

**Affected Component:**
* Potentially `Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputArgument` or `Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputOption` if they are used to pass serialized data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing untrusted data received through Symfony Console commands.
* If deserialization is absolutely necessary for data received by a Symfony Console command, use secure alternatives like JSON or implement robust signature verification to ensure the integrity and origin of the serialized data.
* Keep PHP and all dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Symfony Console](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_symfony_console.md)

**Description:** The `symfony/console` component itself might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution affecting applications using the component.

**Affected Component:**
* The `symfony/console` component.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `symfony/console` component updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
* Regularly review security advisories for Symfony and update the component promptly when vulnerabilities are announced.
* Subscribe to security mailing lists or notifications for Symfony to stay informed about potential issues.
* Use tools like `composer audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in the `symfony/console` dependency.
