## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Symfony Console (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_symfony_console__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. It signifies a successful breach of the application's security by leveraging vulnerabilities within the Symfony Console component.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Console Command (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_console_command__critical_node_.md)

This is the core action the attacker needs to achieve to compromise the application via the console. It involves successfully running a command that performs actions detrimental to the application's security or integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Command Injection (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_command_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack vector involves directly injecting malicious commands that are then executed by the console. This typically occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in console command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Configuration File Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/via_configuration_file_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can modify configuration files (e.g., YAML, XML, PHP arrays) to inject malicious commands that will be executed when the console application parses these files. This can happen if the application has vulnerabilities like insecure file permissions or file inclusion issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Command Execution via Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_command_execution_via_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

Instead of directly injecting commands, attackers manipulate configuration settings to indirectly trigger the execution of malicious commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Command Name or Arguments in Configuration Files (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_command_name_or_arguments_in_configuration_files__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target configuration files to alter the command being executed or its arguments. This can involve changing the command name to a malicious one or injecting harmful parameters into legitimate commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit YAML/XML/PHP Deserialization Vulnerability (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_yamlxmlphp_deserialization_vulnerability__high-risk_path_.md)

If the application uses deserialization to process configuration files (especially YAML, XML, or serialized PHP objects), attackers can craft malicious payloads that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server, effectively leading to command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Command Execution via Database (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_command_execution_via_database__high-risk_path_.md)

If the application stores command names or arguments in a database and the console retrieves this data, attackers can exploit database vulnerabilities to inject malicious commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Command via SQL Injection (if console uses DB for commands) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_command_via_sql_injection__if_console_uses_db_for_commands___critical_node_.md)

Attackers exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities to insert malicious command strings into database records that are later used by the console application to construct and execute commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Console Component Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_console_component_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This involves directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the Symfony Console library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Symfony Console Library (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_symfony_console_library__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of the Symfony Console component. If the application is using an outdated or vulnerable version, attackers can use readily available exploits to compromise the application.
