# Attack Surface Analysis for symfony/console

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system by manipulating input that is later executed by the console application.
    *   **How Console Contributes:** Console commands often take user-provided arguments or options which, if not properly sanitized, can be passed directly to shell commands using functions like `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `proc_open()`, or the backtick operator.
    *   **Example:** A console command takes a filename as an argument: `my-command --file="report.txt"`. A malicious user could provide `--file="report.txt && rm -rf /"` leading to the execution of `rm -rf /`.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data loss, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided input before using it in system commands. Use escaping functions specific to the shell (e.g., `escapeshellarg()` or `escapeshellcmd()` in PHP).
        *   **Avoid Shell Execution:** If possible, avoid executing external shell commands altogether. Use PHP's built-in functions for file manipulation, etc.
        *   **Parameterization:** When interacting with external tools, use parameterized commands or libraries that handle escaping automatically.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run console commands with the minimum necessary user privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal
    *   **Description:** An attacker can access files or directories outside of the intended scope by manipulating file paths provided as input to console commands.
    *   **How Console Contributes:** Console commands frequently handle file paths as arguments or options for reading, writing, or processing files. If these paths are not validated, attackers can use sequences like `../` to navigate the file system.
    *   **Example:** A console command processes a file specified by the user: `process-file --path="data/input.txt"`. A malicious user could provide `--path="../../../../../etc/passwd"` to access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files, potential for arbitrary file read/write depending on the command's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all file paths provided by users. Ensure they are within the expected directory structure.
        *   **Canonicalization:** Use functions like `realpath()` to resolve symbolic links and relative paths to their absolute canonical form for comparison and validation.
        *   **Whitelist Known Paths:** If possible, only allow access to a predefined set of allowed paths.
        *   **Sandboxing:** If the console command needs to interact with the file system extensively, consider running it within a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Commands](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_commands.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Custom Commands
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities are introduced through poorly written or insecure custom console commands developed for the application.
    *   **How Console Contributes:** The Symfony Console component provides a framework for creating custom commands. If developers do not follow secure coding practices when creating these commands, they can introduce various vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A custom command interacts with an external API using hardcoded credentials or without proper error handling, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability introduced in the custom command, including data breaches, system compromise, or application malfunction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices for console commands, including input validation, output encoding, and secure handling of external resources.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom console commands to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Ensure that any third-party libraries used in custom commands are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Include custom console commands in regular security audits and penetration testing.
