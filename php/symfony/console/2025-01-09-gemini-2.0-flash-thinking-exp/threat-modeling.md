# Threat Model Analysis for symfony/console

## Threat: [Malicious Command Arguments](./threats/malicious_command_arguments.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious arguments when executing console commands. This could involve injecting shell commands within arguments intended for system calls, providing unexpected data types that trigger vulnerabilities within the console component's argument handling, or supplying excessively long strings to cause buffer overflows (if the command logic using the input is vulnerable).

**Impact:** Potentially leads to remote code execution with the privileges of the user running the command, data breaches if the command interacts with sensitive data, or denial of service by crashing the application or the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** Input argument parsing (within the `Input` component and how command arguments are handled in the `Command` class).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation for all command arguments, including type checking, length limits, and allowed character sets within the command's logic.
* Avoid directly using user-provided input in system commands. Use functions like `escapeshellarg()` or dedicated libraries for secure command execution if necessary.
* Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks.
* Consider using argument type hinting and validation provided by Symfony's Console component.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Console Commands](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_console_commands.md)

**Description:** If console commands are designed or configured to perform actions with elevated privileges (e.g., interacting with system services or sensitive files), vulnerabilities in the command logic, particularly how it utilizes the Symfony Console's input and output mechanisms, could allow an attacker with lower privileges to execute these privileged operations. This could happen if input validation is missing or flawed, allowing manipulation of the command's behavior through the console interface.

**Impact:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources, modify system configurations, or perform actions they are not normally authorized to do.

**Affected Component:** Command execution logic within the `Command` class and potentially the `Application` class if it manages command execution flow.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Run console commands with the least necessary privileges.
* Thoroughly audit and test commands that perform privileged operations, paying close attention to how they interact with the Console component.
* Implement strict authorization checks within the command logic to ensure the user has the necessary permissions before performing privileged actions initiated through the console.
* Consider using separate scripts or tools for privileged operations with tighter access controls, minimizing reliance on the console for such actions.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Unsafe Command Generation](./threats/code_injection_via_unsafe_command_generation.md)

**Description:** If command logic dynamically constructs and executes other commands based on user input received through the Symfony Console without proper sanitization, it could lead to code injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate the input provided to the console to inject arbitrary code into the generated command.

**Impact:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running the command, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Command execution logic within the `Command` class where external commands are dynamically generated and executed, utilizing input from the `Input` component.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid dynamically generating and executing commands based on untrusted input received via the console.
* If dynamic command generation is absolutely necessary, use parameterized commands or secure command construction methods that prevent injection (e.g., using libraries that handle escaping).
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data received through the console that is used to construct commands.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration via Command Options](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_via_command_options.md)

**Description:** Sensitive configuration values (e.g., API keys, database passwords) might be passed directly as command-line options when invoking a Symfony Console command. These options could be visible in process listings or command history, potentially exposing them to unauthorized users. The Symfony Console itself handles the parsing and passing of these options.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to access protected resources or systems.

**Affected Component:** Input argument handling within the `Input` component and how command options are defined in the `Command` class.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid passing sensitive information directly as command-line options when using Symfony Console commands.
* Utilize secure configuration management techniques (e.g., environment variables, dedicated configuration files with restricted access) that are not directly passed through the console.
* Consider using input methods that don't expose sensitive data in command history (e.g., prompting for passwords within the command's logic, not as an option).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Command Execution](./threats/unauthorized_command_execution.md)

**Description:** Lack of proper access control mechanisms within the application using the Symfony Console could allow unauthorized users or processes to execute sensitive console commands. This is a direct consequence of not implementing authorization checks when a command is invoked through the console.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application functionalities, potential data manipulation, or execution of privileged operations by malicious actors.

**Affected Component:** The `Application` class responsible for managing command execution and potentially custom logic implemented within the application to control access to commands.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms specifically for Symfony Console commands within your application.
* Restrict access to command execution based on user roles or permissions.
* Consider using Symfony's security component or other authorization libraries to control command access.

## Threat: [Compromised Command Definitions](./threats/compromised_command_definitions.md)

**Description:** If the files defining console commands (e.g., PHP files containing `Command` classes) are compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code that gets executed when the commands are invoked through the Symfony Console. This directly leverages the console's mechanism for loading and executing commands.

**Impact:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running the command, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** The files defining the `Command` classes within the application's codebase, which are directly used by the Symfony Console.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong file system permissions to protect command definition files.
* Use version control and code review processes to detect and prevent malicious modifications to command files.
* Regularly scan for malware or unauthorized changes to the codebase.
* Secure the development and deployment pipelines to prevent unauthorized code injection into command files.
