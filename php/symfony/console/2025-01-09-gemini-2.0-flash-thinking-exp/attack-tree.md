## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities:** This category represents a significant risk because console applications often take user-provided input, which, if not properly handled, can be exploited to execute malicious actions.

    *   **Command Injection (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** When console commands accept user input that is directly or indirectly used in shell commands, an attacker can inject malicious commands alongside legitimate input.
        *   **Impact:** This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the application and the underlying system.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   A command like `user:create --email="attacker@example.com; touch /tmp/pwned"` could execute the `touch` command.
            *   Injecting shell commands to read sensitive files, modify configurations, or download and execute malicious scripts.

    *   **Path Traversal:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If console commands handle file paths provided by users without proper validation, an attacker can manipulate these paths to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
        *   **Impact:** This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, the overwriting of critical files, or, in severe cases, remote code execution.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   A command like `file:read --path="../../../etc/passwd"` could expose sensitive system files.
            *   Manipulating paths to overwrite application configuration files with malicious content.
            *   **Include or require arbitrary files leading to code execution:** By traversing to a file containing malicious PHP code and including or requiring it, the attacker can achieve code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Flaws in Console Commands](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_flaws_in_console_commands.md)

*   **Exploit Logic Flaws in Console Commands:** This category highlights risks arising from flaws in the design or implementation of specific console commands.

    *   **Privilege Escalation (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If console commands are executed with elevated privileges (e.g., run by root), and they contain vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage them to perform actions they wouldn't normally be able to.
        *   **Impact:** Successful privilege escalation can grant the attacker full control over the system.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   A vulnerable command to manage system services could be exploited to gain root access.
            *   Exploiting commands that interact with system-level resources without proper authorization checks.
            *   Leveraging misconfigured permissions on console scripts or related files to execute commands with higher privileges.

    *   **Data Manipulation:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can directly modify application data by exploiting console commands that lack proper authorization or validation.
        *   **Impact:** This can lead to unauthorized changes in application data, bypassing business logic and potentially causing significant damage or financial loss.
        *   **Examples:**
            *   A command to update user roles without proper authentication could be abused to grant administrative privileges.
            *   Directly modifying database records through console commands, bypassing application-level validation.
            *   Creating, updating, or deleting sensitive data records without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain access to the server and directly execute console commands](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_the_server_and_directly_execute_console_commands.md)

*   **Gain access to the server and directly execute console commands:** This path highlights the risk of attackers directly interacting with the console after gaining access to the server.

    *   **Attack Vector:** If an attacker gains access to the server (through methods outside the scope of the console itself, such as exploiting web application vulnerabilities, social engineering, or weak credentials), they can directly execute console commands.
    *   **Impact:** This allows the attacker to leverage any available console commands, potentially including those with elevated privileges or those that can directly manipulate sensitive data or the system.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Exploiting weak SSH credentials to log into the server and execute commands.
        *   Compromising developer machines that have access to the server and using their credentials.
