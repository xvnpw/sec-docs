# Attack Surface Analysis for symfony/console

## Attack Surface: [Command Argument and Option Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_argument_and_option_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from unsanitized or unvalidated user-provided input through command arguments and options, leading to injection attacks within the command handler logic.
*   **Console Contribution:** Symfony Console is responsible for parsing and delivering user-provided arguments and options to the command's execution logic. If the command handler doesn't properly handle these inputs, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A command `app:process-file --path=<file_path>` uses `<file_path>` directly in a shell command within the command handler: `exec("process_tool <file_path>")`. An attacker could execute `app:process-file --path="; malicious_command; "` leading to command injection.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all command arguments and options against expected data types, formats, and allowed values *within the command handler*.
    *   **Input Sanitization/Escaping:**  Sanitize or escape user input before using it in any sensitive operations. Specifically, use proper escaping mechanisms when constructing shell commands (e.g., `escapeshellarg` in PHP), database queries (parameterized queries/prepared statements), or any dynamic code execution.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Execute console commands with the minimum necessary user privileges to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Interactive Prompt Injection](./attack_surfaces/interactive_prompt_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to argument/option injection, but vulnerabilities stem from unsanitized input obtained through interactive prompts within console commands, leading to injection attacks.
*   **Console Contribution:** Symfony Console provides the `QuestionHelper` and related classes to create interactive prompts. The input received from these prompts is directly available to the command handler. Lack of sanitization in the handler creates vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A command uses a prompt "Enter file name to delete:" and then uses the response directly in `unlink($fileName)`. An attacker could input `"; system('malicious_command'); //"` to inject and execute a system command alongside the intended file operation.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data deletion, system compromise, potential privilege escalation depending on the command context.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation for Prompts:**  Apply the same rigorous input validation and sanitization to user input obtained from interactive prompts as you would for command arguments and options.
    *   **Sanitization/Escaping for Prompt Input:** Sanitize or escape input from prompts before using it in file system operations, shell commands, database queries, or any other sensitive context.
    *   **Consider Alternatives to Prompts for Sensitive Input:** For critical operations, consider using pre-defined options or configuration instead of relying on free-form user input through prompts, where feasible.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Symfony Console Component and Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_symfony_console_component_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical security vulnerabilities discovered within the Symfony Console component itself or its direct dependencies that could be exploited when using the console.
*   **Console Contribution:** The application's functionality is built upon the Symfony Console component. Any critical vulnerability in this component directly impacts the security of applications using it.
*   **Example:** (Hypothetical) A critical vulnerability is found in the argument parsing logic of Symfony Console that allows for remote code execution when processing specially crafted command-line arguments. Applications using vulnerable versions of Symfony Console would be susceptible.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, potential for complete application and server compromise, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (when critical vulnerabilities exist)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Keep Symfony Console and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions. Security updates often patch critical vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories from Symfony and related security sources to be promptly informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and recommended updates.
    *   **Security Scanning:**  Incorporate automated security scanning tools into your development and deployment pipelines to detect known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including Symfony Console.
