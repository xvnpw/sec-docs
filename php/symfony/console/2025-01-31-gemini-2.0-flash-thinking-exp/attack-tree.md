## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Command Injection Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_command_injection_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker identifies a console command that takes user-controlled input as either:
        *   Command Argument
        *   Command Option
    *   The application fails to properly sanitize or validate this input.
    *   The vulnerable command constructs a shell command using this unsanitized input.
    *   This construction is vulnerable to injection due to:
        *   Using shell execution functions directly with user input (e.g., `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`).
        *   Improperly escaping user input when constructing shell commands.
        *   Vulnerable external command invocation that doesn't handle input securely.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all user input rigorously.
    *   **Secure Command Construction:** Avoid direct shell execution. Use parameterized commands or secure libraries for external command invocation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Input Not Properly Sanitized/Validated:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__input_not_properly_sanitizedvalidated.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   This is a foundational weakness that enables many other vulnerabilities.
    *   It occurs when the application:
        *   Lacks input sanitization entirely, directly using user input in operations.
        *   Implements insufficient input validation, failing to catch malicious or unexpected input.
*   **Impact:** High - Enables Command Injection, Logic Vulnerabilities, and other issues.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   **Implement comprehensive input sanitization:** Remove or escape potentially harmful characters from user input.
    *   **Implement strong input validation:**  Verify that input conforms to expected formats, types, and ranges. Use whitelisting where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Command Construction Vulnerable to Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__command_construction_vulnerable_to_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Even with some input sanitization, the way commands are constructed can still be vulnerable.
    *   Common vulnerable patterns include:
        *   Directly concatenating user input into shell commands.
        *   Using insecure escaping mechanisms that can be bypassed.
        *   Relying on external commands that have their own vulnerabilities when handling input.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Leads directly to Command Injection.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   **Avoid direct shell execution:**  Use language-specific functions or libraries that provide safer ways to interact with the operating system.
    *   **Parameterization:**  Use parameterized commands where possible to separate commands from data.
    *   **Secure Libraries:**  Utilize libraries designed for secure command execution and external process management.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Logic Vulnerability in Command Handler [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_logic_vulnerability_in_command_handler__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker identifies vulnerabilities in the application's code logic within a console command handler.
    *   Specific Logic Vulnerability Types (Critical Nodes within this path):
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Path Traversal]:**
            *   Command accepts file paths as input.
            *   Insufficient path validation allows attackers to use ".." sequences to access files outside the intended directory.
            *   **Impact:** High - File access, information disclosure, potentially file manipulation or even code execution if writable paths are reached.
            *   **Mitigation Focus:** Strict path validation, use absolute paths, restrict access to specific directories, consider chroot.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Deserialization]:**
            *   Command accepts serialized data as input (less common in direct console input, but possible via files or external sources).
            *   Vulnerable deserialization process (e.g., `unserialize` in PHP with untrusted data) allows attackers to inject malicious code during deserialization.
            *   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE).
            *   **Mitigation Focus:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data, use secure deserialization methods, validate data structure before deserialization, prefer safer data formats like JSON.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - File Upload]:**
            *   Command accepts file uploads as input.
            *   Insufficient file validation (e.g., allows malicious file types, no size limits, no content inspection) allows attackers to upload malicious files.
            *   **Impact:** High - Remote Code Execution (if uploaded files can be executed), data manipulation, denial of service.
            *   **Mitigation Focus:** Robust file validation (file type, size, content), store uploaded files securely outside web root, secure file handling practices, use dedicated file upload libraries with security features.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Can range from data breaches and manipulation to Remote Code Execution, depending on the specific logic vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   **Thorough Code Reviews and Security Testing:**  Manually review command handler code for logic flaws. Perform dynamic testing with various inputs and scenarios.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Design commands with minimal necessary privileges.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent common logic vulnerabilities.
