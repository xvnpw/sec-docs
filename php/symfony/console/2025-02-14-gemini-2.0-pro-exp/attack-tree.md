## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Console Commands](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_console_commands.md)

Description:  The attacker injects malicious OS commands into the application through unsanitized input to console commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__command_injection.md)

Description: The attacker injects malicious OS commands into the application through unsanitized input to console commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Unsanitized User Input in Arguments](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__unsanitized_user_input_in_arguments.md)

1.1.1.1. Craft malicious input...:* The attacker provides a specially crafted string as a command argument that, when processed by the application, executes arbitrary OS commands.  Example: `php bin/console mycommand "some_arg; rm -rf /"`
*1.1.1.2. Bypass weak input validation...:* The attacker uses techniques like shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&&`, `` ` ``), or encoding tricks (URL encoding, base64) to circumvent input filters.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Unsanitized User Input in Options](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__unsanitized_user_input_in_options.md)

*1.1.2.1. Craft malicious input...:* Similar to 1.1.1.1, but the malicious input is provided as a command option. Example: `php bin/console mycommand --option="some_value; whoami"`
*1.1.2.2. Bypass weak input validation...:* Same techniques as 1.1.1.2.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Use of `Process` component with unsanitized input](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__use_of__process__component_with_unsanitized_input.md)

*1.1.3.1. Directly pass user-supplied data...:* The developer directly concatenates user input with OS commands when using the `Process` component, creating a vulnerability.
*1.1.3.2. Fail to use `Process::escapeArgument()`...:* The developer uses the `Process` component but forgets to properly escape user-provided arguments, leading to command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__insecure_deserialization.md)

Description: The attacker provides a malicious serialized object as input, which, when deserialized by the application, triggers arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Command accepts serialized data as input...](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__command_accepts_serialized_data_as_input.md)

*1.2.1.1. Craft a malicious serialized object...:* The attacker creates a serialized object containing a "gadget chain" – a sequence of method calls that ultimately lead to code execution. This requires knowledge of the application's codebase and available classes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__path_traversal.md)

Description: The attacker manipulates file paths provided as input to access files outside the intended directory.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Command reads/writes files based on user-supplied paths.](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__command_readswrites_files_based_on_user-supplied_paths.md)

*1.3.1.1. Use "../" sequences...:* The attacker uses `../` sequences in the file path to navigate up the directory structure and access files outside the allowed directory. Example: `php bin/console mycommand --file="../../../etc/passwd"`

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misconfigurations of the Console Application](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misconfigurations_of_the_console_application.md)

Description: Exploit Misconfigurations of the Console Application

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Overly Permissive Command Registration](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__overly_permissive_command_registration.md)

Description:  Sensitive commands are registered and accessible to users who should not have access to them.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Registering commands that should be internal...](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__registering_commands_that_should_be_internal.md)

*2.1.1.1. Execute sensitive commands directly.:* The attacker, having gained access to the console, directly executes commands that perform sensitive operations (e.g., database modifications, user management).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3. Running Console with Excessive Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/2_3__running_console_with_excessive_privileges.md)

Description:  The console application is executed with higher privileges than necessary (e.g., as root).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1. Executing the console application as root...](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1__executing_the_console_application_as_root.md)

*2.3.1.1. If a command is compromised...:* If any command is successfully exploited (e.g., through command injection), the attacker gains the elevated privileges of the user running the console (root in this case).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.4. Exposed Console Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/2_4__exposed_console_endpoint.md)

Description: The console application is accessible from untrusted networks, allowing remote attackers to interact with it.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.4.1. Console accessible from untrusted networks.](./attack_tree_paths/2_4_1__console_accessible_from_untrusted_networks.md)

*2.4.1.1. Directly invoke commands from a remote machine.:* The attacker can directly send commands to the console application over the network, potentially exploiting any vulnerabilities present.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Symfony Console Itself](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_symfony_console_itself.md)

Description: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Symfony Console Itself

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Zero-Day Vulnerability in Symfony Console Code](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__zero-day_vulnerability_in_symfony_console_code.md)

Description:  A previously unknown vulnerability exists in the core Symfony Console component.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Exploit a previously unknown vulnerability...](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__exploit_a_previously_unknown_vulnerability.md)

The attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability that has not yet been publicly disclosed or patched. This requires advanced skills in vulnerability research and exploit development.
