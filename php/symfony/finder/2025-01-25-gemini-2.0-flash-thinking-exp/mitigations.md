# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for symfony/finder

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Starting Directories](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_starting_directories.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify all locations in your codebase where the `Finder->in()` method is used.
2.  For each instance, review the path provided to `in()`.
3.  Ensure that the path is explicitly defined and points to the most restrictive directory possible that still allows Finder to perform its intended function.
4.  Avoid using user-supplied input directly as the base directory for `in()`.
5.  If user input *must* influence the base directory, implement strict validation and sanitization to ensure it remains within the intended boundaries. For example, use a predefined set of allowed base directories and map user input to one of them.
6.  Regularly audit the usage of `Finder->in()` to confirm adherence to these restrictions.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Path Traversal (High Severity): Prevents attackers from escaping the intended directory and accessing sensitive files or directories outside the application's scope.

**Impact:**
*   Path Traversal: High - Significantly reduces the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities by limiting the scope of Finder operations.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Base directories are generally defined in configuration, but user input might indirectly influence them in some search functionalities.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to review all user input handling related to file searching and ensure no user input can directly or indirectly manipulate the base directory passed to `Finder->in()` without strict validation against an allow-list of safe directories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Input for Path Components](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_input_for_path_components.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify all places where user input is used to construct file paths or patterns that are then used with Finder methods like `name()`, `path()`, `contains()`, etc.
2.  Implement input sanitization to remove or encode potentially harmful characters and sequences, especially path traversal sequences like `../` and absolute paths starting with `/`.
3.  Validate user input against an allow-list of permitted characters and path components. For example, if expecting filenames, only allow alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.
4.  Consider using functions specifically designed for path sanitization provided by your framework or language.
5.  Log any attempts to input invalid path components for security monitoring.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Path Traversal (High Severity): Prevents attackers from injecting path traversal sequences through user input to access files outside the intended scope.

**Impact:**
*   Path Traversal: High -  Effectively mitigates path traversal risks arising from user-controlled path components used in Finder operations.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Basic input validation is in place for form fields, but specific path component sanitization for Finder usage might be lacking.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement dedicated path component sanitization specifically for user inputs used in Finder operations. This should be applied consistently across all relevant input points.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Traversal Depth](./mitigation_strategies/limit_traversal_depth.md)

**Description:**
1.  For each Finder instance where directory recursion is involved, explicitly use the `depth()` method.
2.  Set a reasonable maximum depth value based on the expected directory structure and the application's requirements.  Avoid excessively deep recursion.
3.  Document the chosen depth limit and the rationale behind it.
4.  Regularly review the depth limit to ensure it remains appropriate as the application and data structure evolve.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Prevents excessive resource consumption by limiting the depth of directory traversal, mitigating potential DoS attacks that exploit deep directory structures.

**Impact:**
*   DoS: Medium - Reduces the risk of DoS by limiting resource usage during Finder operations, but might not completely eliminate all DoS vectors.

**Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented - `depth()` method is not consistently used in Finder instances.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement `depth()` limits in all Finder usages that involve directory recursion, especially in user-facing features that trigger file searches.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use `ignoreDotFiles()` Method](./mitigation_strategies/use__ignoredotfiles____method.md)

**Description:**
1.  Review all Finder instances in the codebase.
2.  Determine if processing hidden files (dotfiles) is necessary for each instance.
3.  If hidden files are not required, explicitly use the `ignoreDotFiles()` method in the Finder configuration.
4.  Document the decision of whether or not to ignore dotfiles for each Finder usage.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity): Prevents accidental or malicious exposure of sensitive configuration files or other hidden data that might be present as dotfiles.

**Impact:**
*   Information Disclosure: Low to Medium - Reduces the risk of information disclosure by excluding hidden files from Finder's search scope.

**Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented - `ignoreDotFiles()` is not consistently used.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to review all Finder usages and implement `ignoreDotFiles()` where processing hidden files is not intended. This is a relatively simple code change.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Define Search Patterns](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_define_search_patterns.md)

**Description:**
1.  Review all Finder methods that define search patterns, such as `name()`, `path()`, `contains()`, `notName()`, `notPath()`, `notContains()`, etc.
2.  Ensure that these patterns are as specific and restrictive as possible to target only the intended files.
3.  Avoid overly broad patterns (e.g., `*.*`, `*`) that could inadvertently include sensitive files in the search results.
4.  Regularly review and refine search patterns to ensure they remain appropriate and secure as application requirements change.
5.  Document the rationale behind each search pattern and its intended scope.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of unintentionally including sensitive files in search results due to overly broad search patterns used in Finder.

**Impact:**
*   Information Disclosure: Low to Medium - Minimizes the chance of accidental information disclosure by refining search scopes within Finder operations.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Search patterns are generally defined, but might be too broad in some cases and lack specific restrictions.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to review and refine search patterns in all Finder usages to ensure they are as specific and restrictive as possible, minimizing the search scope to only necessary files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Complex Regular Expressions](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_complex_regular_expressions.md)

**Description:**
1.  Minimize the use of regular expressions in Finder methods like `name()` or `contains()`.
