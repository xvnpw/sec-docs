# Threat Model Analysis for symfony/finder

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Path Traversal via User Input](./threats/uncontrolled_path_traversal_via_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-controlled input (e.g., URL parameters, form inputs) to inject "../" sequences or absolute paths into the `in()` method, causing Finder to search outside the intended directories. This allows the attacker to access sensitive files or directories that the application should not expose.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (access to sensitive files, configuration files, source code), potential access to system files, which could lead to further compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder` - specifically the `in()` method and the handling of path arguments.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that is used to construct the paths passed to the `in()` method.
    *   Use absolute paths as the starting point for Finder operations whenever possible, avoiding reliance on relative paths derived from user input.
    *   Implement a whitelist of allowed directories that Finder can access.
    *   Avoid directly using user input in the `in()` method without thorough sanitization.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Overly Permissive File Matching Patterns](./threats/information_disclosure_via_overly_permissive_file_matching_patterns.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage overly broad or poorly constructed regular expressions or glob patterns in methods like `name()`, `contains()`, `path()`, etc., to retrieve more files than intended. This could expose sensitive information that was not meant to be accessible through the application's intended functionality.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data, internal application details, or potentially user data.
*   **Affected Component:** `Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder` - specifically the methods used for filtering files based on patterns (`name()`, `contains()`, `path()`, `matches()`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and test file matching patterns to ensure they are as specific as possible and only match the intended files.
    *   Avoid using overly broad wildcard characters (`*`, `?`) without careful consideration.
    *   If user input is used to construct file matching patterns, implement strict validation and sanitization to prevent malicious patterns.
