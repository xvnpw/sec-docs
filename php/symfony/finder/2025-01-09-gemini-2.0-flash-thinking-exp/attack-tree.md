## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Access unauthorized files and directories on the server.
*   Attack Steps:
    *   Application Accepts User-Controlled Path Input for Finder: The application takes user input (e.g., from a form field, URL parameter) and uses it to specify the directory or path for the Symfony Finder to operate on.
    *   Finder's `in()` or `path()` Method Used with Insufficient Sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]: The application uses the `in()` or `path()` methods of the Symfony Finder component with the user-provided input without properly validating or sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to inject path traversal sequences like `../` to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
*   Impact: Information disclosure, access to sensitive configuration files, potential for further exploitation by reading credentials or other sensitive data.
*   Mitigation:
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided path inputs.
    *   Use absolute paths or predefined allowed directories.
    *   Avoid directly using user input in `in()` or `path()` methods.
    *   Implement proper access controls on the filesystem.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Filename/Pattern Injection Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_filenamepattern_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Access unintended files by manipulating the search patterns used by the Finder.
*   Attack Steps:
    *   Application Accepts User-Controlled Filename/Pattern Input for Finder: The application allows users to provide input that is used as a filename or pattern for the Symfony Finder's `name()` or `contains()` methods.
    *   Finder's `name()` or `contains()` Method Used with Insufficient Sanitization: The application uses the user-provided filename or pattern without properly sanitizing it, allowing attackers to inject special characters used in glob patterns (e.g., `*`, `?`, `[]`) to broaden the search scope and access files they shouldn't.
*   Impact: Access to backup files, temporary files, log files, or other unintended files, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service if patterns are overly broad and cause performance issues.
*   Mitigation:
    *   Sanitize user-provided filename/pattern inputs to remove or escape special characters used in glob patterns.
    *   Use more specific and restrictive patterns programmatically.
    *   Consider using a whitelist of allowed filenames/patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Content-Based Search Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_content-based_search_vulnerability.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Compromise the application by exploiting how it processes the content of files found by the Finder.
*   Attack Steps:
    *   Application Uses Finder's `contains()` Method with User-Controlled Content: The application uses the `contains()` method of the Symfony Finder, where the search term is derived from user input.
    *   Application Processes the Found File Content in a Vulnerable Way [CRITICAL NODE]: The application takes the content of the files found by the Finder and processes it in a way that introduces a security vulnerability, such as:
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): If the file content is used to construct or influence an external network request.
        *   Code Injection: If the file content is interpreted or executed as code.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): If the file content is displayed in a web context without proper encoding.
*   Impact: Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server, Server-Side Request Forgery, Cross-Site Scripting attacks, and other vulnerabilities depending on how the content is processed.
*   Mitigation:
    *   Avoid directly using user-controlled content in `contains()`.
    *   If using `contains()`, carefully sanitize or validate the found file content before further processing.
    *   Implement robust security measures to prevent SSRF, code injection, and XSS vulnerabilities in the application's file processing logic.
