# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Symfony Finder component is a PHP library that efficiently locates files and directories based on various criteria. It simplifies file system traversal and filtering, making it easier for developers to manage and process files within their applications.

Business priorities and goals for using Symfony Finder:

- Efficient file management: Streamline operations that require locating files, such as backups, content management, log processing, and application deployment.
- Improved developer productivity: Provide a convenient and expressive API for file system interactions, reducing development time and complexity.
- Consistent file handling: Ensure uniform file searching and filtering logic across different parts of an application or project.

Most important business risks to address:

- Incorrect file processing: If file selection criteria are flawed, the wrong files might be processed, leading to data corruption, application errors, or security vulnerabilities.
- Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient file searching can slow down applications, especially when dealing with large file systems.
- Denial of Service:  Uncontrolled or malicious use of file system operations could potentially lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
- Information Disclosure: If file paths or file contents are inadvertently exposed due to improper handling, it could lead to information disclosure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Input validation within the Finder component to prevent unexpected behavior from provided paths and patterns. (Implemented within the `Finder` class methods, e.g., path validation, pattern validation).
- security control:  Principle of least privilege in file system access. The Finder component operates with the permissions of the PHP process executing it. (Implicit in the design, relies on the application's environment setup).
- accepted risk:  Reliance on the security of the underlying operating system and file system permissions. (Documented implicitly by assuming standard OS security practices).
- accepted risk:  Vulnerabilities in dependencies. (Addressed by Symfony project's dependency management and security advisories, but inherent risk exists).

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement static analysis security testing (SAST) on the Finder component code to identify potential vulnerabilities during development.
- security control: Integrate dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the Finder component (if any).
- security control:  Provide clear documentation and examples emphasizing secure usage of the Finder component, especially regarding input sanitization and handling of sensitive file paths.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library component like Finder. Authentication is handled at the application level that uses the Finder.
- Authorization:  Finder operates within the authorization context of the application using it. Applications must ensure that the PHP process running Finder has appropriate permissions to access the file system locations being searched.
- Input validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all input paths and patterns provided to the Finder component to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.
    - Requirement: Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks if input is used in shell commands or other potentially unsafe operations (though Finder itself does not execute shell commands).
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of Finder. Cryptography might be relevant if applications using Finder are dealing with encrypted files, but this is outside the scope of the Finder component itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by Symfony Finder (indirectly, as a component):

- File-based content management: Applications using Finder for content management rely on it to accurately locate and manage content files.
- Log processing and analysis: Applications processing logs might use Finder to locate relevant log files for analysis.
- Backup and restore operations: Backup systems might use Finder to identify files to be backed up.
- Application deployment: Deployment scripts might use Finder to locate files for deployment.

Data being protected and its sensitivity:

- File paths: Finder operates on file paths. File paths themselves might reveal information about system structure or application logic, but are generally low sensitivity.
- File content (indirectly): While Finder doesn't directly handle file content, it's used to locate files, and the content of those files might be highly sensitive (e.g., user data, configuration files, application secrets). The sensitivity depends entirely on the application using Finder and the files it's designed to find and process.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What are the specific use cases for Symfony Finder in the target application or project? (This would help to refine the business posture and risk assessment).
- What are the security requirements of the applications that will use Symfony Finder? (This would help to prioritize security controls and requirements).
- What is the deployment environment for applications using Symfony Finder? (This would help to tailor the deployment diagram and security considerations).

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is efficient and reliable file management within PHP applications.
- SECURITY POSTURE:  Security is a concern, and basic security practices are expected in the development and deployment of applications using Symfony Finder.  The focus is on preventing common vulnerabilities like path traversal and ensuring secure usage of the component.
- DESIGN: Symfony Finder is used as a component within larger PHP applications, typically web applications. The deployment environment is assumed to be a standard Linux server with a web server and PHP-FPM. The build process follows typical PHP library development practices using Composer and automated testing.
