## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Symfony Finder (High-Risk Entry Point, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_symfony_finder__high-risk_entry_point__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This represents the initial goal of the attacker. It's the starting point for all potential compromises related to the Finder component.
* **How it Works:** The attacker aims to leverage vulnerabilities within the application's use of the Symfony Finder to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or disrupt the application.
* **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:** Successful compromise can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, system takeover, and reputational damage. It's the gateway to all other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information (Critical Node: Data Breach Potential)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_sensitive_information__critical_node_data_breach_potential_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker's objective is to bypass access controls and retrieve confidential data stored within the application's file system.
* **How it Works:** This is achieved by exploiting weaknesses in how the application uses the Finder to locate and access files, allowing the attacker to access files they shouldn't.
* **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:**  Exposure of sensitive information can have significant legal, financial, and reputational repercussions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability (High-Risk Path Start)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_vulnerability__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate file paths provided to the Finder to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
* **How it Works:** By using special characters like `../` or absolute paths, attackers can navigate the file system beyond the designated base directories.
* **Why it's High-Risk:** Path traversal is a well-understood and frequently exploited vulnerability. It often requires minimal effort and skill to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsanitized User Input in `in()` method (Critical Node: Common Vulnerability)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsanitized_user_input_in__in____method__critical_node_common_vulnerability_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application directly uses user-provided input to define the directories scanned by the `Finder->in()` method without proper validation or sanitization.
* **How it Works:** An attacker can inject malicious path segments into the user input, causing the Finder to search in unintended locations, potentially exposing sensitive files.
* **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:** This is a very common coding mistake and a prime target for attackers. It directly enables path traversal attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Node: Highest Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node_highest_impact_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker's ultimate goal is to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
* **How it Works:** This can be achieved through various means, including exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities or deserialization flaws.
* **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:** RCE grants the attacker complete control over the compromised system, allowing them to steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities via Path Traversal (High-Risk Path Start)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_inclusion_vulnerabilities_via_path_traversal__high-risk_path_start_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers combine path traversal techniques with file inclusion vulnerabilities in the application.
* **How it Works:** By using path traversal to locate malicious files (e.g., containing PHP code) and then exploiting the application's file inclusion mechanisms, the attacker can force the server to execute their code.
* **Why it's High-Risk:** This is a powerful attack vector that directly leads to RCE. Path traversal makes it easier to locate and include attacker-controlled files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Include Malicious Files via Unsanitized Paths (Critical Node: Direct RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/include_malicious_files_via_unsanitized_paths__critical_node_direct_rce_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application uses the results of the Finder (influenced by path traversal) to include files without proper validation, allowing the inclusion of attacker-controlled malicious files.
* **How it Works:** The attacker leverages path traversal to point the Finder to a malicious file they have uploaded or placed on the server. The application then includes and executes this file.
* **Why it's High-Risk/Critical:** This step directly results in remote code execution, representing a complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.
