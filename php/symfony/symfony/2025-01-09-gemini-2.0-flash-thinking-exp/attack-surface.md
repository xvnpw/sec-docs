# Attack Surface Analysis for symfony/symfony

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_twig.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious Twig code into templates, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server.
    *   **How Symfony Contributes:** Symfony's use of the Twig templating engine, especially when directly rendering user-controlled data within templates without proper escaping, creates this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**  A user comment field is rendered directly in a Twig template like `{{ comment }}`. An attacker submits a comment containing `{{ _self.env.getRuntime('Symfony\\Component\\Process\\Process')(['whoami']).getOutput() }}`.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always escape user-provided data using Twig's escaping mechanisms (e.g., `{{ comment|escape }}`).
        *   Avoid rendering raw user input directly; sanitize and validate before rendering.
        *   Restrict access to dangerous Twig functions and filters, potentially using Twig's sandbox environment.
        *   Regularly update Symfony and Twig.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation, attackers can inject malicious objects leading to remote code execution or other attacks.
    *   **How Symfony Contributes:** Symfony's Serializer component can be a vector for deserialization attacks if used to deserialize data from untrusted sources without careful validation and type checking.
    *   **Example:** An application receives serialized data from a cookie and uses Symfony's Serializer to unserialize it without verifying the data's integrity or origin. A malicious payload could be crafted and injected.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        *   Use signed or encrypted serialization to ensure data integrity and authenticity (Symfony's Security component can help).
        *   Implement strict type checking and validation before deserializing.
        *   Keep dependencies updated.

## Attack Surface: [Form Handling Vulnerabilities (Lack of CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/form_handling_vulnerabilities__lack_of_csrf_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly configured forms lacking CSRF protection can allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
    *   **How Symfony Contributes:** Symfony's Form component simplifies form creation, but not enabling CSRF protection leaves forms open to cross-site request forgery attacks.
    *   **Example:** A form for transferring funds lacks a CSRF token. An attacker can craft a malicious link or website that, when clicked by a logged-in user, initiates an unauthorized transfer.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable CSRF protection for all state-changing forms using Symfony's built-in features.

## Attack Surface: [Security Misconfigurations (Firewalls, Access Control)](./attack_surfaces/security_misconfigurations__firewalls__access_control_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured security firewalls or access control rules can lead to unauthorized access to protected resources.
    *   **How Symfony Contributes:** Symfony's Security component provides tools for authentication and authorization, but misconfigurations in `security.yaml` can create vulnerabilities, such as overly broad access rules.
    *   **Example:** A firewall rule allows anonymous access to an administrative section defined in `security.yaml`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring firewalls and access control rules in `security.yaml`.
        *   Review `security.yaml` configuration meticulously and test access rules.
        *   Use specific role hierarchies to manage permissions effectively.
        *   Implement robust security voters and ensure they are well-tested.
        *   Regularly audit security configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Console Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/console_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If console commands accept user input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject shell commands.
    *   **How Symfony Contributes:** Symfony's Console component allows creating command-line tools that, if not secured, can be exploited through command injection.
    *   **Example:** A console command takes a filename as input and uses it in `exec('process_file ' . $inputFileName)`. An attacker could provide input like `file.txt; rm -rf /`.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data deletion, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `exec`, `shell_exec`, `system`, etc., with user-provided input. Sanitize input rigorously if necessary.
        *   Use Symfony's Process component for safer execution of external commands.
        *   Validate and sanitize all input to console commands.
        *   Restrict access to sensitive console commands.
