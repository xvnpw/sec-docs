# Threat Model Analysis for symfony/symfony

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Request Data Binding](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_request_data_binding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate request data (e.g., through form submissions or API calls) to modify object properties that were not intended to be directly settable. This can lead to unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation (by setting admin flags, for example), or bypassing business logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, bypassing security checks.
    *   **Affected Symfony Component:** Symfony Form Component, Symfony Serializer Component (when deserializing request data directly into objects)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Symfony's Form component with explicit field mappings and validation rules.
        *   Employ the "validation groups" feature to control which fields are validated in different contexts.
        *   When using the Serializer, explicitly define which properties can be set during deserialization using annotations or configuration.
        *   Consider using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) as an intermediary layer between request data and your entities, mapping only the allowed data.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Debug Routing and Profiler](./threats/information_disclosure_through_debug_routing_and_profiler.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gaining access to a production environment with debug mode enabled (or through misconfigured firewalls) could leverage Symfony's debug toolbar and profiler to gather sensitive information. This includes configuration details, environment variables, and internal application state, which can be used to further exploit the application.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data (API keys, database credentials), insights into application logic and vulnerabilities, facilitating further attacks.
    *   **Affected Symfony Component:** Symfony Web Profiler Component, Symfony Debug Component
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if in production)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure debug mode is **strictly disabled** in production environments.
        *   Implement strong firewall rules to restrict access to the Symfony profiler in non-production environments.
        *   Be mindful of the information exposed by custom debug panels and ensure they don't reveal sensitive data.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Twig Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unescaped_twig_output.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious client-side scripts into the application by providing input that is not properly escaped when rendered in Twig templates. This script could then be executed in other users' browsers, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement of the application, phishing attacks targeting users.
    *   **Affected Symfony Component:** Twig Templating Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rely on Twig's auto-escaping feature, which is enabled by default.
        *   Carefully review any instances where auto-escaping is explicitly disabled or the `raw` filter is used. Ensure that the data being rendered is absolutely safe or has been properly sanitized.
        *   Sanitize user input before rendering it in templates if absolutely necessary, using appropriate escaping functions for the context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS).

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_twig.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Twig code directly into template input if user-provided data is not treated as plain text. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. While less common with default configurations, it can occur in specific scenarios where user input is dynamically included in template rendering logic.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Symfony Component:** Twig Templating Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** directly embed user input into Twig template code. Treat user input as data to be displayed, not as code to be executed.
        *   Avoid dynamic template generation based on user input.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization if dynamic template logic is absolutely necessary (though highly discouraged).

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Security Features](./threats/misconfiguration_of_security_features.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or incomplete configuration of Symfony's security component. This could involve bypassing authentication mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access due to weak access control rules, or exploiting insecure password hashing configurations (though Symfony's defaults are generally secure).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, data breaches, privilege escalation, account compromise.
    *   **Affected Symfony Component:** Symfony Security Component (firewalls, access control rules, user providers, encoders)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific misconfiguration)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand and correctly configure Symfony's security component based on the application's requirements.
        *   Regularly review `security.yaml` and related configuration files for potential misconfigurations.
        *   Utilize Symfony's built-in security features like voters and access control lists (ACLs) appropriately to enforce granular permissions.
        *   Ensure strong password hashing algorithms are used (Symfony's defaults are generally good, but be cautious with custom implementations).

## Threat: [Insecure User Providers](./threats/insecure_user_providers.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within custom user providers if they are not implemented securely. For example, directly querying the database with unsanitized input within a user provider could lead to SQL injection during the authentication process.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access to user accounts, potential for further database exploitation.
    *   **Affected Symfony Component:** Symfony Security Component (User Providers)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement user providers securely, using parameterized queries or the Doctrine ORM to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Follow best practices for password storage and retrieval, avoiding storing passwords in plain text.
        *   Thoroughly test custom user providers for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [CSRF Token Bypass or Weaknesses](./threats/csrf_token_bypass_or_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could bypass or exploit weaknesses in Symfony's Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection if it's not properly implemented or configured. This allows them to trick authenticated users into unknowingly performing actions on the application, such as changing their password or making unauthorized purchases.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users, data modification, financial loss.
    *   **Affected Symfony Component:** Symfony Security Component (CSRF Protection), Symfony Form Component
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure CSRF protection is enabled for all state-changing requests.
        *   Use Symfony's form component, which automatically handles CSRF token generation and validation.
        *   Properly handle CSRF tokens in custom forms and AJAX requests, ensuring tokens are included in requests and validated on the server-side.
        *   Avoid disabling CSRF protection unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the risks.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data_in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Storing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or encryption secrets directly in configuration files (e.g., `parameters.yaml`, `.env`) can lead to exposure if these files are compromised, accidentally committed to version control, or accessible through misconfigured web servers.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to access external services, databases, or decrypt sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Symfony Component:** Symfony Configuration Component
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize environment variables to store sensitive configuration data.
        *   Avoid committing sensitive information directly to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files.
        *   Implement secure configuration management practices, such as using dedicated secrets management tools.
        *   Ensure proper file permissions are set on configuration files in production environments.
