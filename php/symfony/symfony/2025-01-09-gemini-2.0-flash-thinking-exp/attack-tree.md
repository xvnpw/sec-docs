## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing/Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routingrequest_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Manipulate Route Parameters:** Attackers target the data passed within the URL's path or query parameters. Symfony uses the `ParameterBag` to handle these.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Deserialization (Symfony's ParameterBag):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application deserializes data from route parameters without proper validation, an attacker can craft malicious serialized objects. When these objects are deserialized, they can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This leverages vulnerabilities in PHP's `unserialize()` function when handling untrusted data.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Full control over the server, data breaches, service disruption.
    *   **Bypass Access Controls based on Route Parameters:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Developers might incorrectly rely on route parameters to enforce access controls. An attacker can modify these parameters in the URL to access resources or functionalities they are not authorized to use. For example, changing an `id` parameter to access another user's profile or modify their data.
        *   **Impact:** Significant. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform actions on behalf of other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_component_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in Symfony's built-in security features or their configuration.
    *   **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to circumvent the login process. This could involve exploiting flaws in custom authentication providers (e.g., logic errors, SQL injection if the provider interacts with a database), or vulnerabilities in the "remember-me" functionality (e.g., predictable tokens, insecure storage).
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Complete takeover of user accounts, ability to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Bypass Authorization Checks:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Once authenticated (or if authentication is bypassed), attackers try to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for. This can involve exploiting flaws in Access Control Lists (ACLs) or custom voters (e.g., logic errors, incorrect attribute handling), or by exploiting misconfigurations in the `security.yaml` file (e.g., incorrect role hierarchies, missing access rules).
        *   **Impact:** Significant. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform privileged actions.
    *   **Exploit Security Misconfigurations:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Incorrect or insecure settings in Symfony's `security.yaml` file can create vulnerabilities. This includes improperly configured firewalls (allowing access to sensitive areas), missing or incorrect access rules (failing to restrict access to certain resources), or insecure settings for session management.
        *   **Impact:** Significant. Can lead to various vulnerabilities like unauthorized access, information disclosure, or session hijacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Templating Engine (Twig) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_templating_engine__twig__vulnerabilities.md)

**Achieve Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If user-controlled input is directly embedded into Twig templates without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject malicious Twig code. When the template is rendered, this injected code is executed on the server. This allows for arbitrary code execution, as Twig has access to the underlying PHP environment. Common scenarios include rendering data from a database directly into a template without escaping.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Full control over the server, data breaches, service disruption.
