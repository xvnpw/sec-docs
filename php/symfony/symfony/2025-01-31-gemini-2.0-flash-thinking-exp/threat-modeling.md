# Threat Model Analysis for symfony/symfony

## Threat: [Symfony Core Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/symfony_core_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability within the Symfony framework's core code. This is achieved by sending malicious requests designed to trigger bugs in Symfony components like the Router, HTTP Kernel, Security, or Form components. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to take complete control of the server, or Denial of Service (DoS), rendering the application unavailable. Information disclosure, exposing sensitive data, is also a potential outcome.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of the application and server, potential data breach, service outage, and severe reputational damage.
*   **Symfony Component Affected:**  Core Symfony Framework (Router, HTTP Kernel, Security Component, Form Component, Serializer, Validator, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize Symfony Updates:**  Immediately update Symfony to the latest stable version upon release, especially when security patches are announced. Utilize `composer update symfony/*` to update core Symfony components.
    *   **Subscribe to Symfony Security Advisories:** Actively monitor the official Symfony security advisories and security mailing lists to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implement Automated Security Checks:** Integrate automated security scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline to detect outdated Symfony versions and known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** The Symfony application is mistakenly deployed with debug mode enabled (`APP_DEBUG=1` in `.env` or environment variables). Attackers can leverage debug mode to access sensitive information exposed through error pages, the Symfony Profiler, and the web debug toolbar. This includes application configuration details, internal paths, database queries, and potentially sensitive environment variables, which can be used to facilitate further attacks or direct information theft.
*   **Impact:** High. Significant Information Disclosure, potentially leading to account takeover, data breaches, or further exploitation of application weaknesses.
*   **Symfony Component Affected:**  Debug Component, ErrorHandler, Web Profiler Bundle.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Force Disable Debug Mode in Production:**  Ensure `APP_DEBUG=0` is explicitly set in the production `.env` file or environment variables.  Verify this setting during deployment processes.
    *   **Remove Web Profiler in Production:**  Consider completely removing or disabling the `web-profiler-bundle` in production environments to eliminate the risk of accidental exposure.
    *   **Implement Production-Specific Error Handling:** Configure custom error pages and robust logging mechanisms that do not expose sensitive application details in production error responses.

## Threat: [Insecure `APP_SECRET` Management](./threats/insecure__app_secret__management.md)

*   **Description:** The `APP_SECRET` parameter in Symfony, crucial for security features like session management, CSRF protection, and encryption, is weak, predictable, or exposed.  If compromised, attackers can perform session hijacking, bypass CSRF protection, tamper with encrypted data, or potentially gain unauthorized access by forging security tokens. Exposure of `APP_SECRET` in version control or logs drastically increases this risk.
*   **Impact:** High. Session hijacking, CSRF bypass, data tampering, potential authentication bypass, and compromise of security mechanisms.
*   **Symfony Component Affected:**  Security Component, Session Component, CSRF Protection, Encryption services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Generate Strong `APP_SECRET`:** Use a cryptographically strong, randomly generated string for `APP_SECRET`.  Symfony's `secrets:generate-keys` command can assist with this.
    *   **Securely Store `APP_SECRET`:** Store `APP_SECRET` securely using environment variables, a dedicated secrets management system (like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret managers), or secure configuration management practices.  Never hardcode it in code or configuration files committed to version control.
    *   **Restrict Access to `.env` Files:**  Limit access to `.env` files in production environments to prevent unauthorized disclosure of `APP_SECRET`.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_twig.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into Twig templates through user-controlled input that is not properly escaped. If developers incorrectly use the `raw` filter or disable auto-escaping in Twig when rendering user-provided data, attackers can inject and execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting malicious Twig template expressions within user input fields.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to complete server compromise and potential data breaches.
*   **Symfony Component Affected:**  Twig Templating Engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Auto-Escaping in Twig:** Rely on Twig's default auto-escaping functionality and ensure it is enabled. Avoid disabling auto-escaping unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    *   **Strictly Avoid `raw` Filter on User Input:**  Minimize or completely eliminate the use of the `raw` filter when rendering user-provided data in Twig templates. If absolutely required, perform rigorous sanitization and validation of the input *before* using `raw`.
    *   **Regular Template Security Reviews:** Conduct periodic security reviews of Twig templates, especially those handling user input, to identify and remediate potential SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Symfony Forms](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_symfony_forms.md)

*   **Description:** Symfony forms are not properly configured to restrict allowed fields and lack sufficient validation. Attackers can manipulate HTTP requests to include or modify form fields that are not intended to be user-editable. This can lead to unintended modification of application data, bypassing business logic, privilege escalation if sensitive fields are exposed, or data corruption.
*   **Impact:** High. Data manipulation, potential privilege escalation, bypass of security controls, and data integrity issues.
*   **Symfony Component Affected:**  Form Component, Validator Component.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Define Explicit Form Validation Rules:** Implement comprehensive and strict validation rules for all form fields using Symfony's Validator component.
    *   **Use `allow_extra_fields: false` in Form Types:**  Set the `allow_extra_fields` option to `false` in Symfony form types to explicitly prevent the processing of unexpected or unallowed form fields.
    *   **Explicitly Define Allowed Fields:**  Carefully define the allowed fields within form types and only process data from these explicitly defined fields.
    *   **Server-Side Validation is Mandatory:** Always perform robust server-side validation of all form data. Never rely solely on client-side validation for security.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Security Component Misconfiguration](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_security_component_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:**  The Symfony Security Component is incorrectly configured, resulting in flaws in authentication and authorization mechanisms. This can stem from misconfigured firewalls, vulnerabilities in custom authentication providers or listeners, or improperly defined access control rules (ACLs or Voters). Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access to protected resources, and perform actions they should not be permitted to.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Unauthorized access to sensitive data and application functionality, potentially leading to complete application compromise and data breaches.
*   **Symfony Component Affected:**  Security Component (Firewall, Authentication Providers, Listeners, Voters, ACL).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly Review Security Configuration:**  Carefully review and test the Symfony Security Component configuration, including firewalls, authentication providers, and access control rules, to ensure they accurately reflect the intended security policy.
    *   **Implement Unit and Integration Tests for Security:**  Write unit and integration tests specifically to verify the correct functioning of authentication and authorization logic and to detect potential bypasses.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Security Configuration:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Security Component configuration and custom security code to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Follow Security Component Best Practices:** Adhere to Symfony Security Component best practices and guidelines when implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
