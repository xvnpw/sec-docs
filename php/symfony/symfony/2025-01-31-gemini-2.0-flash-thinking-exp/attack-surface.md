# Attack Surface Analysis for symfony/symfony

## Attack Surface: [1. Unprotected Development Routes (Debug Mode)](./attack_surfaces/1__unprotected_development_routes__debug_mode_.md)

*   **Description:** Development routes like `/_profiler` and `/_wdt` are exposed in production, leaking sensitive information and potentially allowing code execution.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony's debug mode, enabled by default in development, automatically registers these routes.
*   **Example:** Debug mode is accidentally left enabled in a production environment. An attacker accesses `/_profiler` and gains access to application configuration, database credentials, and potentially uses profiler features to execute code.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential remote code execution, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly disable debug mode in production.** Set `APP_DEBUG=0` or `APP_ENV=prod` in production environment variables.
    *   Implement network-level restrictions to development routes even in non-production environments.

## Attack Surface: [2. Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig](./attack_surfaces/2__server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_twig.md)

*   **Description:** User-controlled input is directly embedded into Twig templates without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject malicious Twig code.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Twig templating engine, while powerful, can be vulnerable if user input is not handled securely within templates.
*   **Example:** An application displays a user's name in a template using `{{ user.name }}`. If `user.name` is directly derived from user input without sanitization, an attacker could set their name to `{{ app.request.server.setEnv('__evil', 'system("whoami")') }}` and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never directly embed user input into Twig templates without proper escaping.**
    *   **Always use Twig's escaping filters (e.g., `escape('html')`, `escape('js')`).**
    *   Utilize template inheritance and component-based approaches to minimize direct user input in templates.
    *   Implement input sanitization before passing data to templates.

## Attack Surface: [3. Authentication Bypass due to Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/3__authentication_bypass_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Symfony's Security component lead to authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony's flexible Security component requires careful configuration of firewalls, access control, and authentication providers.
*   **Example:** A firewall rule is misconfigured, allowing anonymous access to a protected area of the application. An attacker bypasses authentication and accesses sensitive resources.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, privilege escalation, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully configure firewalls, access control rules, and authentication providers in `security.yaml`.**
    *   Thoroughly test authentication mechanisms to ensure they function as intended and prevent bypasses.
    *   Regularly review security configurations and access control rules.
    *   Implement principle of least privilege in access control configurations.

## Attack Surface: [4. Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using Serialization)](./attack_surfaces/4__deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_using_serialization_.md)

*   **Description:** Deserializing data from untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony's Serializer component can be used to deserialize data, which can be dangerous if used on untrusted input.
*   **Example:** An application deserializes user-provided data using the Serializer component without proper validation. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources whenever possible.**
    *   If deserialization is necessary, carefully validate and sanitize the input data *before* deserialization.
    *   Consider using safer serialization formats (like JSON) or alternative data exchange methods.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the serialized data itself.

## Attack Surface: [5. Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/5__exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive Symfony configuration files are exposed due to misconfiguration, revealing credentials and secrets.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony relies on configuration files like `.env` and YAML files, which contain sensitive information.
*   **Example:** Web server is misconfigured, allowing direct access to `.env` file via a browser request. An attacker accesses `.env` and obtains database credentials, API keys, and application secrets.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, server compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Ensure proper web server configuration to prevent direct access to configuration files.**
    *   **Restrict file permissions to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive configuration files.**
    *   Store sensitive configuration outside of the web root if possible.
    *   Use environment variables instead of storing secrets directly in configuration files where feasible.

## Attack Surface: [6. Route Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/6__route_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate route definitions, potentially accessing unintended functionalities or bypassing security checks.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony's routing system allows for dynamic route generation, which, if not handled carefully, can be vulnerable to injection.
*   **Example:** An application dynamically generates routes based on database records. If input used to query the database is not sanitized, an attacker could inject SQL to manipulate the query and generate routes to admin panels or sensitive functions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features, privilege escalation, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all input used in dynamic route generation.
    *   Avoid directly using user input in route definitions.
    *   Implement strict access control on sensitive routes.
    *   Regularly review and audit route configurations.

## Attack Surface: [7. Input Validation Bypass in Controllers](./attack_surfaces/7__input_validation_bypass_in_controllers.md)

*   **Description:** Controllers directly process raw request data without proper validation, leading to common input validation vulnerabilities.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony allows direct access to `Request` objects in controllers, which can be misused if validation is skipped.
*   **Example:** A controller directly uses `$_POST['email']` without validation to update a user's email in the database. An attacker sends a malicious payload in the `email` field, leading to XSS or SQL injection if the controller interacts with the database directly without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** XSS, SQL Injection, Command Injection, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use Symfony's Form component or Validator component for input validation.**
    *   Avoid directly accessing and processing raw request data in controllers.
    *   Sanitize and escape output data appropriately to prevent XSS.
    *   Use parameterized queries or ORM for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [8. Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Entity Binding)](./attack_surfaces/8__mass_assignment_vulnerabilities__entity_binding_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify unintended entity properties by manipulating request data bound directly to Doctrine entities.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Doctrine ORM and Symfony's data binding features can be misused if not configured securely.
*   **Example:** A controller directly updates a User entity based on request data without using Symfony Forms and proper field whitelisting. An attacker sends a request with an unexpected field like `is_admin=true`, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Symfony Forms for controlled data binding to entities.**
    *   Define allowed fields explicitly in forms and prevent binding of unexpected data.
    *   Avoid using `allow_extra_fields` in forms unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    *   Implement proper authorization checks before updating entities.

## Attack Surface: [9. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Twig Output](./attack_surfaces/9__cross-site_scripting__xss__through_twig_output.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or missing escaping of variables in Twig templates leads to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Twig's flexibility requires developers to be mindful of escaping contexts.
*   **Example:** A template displays user-generated content using `{{ content }}` without escaping. If `content` contains malicious JavaScript, it will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Client-side code execution, session hijacking, defacement, phishing attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Ensure all dynamic variables in Twig templates are properly escaped using appropriate filters based on the output context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS).**
    *   **Leverage Twig's auto-escaping feature.**
    *   Regularly review template code for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [10. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/10__cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** CSRF protection is not properly implemented for forms, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony provides built-in CSRF protection, but it needs to be explicitly enabled and used correctly.
*   **Example:** A form to change a user's password lacks CSRF protection. An attacker crafts a malicious website that includes a form submitting a password change request to the vulnerable application. If a logged-in user visits the malicious website, their password might be changed without their knowledge.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions on behalf of users, data modification, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always enable and correctly implement CSRF protection for all forms that perform state-changing operations.**
    *   Use Symfony's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms (CSRF tokens in forms).
    *   Verify CSRF tokens on the server-side for all state-changing requests.

## Attack Surface: [11. Authorization Bypass due to Logic Errors in Access Control](./attack_surfaces/11__authorization_bypass_due_to_logic_errors_in_access_control.md)

*   **Description:** Logic errors in authorization rules or voters lead to authorization bypass vulnerabilities.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony's voter system provides fine-grained authorization control, but logic errors can occur in voter implementations.
*   **Example:** A voter incorrectly implements a check for admin privileges, allowing regular users to access admin functionalities. An attacker exploits this logic error to gain unauthorized access to admin features.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Design authorization logic carefully and test access control rules rigorously.**
    *   Use Symfony's voter system for complex authorization logic and ensure voters are correctly implemented and cover all relevant access control scenarios.
    *   Write unit tests for voters to verify authorization logic.
    *   Conduct code reviews of authorization logic.

## Attack Surface: [12. Session Fixation and Session Hijacking](./attack_surfaces/12__session_fixation_and_session_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** Improper session management leads to session fixation or session hijacking vulnerabilities.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony's session management relies on PHP's session handling, which needs to be configured securely.
*   **Example:** Session cookies are not configured with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. An attacker can intercept session cookies via XSS or man-in-the-middle attacks and hijack user sessions. Or, the application doesn't regenerate session IDs on login, making it vulnerable to session fixation.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configure secure session management in `framework.yaml`, including using secure cookie settings (`cookie_secure: true`, `cookie_httponly: true`, `cookie_samesite: lax` or `cookie_samesite: strict`).**
    *   **Regenerate session IDs on login (`$request->getSession()->migrate(true)`).**
    *   Implement proper session timeout mechanisms.
    *   Use HTTPS to protect session cookies in transit.

## Attack Surface: [13. Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Bundles](./attack_surfaces/13__vulnerabilities_in_third-party_bundles.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party bundles contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the application.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Symfony's bundle ecosystem encourages the use of third-party libraries, which can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A popular third-party bundle used in the application has a known security vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can be Critical or High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update all third-party bundles to the latest versions.**
    *   **Monitor security advisories for Symfony bundles and promptly address reported vulnerabilities.**
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Carefully vet and select reputable and well-maintained bundles.

## Attack Surface: [14. Supply Chain Attacks through Bundles](./attack_surfaces/14__supply_chain_attacks_through_bundles.md)

*   **Description:** Compromised or malicious third-party bundles introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors.
*   **Symfony Contribution:** Reliance on external bundles increases the risk of supply chain attacks.
*   **Example:** A popular bundle is compromised, and a malicious version is released. Developers unknowingly update to the compromised version, introducing a backdoor into their application.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, supply chain disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the malicious code).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully vet and select reputable and well-maintained bundles.**
    *   Use dependency management tools like Composer to manage bundles and verify package integrity (e.g., using `composer audit`).
    *   Consider using security scanning tools to detect suspicious code or known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Implement code review processes for dependencies, especially for critical bundles.
