## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploiting Symfony Framework Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploiting_symfony_framework_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Known Symfony Core Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Description:** Attackers target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of the Symfony framework core.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   Identify a Symfony application running an outdated and vulnerable version.
        *   Research publicly available exploits for known vulnerabilities (e.g., from Symfony Security Advisories, CVE databases).
        *   [CRITICAL NODE] Execute Exploit against Application [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Deploy the exploit to compromise the application, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, or full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploiting Symfony Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploiting_symfony_misconfiguration__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** [HIGH-RISK PATH] Debug Mode Enabled in Production [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit the misconfiguration of having debug mode enabled in a production environment.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   Identify that the application is running in production with debug mode enabled (e.g., `APP_DEBUG=1`).
        *   Access debug pages or the Symfony profiler, which are exposed in debug mode.
        *   [CRITICAL NODE] Extract Sensitive Information [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:  Retrieve sensitive data from debug pages and profiler, such as configuration details, environment variables (potentially containing database credentials, API keys), internal file paths, and more. This information can be used for further attacks.

*   **Attack Vector:** [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exposed Configuration Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly accessible configuration files due to web server misconfiguration.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   Identify publicly accessible configuration files like `.env`, `config/packages/*.yaml`, `config/services.yaml` (often due to misconfigured web servers like Apache or Nginx).
        *   Access and download these configuration files directly via web requests.
        *   [CRITICAL NODE] Extract Sensitive Information [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Retrieve sensitive data from configuration files, such as database credentials, API keys, internal settings, and other secrets. This information can be used for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploiting Third-Party Bundles/Libraries Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploiting_third-party_bundleslibraries_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_p_4ff90144.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerable Bundle Directly [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in third-party Symfony bundles used by the application.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   Identify the Symfony bundles used by the application (e.g., by examining `composer.json` or `composer.lock`).
        *   Research known vulnerabilities in these bundles (e.g., from security advisories, CVE databases, bundle repositories).
        *   [CRITICAL NODE] Execute Exploit against Application via Vulnerable Bundle [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Deploy exploits targeting the identified bundle vulnerabilities to compromise the application, potentially leading to RCE, data breaches, or full system compromise.

*   **Attack Vector:** [CRITICAL NODE] Execute Exploit against Application via Vulnerable Bundle Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in dependencies of the Symfony bundles used by the application.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   Identify the Symfony bundles used by the application and their dependencies (e.g., using `composer show -tree` or dependency analysis tools).
        *   Research known vulnerabilities in these bundle dependencies (e.g., from security advisories, CVE databases, dependency vulnerability scanners).
        *   [CRITICAL NODE] Execute Exploit against Application via Vulnerable Bundle Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]: Deploy exploits targeting the identified dependency vulnerabilities, which are indirectly exploited through the Symfony bundle, potentially leading to RCE, data breaches, or full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploiting Application-Specific Code in Symfony Context (Developer Mistakes) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploiting_application-specific_code_in_symfony_context__developer_mistakes___critic_afd4d1a7.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** [HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Form Handling (Developer Code) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from insecure form handling logic implemented by developers in their Symfony application code.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   Identify forms within the application that lack sufficient server-side validation or sanitization of user inputs.

        *   **Sub-Vector:** [HIGH-RISK PATH] SQL Injection via Form Input [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            *   **Description:**  Exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities if developers directly use form input in raw SQL queries (bypassing Doctrine ORM or proper parameterization).
            *   **Breakdown:**
                *   Identify form inputs that are used in raw SQL queries within the application code.
                *   Inject malicious SQL code through these form inputs.
                *   [CRITICAL NODE] Execute Arbitrary SQL Queries and Access/Modify Database [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or full database compromise.

        *   **Sub-Vector:** [HIGH-RISK PATH] Command Injection via Form Input [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            *   **Description:** Exploiting Command Injection vulnerabilities if developers execute system commands based on form input without proper sanitization.
            *   **Breakdown:**
                *   Identify form inputs that are used in system command execution within the application code.
                *   Inject malicious commands through these form inputs.
                *   [CRITICAL NODE] Execute Arbitrary System Commands on Server [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Execute arbitrary system commands on the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and full system compromise.

        *   **Sub-Vector:** [HIGH-RISK PATH] File Upload Vulnerabilities via Forms [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            *   **Description:** Exploiting File Upload vulnerabilities if file uploads via forms are handled insecurely.
            *   **Breakdown:**
                *   Identify file upload functionality within forms.
                *   Bypass client-side or weak server-side file type and size restrictions.
                *   Upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, shell scripts).
                *   [CRITICAL NODE] Execute Malicious Files or Gain Remote Code Execution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Execute the uploaded malicious files on the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) and full system compromise.
