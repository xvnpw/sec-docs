# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project design document outlines the architecture of the Symfony framework, a PHP framework for building web applications and microservices. Understanding the design of Symfony is crucial for organizations considering adopting it, contributing to it, or building applications on top of it.

Business priorities and goals for adopting or using Symfony include:

- Rapid Application Development: Symfony is designed to accelerate the development process through reusable components and a robust set of features.
- Maintainability and Scalability: The framework promotes good coding practices and architectural patterns that lead to maintainable and scalable applications.
- Community Support and Ecosystem: Symfony has a large and active community, providing extensive documentation, support, and a rich ecosystem of bundles (plugins).
- Flexibility and Customization: Symfony is highly flexible and customizable, allowing developers to tailor it to specific project needs.
- Long-Term Support: Symfony provides long-term support (LTS) versions, ensuring stability and security updates for extended periods.

Key business risks associated with using Symfony include:

- Security Vulnerabilities: As with any software framework, Symfony and its dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
- Dependency Management: Managing dependencies, especially in a large ecosystem, can introduce risks if not handled properly.
- Complexity: While flexible, Symfony can be complex to learn and configure, potentially leading to misconfigurations or security oversights if not properly understood.
- Open Source Reliance:  Organizations rely on the open-source community for the ongoing maintenance and security of Symfony.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Symfony project and applications built with it:

- security control: Symfony Security Component: Provides features for authentication, authorization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities. Implemented within the Symfony framework itself.
- security control: Regular Security Releases: The Symfony project actively monitors for security vulnerabilities and releases security updates promptly. Described in Symfony's security policy and release process.
- security control: Input Validation Features: Symfony provides tools and best practices for input validation to prevent injection attacks. Documented in Symfony's documentation and security guides.
- security control: Cryptography Libraries: Symfony integrates with robust cryptography libraries for secure data handling. Implemented within the Symfony framework.
- security control: Community Security Audits: The large Symfony community acts as a form of continuous security review and vulnerability reporting. Implicitly through community contributions and issue reporting.
- accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure: Security vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed, which could be exploited before patches are applied. Accepted as inherent to open-source development.
- accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Symfony or applications built with it. Accepted risk that needs to be managed through dependency scanning and updates.

Recommended security controls to enhance the security posture:

- recommended security control: Automated Dependency Scanning: Implement automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in Symfony's dependencies and application dependencies.
- recommended security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
- recommended security control: Security Code Reviews: Conduct regular security-focused code reviews, especially for critical components and security-sensitive areas.
- recommended security control: Penetration Testing: Perform periodic penetration testing on applications built with Symfony to identify and address security weaknesses.
- recommended security control: Security Training for Developers: Provide security training to developers using Symfony to promote secure coding practices.

Security requirements for projects using Symfony:

- Authentication:

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer makes code changes and commits them to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. A CI server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code changes pushed to the repository.
3. The CI server initiates the build process, which typically includes:
    - Compiling code (if necessary for certain Symfony application setups, though PHP is generally interpreted).
    - Running unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Packaging the application into deployable artifacts (e.g., a compressed archive or Docker image).
4. Security checks are performed during the build process:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools scan the code for potential vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency scanning tools check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies (using Composer's `require-dev` and production dependencies).
5. If security checks pass and tests are successful, build artifacts are created.
6. Build artifacts are then deployed to the target deployment environment (e.g., cloud VM, containers).

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Automated Build Process (CI/CD): Automates the build and deployment process, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistency. Implemented using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrated into the CI pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities. Implemented as part of the 'Security Checks' step.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Automated scanning of project dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Implemented as part of the 'Security Checks' step, using tools like `composer audit`.
- security control: Code Linting and Style Checks: Enforces coding standards and identifies potential code quality issues. Implemented as part of the 'Build Process' step.
- security control: Unit and Integration Tests: Ensures code functionality and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs, including security-related bugs. Implemented as part of the 'Build Process' step.
- security control: Secure Build Environment:  Ensuring the CI/CD environment itself is secure, with access controls and regular updates. Implemented by securing the CI/CD infrastructure.
- security control: Artifact Signing (optional): Signing build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity. Can be implemented as part of the 'Build Artifacts' step.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected: Development and operation of web applications built with Symfony. Ensuring the framework itself is secure and reliable for developers to use.

Data being protected and sensitivity:

- Symfony Framework Source Code: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
- Applications Built with Symfony: Sensitivity depends on the application. User data, business logic, and configuration data within applications can be highly sensitive and require strong protection.
- Symfony Documentation: Medium sensitivity. Integrity is important to ensure accurate and safe guidance for developers.
- Packagist Packages: Medium sensitivity. Integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks through malicious packages.
