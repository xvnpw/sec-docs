## Attack Tree Path: [1. High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerable Form Component (CVE-XXXX-YYYY)](./attack_tree_paths/1__high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerable_form_component__cve-xxxx-yyyy_.md)

*   **Critical Node:**  `[CVE-XXXX-YYYY] (Specific Form Vulnerability)` - This represents a specific, known vulnerability in a Symfony Form component (or a related component handling form data).  The existence of a CVE indicates a publicly disclosed vulnerability, often with proof-of-concept exploits available.
*   **Attack Vector: Craft Malicious Form Input**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a specially designed form submission that exploits the specific vulnerability identified in the CVE.  This could involve manipulating input fields, hidden fields, or other form data. The vulnerability might lie in how the form component handles:
        *   File uploads (e.g., insufficient validation of file types, extensions, or content, leading to arbitrary file writes).
        *   Data type validation (e.g., failing to properly validate integer inputs, leading to type juggling issues).
        *   Specific form types or widgets (e.g., a vulnerability in a custom date/time picker).
        *   CSRF token handling (although this is more general, a Symfony-specific flaw in CSRF protection could exist).
        *   Object injection within form data (if the form data is later deserialized insecurely).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the existence of an unpatched CVE and the attacker's awareness of it).
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Potential for RCE, data modification, or other severe consequences).
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding the CVE, potentially reverse-engineering the vulnerable code, and crafting a working exploit).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires knowledge of web application vulnerabilities, Symfony internals, and potentially exploit development).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (May require intrusion detection systems with specific signatures, web application firewalls (WAFs) with custom rules, or deep code analysis).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerable Third-Party Bundle (CVE-XXXX-YYYY)](./attack_tree_paths/2__high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerable_third-party_bundle__cve-xxxx-yyyy_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** `[CVE-XXXX-YYYY] (Specific Bundle Vulnerability)` - This represents a specific, known vulnerability in a third-party bundle used by the Symfony application.
*   **Attack Vector: Craft Malicious Request to Bundle**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request (or series of requests) that targets the vulnerable functionality within the third-party bundle.  The specific nature of the request depends entirely on the vulnerability.  Examples include:
        *   Exploiting an authentication bypass in a security bundle.
        *   Triggering a file inclusion vulnerability in a bundle that handles file operations.
        *   Injecting malicious code into a bundle that uses `eval()` or similar functions insecurely.
        *   Exploiting a deserialization vulnerability in a bundle that handles user-provided data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the popularity of the bundle, the existence of an unpatched vulnerability, and the attacker's awareness).
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Potential for RCE, data breaches, privilege escalation, or other severe consequences).
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires identifying the vulnerable bundle, understanding the CVE, and crafting a working exploit).
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires knowledge of web application vulnerabilities, potentially the bundle's codebase, and exploit development).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (May require intrusion detection systems, vulnerability scanners, or manual code review).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. High-Risk Path: Abuse Debug Mode/Profiler](./attack_tree_paths/3__high-risk_path_abuse_debug_modeprofiler.md)

*   **Critical Node:** `[***Exposed Profiler***]` - This is a critical misconfiguration.  The Symfony profiler, when enabled in production, exposes a wealth of internal application information.
*   **Attack Vector: Access Sensitive Data/Code**
    *   **Description:** The attacker directly accesses the profiler's URL (typically `/app_dev.php/_profiler/` or similar, but it can be customized).  The profiler provides access to:
        *   Request and response data (including headers, cookies, and session data).
        *   Database queries (including credentials if not properly masked).
        *   Routing information.
        *   Service container configuration.
        *   Logs and error messages.
        *   Template rendering details.
        *   Potentially, the ability to execute arbitrary code through debugging tools.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Should *never* happen in production, but human error is possible).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Exposure of sensitive data, potential for RCE, complete compromise of the application).
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Simply accessing a URL).
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie (Requires minimal technical skill).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (Obvious in HTTP responses, access logs, and any monitoring system).

## Attack Tree Path: [4. High-Risk Path: Insecure Deserialization in Cache/Session](./attack_tree_paths/4__high-risk_path_insecure_deserialization_in_cachesession.md)

*   **Critical Node:** `[***Unsafe Object Injection in Cache/Session***]` - This represents a situation where the application deserializes untrusted data, allowing for object injection.
*   **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Serialized Data**
    *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates data that is eventually stored in the application's cache or session.  This could involve:
        *   Modifying session cookies.
        *   Manipulating data stored in a shared cache (e.g., Memcached, Redis) if the attacker has some level of access to the cache server.
        *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject data into the cache.
        When the application deserializes this malicious data, it creates objects with attacker-controlled properties.  If the application's code (or the code of loaded libraries) contains "magic methods" (like `__wakeup()`, `__destruct()`, `__toString()`) that perform dangerous operations based on object properties, the attacker can trigger these operations and potentially achieve RCE.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Requires specific conditions: insecure deserialization practices and the presence of exploitable magic methods).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Potential for RCE).
    *   **Effort:** High (Requires a deep understanding of PHP object serialization, the application's codebase, and potentially the code of used libraries).
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert (Requires significant expertise in PHP internals and exploit development).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires static code analysis to identify insecure deserialization, dynamic analysis to detect object injection, and potentially runtime monitoring).
