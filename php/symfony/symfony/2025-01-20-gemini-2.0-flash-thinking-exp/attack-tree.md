## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious commands into input fields or parameters that are then executed by the application's server-side code (e.g., using `exec()`, `system()`, or similar functions) without proper sanitization.
    - Potential Impact: Full control of the server, data breaches, denial of service.
    - Mitigation: Avoid executing shell commands based on user input. If necessary, use parameterized commands and strictly validate and sanitize input.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Doctrine (ORM)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_doctrine__orm_.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by manipulating input fields that are used in database interactions through Doctrine, especially when using raw SQL or insecure DQL/SQL building.
    - Potential Impact: Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    - Mitigation: Always use parameterized queries and prepared statements provided by Doctrine. Avoid raw SQL queries where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious code into template input that is then interpreted and executed by the Twig templating engine on the server. This often occurs when user-controlled data is directly embedded into templates.
    - Potential Impact: Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    - Mitigation: Avoid allowing user input directly into Twig templates. Sanitize and validate any data used in template rendering. Use a templating engine that auto-escapes by default.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_uploads.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, shell scripts) to the server, which can then be executed, leading to remote code execution.
    - Potential Impact: Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    - Mitigation: Implement strict file type validation (both client-side and server-side), sanitize file names, store uploaded files outside the web root, and configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker circumvents the application's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access. This can involve exploiting weaknesses in password hashing, session management, or "Remember Me" functionality.
        - Weak Password Hashing Algorithms: Using outdated or weak hashing algorithms makes it easier for attackers to crack passwords obtained from database breaches.
        - Session Fixation/Hijacking: Attackers can steal or manipulate session IDs to impersonate legitimate users.
    - Potential Impact: Full access to user accounts and application data.
    - Mitigation: Use strong and up-to-date password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2i). Implement secure session management practices, including regenerating session IDs on login and using secure flags. Securely configure "Remember Me" functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authorization_bypass.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker bypasses the application's authorization checks to access resources or functionalities they are not permitted to use. This can occur due to flaws in role hierarchy configurations or custom voter logic.
        - Voter Logic Flaws: Errors or oversights in custom authorization logic (voters) can allow unauthorized access.
    - Potential Impact: Access to sensitive data or functionalities, privilege escalation.
    - Mitigation: Carefully design and test role hierarchies. Thoroughly review and test custom voter logic to ensure it correctly enforces authorization rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

* Attack Vector: Sensitive configuration files (e.g., `.env` files) containing API keys, database credentials, and other secrets are exposed due to misconfigurations or insecure storage.
    - Potential Impact: Full compromise of the application and related services, data breaches.
    - Mitigation: Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools. Avoid committing sensitive data directly to the codebase. Ensure proper access controls on configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors:
        - Default/Debug Routes Exposure: Leaving debug routes enabled in production can expose sensitive information, internal application details, and even administrative functionalities.
    - Why Critical: A compromised routing system can lead to various attacks by manipulating request flow and accessing unintended functionalities. Exposing debug routes directly provides valuable information and access to attackers.
    - Mitigation: Disable debug routes in production environments. Restrict access to development/testing environments. Regularly review and secure route configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Controller Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_controller_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors: Encompasses a wide range of vulnerabilities related to how controllers handle user input, interact with services, and implement business logic (see specific high-risk paths above).
    - Why Critical: Controllers are the heart of the application logic. Vulnerabilities here can have widespread and severe consequences.
    - Mitigation: Implement secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling. Conduct thorough security code reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Input Handling](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_input_handling.md)

* Attack Vectors: Failure to properly validate and sanitize user input leads to vulnerabilities like command injection, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.
    - Why Critical: Input handling is a fundamental aspect of application security. Neglecting it opens the door to numerous attack vectors.
    - Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data. Use parameterized queries and avoid executing shell commands based on user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Templating Engine (Twig) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_templating_engine__twig__vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors: Primarily Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), where attackers can inject malicious code into templates.
    - Why Critical: Successful exploitation can lead to direct server compromise and remote code execution.
    - Mitigation: Avoid allowing user input directly into Twig templates. Sanitize and validate any data used in template rendering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Form Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_form_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors: Includes CSRF, mass assignment, and insecure file uploads (see specific high-risk path above).
    - Why Critical: Forms are a common entry point for user-supplied data and a frequent source of vulnerabilities.
    - Mitigation: Enable and properly configure CSRF protection. Explicitly define allowed fields in form types to prevent mass assignment. Implement secure file upload mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_component_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors: Weaknesses in authentication and authorization mechanisms (see specific high-risk paths above).
    - Why Critical: The security component is responsible for protecting the application's access controls. Vulnerabilities here can completely undermine security.
    - Mitigation: Use strong password hashing, secure session management, and properly configure role hierarchies and voters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors: Exposure of sensitive configuration data and the possibility of overriding configurations.
    - Why Critical: Configuration settings control the application's behavior and often contain sensitive secrets. Exposure or manipulation can lead to significant compromise.
    - Mitigation: Store sensitive configuration data securely. Restrict access to configuration files.
