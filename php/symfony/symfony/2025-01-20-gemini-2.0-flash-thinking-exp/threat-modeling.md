# Threat Model Analysis for symfony/symfony

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_twig.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Twig code into input fields or data that is later rendered by the Twig templating engine without proper escaping. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server. They might craft specific Twig syntax to access server resources or execute system commands.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Symfony Templating Component - Twig Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** directly embed user-provided data into Twig templates without proper escaping.
    *   Utilize Twig's auto-escaping feature, ensuring it's enabled and configured correctly for the context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS).
    *   Avoid using the `eval()` function or similar dynamic code execution within Twig templates.
    *   Carefully review and sanitize any data passed to Twig templates, especially from external sources.

## Threat: [Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the Symfony Dependency Injection Container to inject malicious services or manipulate existing ones. They might try to overwrite service definitions with their own malicious implementations or exploit vulnerabilities in third-party libraries registered as services.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Symfony DependencyInjection Component - ContainerBuilder, Service Definitions
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining service dependencies.
    *   Avoid injecting user-provided data directly into service constructors or methods.
    *   Regularly update all dependencies, including third-party libraries used as services.
    *   Be cautious when using dynamic service injection or factory patterns, ensuring proper validation and authorization.

## Threat: [Console Command Injection](./threats/console_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in console commands that accept user input without proper sanitization. They might inject malicious commands that are then executed on the server. This could happen if command arguments or options are not properly validated before being used in system calls.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, data manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** Symfony Console Component - Command Handlers, Input Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all user input received by console commands.
    *   Avoid directly using user input in system calls or shell commands.
    *   Use parameterized commands or escape user input properly when necessary.
    *   Restrict access to console commands to authorized users only.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive configuration parameters (e.g., database credentials, API keys, secret keys) are unintentionally exposed through environment variables, configuration files, or error messages. An attacker could gain access to this information and use it to compromise the application or related systems.
*   **Impact:** Full application compromise, access to sensitive data, unauthorized access to external services.
*   **Affected Component:** Symfony Config Component - Configuration Files, Environment Variables
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools.
    *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in configuration files.
    *   Ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive configuration details in production environments.
    *   Restrict access to configuration files and environment variable settings.
