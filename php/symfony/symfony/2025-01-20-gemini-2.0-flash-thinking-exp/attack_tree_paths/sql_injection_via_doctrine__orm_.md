### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SQL Injection via Doctrine (ORM)

**Attack Vector: An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by manipulating input fields that are used in database interactions through Doctrine, especially when using raw SQL or insecure DQL/SQL building.**

This attack vector exploits the trust placed in user-supplied data when constructing database queries. Instead of treating user input as pure data, the application inadvertently interprets parts of it as SQL commands. Doctrine ORM, while designed to abstract away direct SQL interaction, can still be vulnerable if developers resort to raw SQL or build DQL/SQL queries insecurely.

**4.1. Technical Details:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the dynamic construction of SQL queries where user-controlled input is directly concatenated into the query string. Doctrine provides mechanisms for executing raw SQL queries and building DQL (Doctrine Query Language) or SQL queries programmatically. If these mechanisms are used without proper sanitization or parameterization, they become entry points for SQL injection.

**Common Scenarios:**

* **Raw SQL Queries:** When developers use Doctrine's `EntityManager::getConnection()->executeQuery()` or similar methods to execute raw SQL, they are responsible for ensuring the safety of the query. Directly embedding user input into these queries is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.

   ```php
   // Vulnerable Example (Raw SQL)
   $username = $_GET['username'];
   $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $username . "'";
   $statement = $entityManager->getConnection()->prepare($sql);
   $statement->execute();
   ```

   In this example, if an attacker provides a malicious `username` like `' OR '1'='1`, the resulting SQL becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'`, which will return all users.

* **Insecure DQL/SQL Building:** Even when using Doctrine's query builder, vulnerabilities can arise if user input is directly incorporated without proper parameter binding.

   ```php
   // Vulnerable Example (DQL Builder)
   $search = $_GET['search'];
   $query = $entityManager->createQueryBuilder()
       ->select('u')
       ->from('App\Entity\User', 'u')
       ->where("u.name LIKE '%" . $search . "%'") // Vulnerable concatenation
       ->getQuery();
   $results = $query->getResult();
   ```

   Here, a malicious `search` value like `%'; DELETE FROM users; --` could lead to unintended database modifications.

* **Lack of Parameterization:** The fundamental flaw in both scenarios is the lack of parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements). Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code. Placeholders are used in the SQL query, and the actual values are passed separately, preventing the interpretation of malicious SQL.

**4.2. Potential Impact:**

A successful SQL injection attack via Doctrine can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breaches:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, personal data, financial records, and proprietary information.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption, loss of integrity, and disruption of services.
* **Unauthorized Access:** By manipulating queries, attackers can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, gaining access to restricted functionalities and data.
* **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers can escalate their privileges within the database system, potentially gaining full control over the database server.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious queries can be crafted to overload the database server, leading to performance degradation or complete service outage.

**4.3. Mitigation:**

The primary defense against SQL injection in Doctrine applications is the consistent use of parameterized queries and prepared statements.

* **Always Use Parameterized Queries:**  Doctrine provides robust mechanisms for parameter binding. Utilize these features when executing raw SQL or building DQL/SQL queries.

   ```php
   // Secure Example (Raw SQL with Parameter Binding)
   $username = $_GET['username'];
   $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username";
   $statement = $entityManager->getConnection()->prepare($sql);
   $statement->bindValue('username', $username);
   $statement->execute();
   ```

   ```php
   // Secure Example (DQL Builder with Parameter Binding)
   $search = $_GET['search'];
   $query = $entityManager->createQueryBuilder()
       ->select('u')
       ->from('App\Entity\User', 'u')
       ->where("u.name LIKE :search")
       ->setParameter('search', '%' . $search . '%')
       ->getQuery();
   $results = $query->getResult();
   ```

* **Avoid Raw SQL Where Possible:**  Leverage Doctrine's ORM capabilities and query builder as much as possible. These tools provide built-in protection against SQL injection when used correctly. Only resort to raw SQL when absolutely necessary and ensure meticulous parameterization.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While parameterization is the primary defense, validating and sanitizing user input can provide an additional layer of security. Validate data types, formats, and expected values. Sanitize input to remove potentially harmful characters, although be cautious with overly aggressive sanitization that might break legitimate use cases. Symfony's Form component provides excellent validation capabilities.

* **Escaping Output (Context-Aware):** While not directly preventing SQL injection, properly escaping output when displaying data retrieved from the database prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which can sometimes be chained with SQL injection.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if SQL injection is successful.

* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Utilize static analysis tools that can detect insecure query construction patterns.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application.

* **Keep Symfony and Doctrine Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Symfony and Doctrine to benefit from security patches and improvements.

**4.4. Symfony Specific Considerations:**

* **Form Handling:** Symfony's Form component provides robust mechanisms for data validation and sanitization. Utilize these features to ensure that user input is validated before being used in database queries.
* **Request Data:** Be cautious when accessing data directly from the request (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$request->query`, `$request->request`). Always validate and sanitize this data before using it in database interactions.
* **Doctrine Configuration:** Review Doctrine's configuration to ensure it is set up securely. For example, ensure that database credentials are not hardcoded and are stored securely.
* **ParamConverter:** Symfony's ParamConverter can automatically fetch entities based on route parameters. Ensure that the underlying logic doesn't introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities if the parameter values are not handled securely.

**4.5. Attack Scenarios:**

* **Manipulating Search Filters:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL into a search field, potentially bypassing the intended search logic and retrieving or modifying arbitrary data.
* **Exploiting User Profile Updates:** If user profile update forms directly use user-provided data in raw SQL queries, an attacker could inject SQL to modify other users' profiles or gain administrative privileges.
* **Bypassing Authentication:** In poorly implemented authentication systems, attackers might be able to inject SQL into login forms to bypass password checks.

**4.6. Detection and Prevention Strategies:**

* **Static Analysis Tools:** Tools like SonarQube, PHPStan, and Psalm can be configured to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by analyzing code for insecure query construction patterns.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite can be used to simulate attacks and identify SQL injection vulnerabilities in a running application.
* **Code Reviews:** Manual code reviews by security-conscious developers are crucial for identifying subtle vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
* **Security Training:** Educate developers on secure coding practices, specifically regarding SQL injection prevention in the context of Doctrine.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage external security experts to conduct penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the application.

**5. Conclusion:**

SQL Injection via Doctrine (ORM) remains a significant threat to Symfony applications if developers do not adhere to secure coding practices. The key to mitigation lies in consistently using parameterized queries and prepared statements, avoiding raw SQL where possible, and implementing robust input validation.
