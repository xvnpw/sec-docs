*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large or deeply nested input string that overwhelms the lexer's processing capabilities, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) and potentially causing the application to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **How Lexer Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The lexer's internal algorithms for tokenization might have a time complexity that scales poorly with the size or complexity of the input. Processing very long strings or deeply nested structures can exhaust resources *within the lexer itself*.
    *   **Example:**  Providing a very long string of repetitive characters or a deeply nested structure of parentheses or brackets that the lexer needs to parse.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, resource exhaustion on the server, potential service disruption for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input size limits on the data passed to the lexer.
        *   Set timeouts for lexer operations to prevent indefinite processing.
        *   Consider using techniques like iterative or streaming parsing if the lexer supports it, to avoid loading the entire input into memory at once.
        *   Monitor resource usage of the application and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

*   **Attack Surface:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    *   **Description:** The lexer internally uses regular expressions for token matching, and an attacker crafts input that exploits vulnerable regex patterns, leading to catastrophic backtracking and significant performance degradation or even hangs.
    *   **How Lexer Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the lexer's regular expressions are not carefully designed, certain input patterns can cause the regex engine *within the lexer* to explore an exponential number of possibilities, consuming excessive CPU time.
    *   **Example:** Providing input that matches a vulnerable regex pattern with overlapping or ambiguous groups, causing the regex engine to backtrack extensively.
    *   **Impact:** Severe performance degradation, application hangs, potential service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and test the lexer's internal regular expressions for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
        *   Use more efficient regex patterns or consider alternative tokenization methods if performance is critical.
        *   Implement timeouts for regex matching operations *within the lexer*.
        *   If the lexer allows user-defined token patterns, rigorously sanitize and validate these patterns to prevent the introduction of vulnerable regexes.
