**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application via Doctrine Lexer Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE):** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within the Doctrine Lexer to compromise the application.

*   **Exploit Lexer Input Handling Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH START):** This category encompasses attacks that manipulate the input provided to the Lexer to cause unintended behavior.

*   **Cause Lexer to Produce Unexpected Tokens (CRITICAL NODE):**  The attacker aims to manipulate the input in such a way that the Lexer generates tokens that are not intended by the application's logic. This can be achieved by exploiting ambiguities, edge cases, or vulnerabilities in the tokenization rules.

*   **Provide Input with Maliciously Crafted Regular Expressions (if applicable through custom rules) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If the application allows defining custom tokenization rules using regular expressions, a poorly written regex can be vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). A crafted input string can cause the regex engine to take an extremely long time to process, leading to resource exhaustion.

*   **Leverage Unexpected Tokens for Application Compromise (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** Once the Lexer produces unexpected tokens, the attacker attempts to exploit how these tokens are used by the application. This can lead to:
    *   **Unexpected tokens bypass security checks (HIGH-IMPACT):** The incorrect tokens might not be recognized or properly handled by security validation routines, allowing malicious input to pass through.
    *   **Unexpected tokens lead to incorrect program logic execution (HIGH-IMPACT):** The application's logic might misinterpret the unexpected tokens, leading to unintended code paths or incorrect data processing.
    *   **Unexpected tokens are interpreted as commands or data in downstream components (HIGH-IMPACT):** If the Lexer's output is used in contexts where it's interpreted as commands or data (e.g., in a query builder or command processor), unexpected tokens could be used for injection attacks.

*   **Cause Resource Exhaustion in the Lexer (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START):** The attacker aims to overwhelm the Lexer with input that requires excessive resources (CPU, memory) to process, leading to a denial of service.

*   **Provide Extremely Long Input Strings (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Providing exceptionally long input strings can force the Lexer to allocate excessive memory or spend a significant amount of time processing the input, leading to resource exhaustion.

*   **Leverage Resource Exhaustion for Application Compromise (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH END):** This represents the successful execution of the resource exhaustion attack, resulting in:
    *   **Denial of service due to Lexer overload (HIGH-IMPACT):** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to the Lexer consuming all available resources.

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Lexer Rules (if applicable) (HIGH-RISK PATH START):** If the application uses custom rules for tokenization, these rules themselves can be a source of vulnerabilities.

*   **Identify Weaknesses in Custom Regular Expressions (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Attackers can analyze custom regular expressions used for tokenization to find patterns that are vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting specific input strings, they can trigger exponential backtracking in the regex engine, leading to denial of service.

*   **Identify Logical Flaws in Custom Tokenizer Logic (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** If the application implements custom logic beyond simple regular expressions for tokenization, there might be logical flaws that an attacker can exploit. This can lead to:
    *   **Attacker can craft input that bypasses custom security checks (HIGH-IMPACT):** Flaws in the custom logic might allow attackers to craft input that circumvents intended security measures.
    *   **Attacker can manipulate the state of the custom tokenizer to produce desired tokens (HIGH-IMPACT):**  If the custom logic maintains state, attackers might be able to manipulate this state through carefully crafted input to force the tokenizer to produce specific, malicious tokens.
