## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Joomla CMS Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_joomla_cms_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

- The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies complete control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Joomla Core Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_joomla_core_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

- Attackers target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities within the core Joomla CMS code. Exploits are often readily available.
    - Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Joomla Core [CRITICAL NODE]: Injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate the database, potentially leading to data breaches or remote code execution.
    - Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities in Joomla Core [CRITICAL NODE]: Executing arbitrary code on the server, granting full control. This can be achieved through file upload vulnerabilities or deserialization flaws.
    - Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Joomla Core [CRITICAL NODE]: Circumventing the login process to gain unauthorized access, potentially leading to administrative control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Joomla Extensions [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_installed_joomla_extensions__high_risk_path_.md)

- Attackers target vulnerabilities within third-party Joomla extensions, which are often less rigorously tested than the core.
    - Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Extensions [CRITICAL NODE]: Similar to core SQL injection, but targeting extension-specific database interactions.
    - Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities in Extensions [CRITICAL NODE]: Similar to core RCE, but exploiting vulnerabilities within extension code.
    - Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Extensions [CRITICAL NODE]: Bypassing authentication mechanisms specific to an extension, potentially granting access to sensitive features or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Joomla Configuration and Sensitive Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/target_joomla_configuration_and_sensitive_files__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

- Attackers aim to access or modify Joomla's configuration file (`configuration.php`) or other sensitive files.
    - Exploit Vulnerabilities to Read `configuration.php` [CRITICAL NODE]: Using LFI/RFI or other vulnerabilities to access the configuration file, revealing database credentials and other sensitive information.
    - Exploit Vulnerabilities to Write to `configuration.php` [CRITICAL NODE]: Utilizing vulnerabilities to modify the configuration file, potentially changing database settings, administrator passwords, or injecting malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Joomla Administrator Account [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_joomla_administrator_account__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

- Attackers seek to gain access to a Joomla administrator account, which provides full control over the application.
    - Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Login Process [CRITICAL NODE]: Exploiting flaws in the login mechanism to bypass authentication.
    - Brute-Force Administrator Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]: Attempting multiple login attempts with common or leaked credentials. While potentially detectable, it's a direct path to compromise if weak passwords are used.
    - Exploit Session Management Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]: Hijacking or manipulating administrator session cookies to gain unauthorized access without needing credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default or Weak Credentials [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_or_weak_credentials__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

- Attackers utilize default or easily guessable credentials for administrator or database accounts if they haven't been changed. This is a low-effort, high-impact attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Joomla Update Process [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_joomla_update_process__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

- Attackers target vulnerabilities in the Joomla update process itself.
    - Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Update: Intercepting and modifying update packages to inject malicious code.
    - Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Update Mechanism: Triggering vulnerabilities during the update process to gain control.
