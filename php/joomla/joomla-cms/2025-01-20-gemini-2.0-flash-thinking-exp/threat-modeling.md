# Threat Model Analysis for joomla/joomla-cms

## Threat: [Unpatched Joomla Core Vulnerability](./threats/unpatched_joomla_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Unpatched Joomla Core Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a publicly known security vulnerability within the core Joomla codebase that has not been patched on the application. They exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the application, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control. This could involve exploiting flaws in core components responsible for routing, input handling, or database interactions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including access to the database, ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, data breaches, and defacement of the website.
    *   **Affected Joomla Component:** Joomla Core (various components depending on the specific vulnerability, e.g., router, input filters, database abstraction layer, session management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain the Joomla core at the latest stable version.
        *   Subscribe to Joomla security announcements and apply patches immediately upon release.
        *   Implement a system for regularly checking for and applying Joomla updates.
        *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) with rules to mitigate known Joomla core vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerability in Joomla Core](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerability_in_joomla_core.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection Vulnerability in Joomla Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries that exploit vulnerabilities in the Joomla core's database interaction logic. This occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in SQL queries executed by the core.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification or deletion of data within the Joomla database, potential for gaining administrative access if the database user has sufficient privileges.
    *   **Affected Joomla Component:** Joomla Core (database abstraction layer, specific core components handling database queries based on user input).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the Joomla core is updated to the latest version, as core SQL injection vulnerabilities are typically addressed quickly.
        *   Avoid modifying core Joomla files, as this can introduce vulnerabilities and complicate updates.
        *   Report any suspected SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Joomla core to the Joomla security team.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability in Joomla Core](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability_in_joomla_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability in Joomla Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the Joomla core that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could involve vulnerabilities in file handling, unserialization of data, or other core functionalities.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to install malware, steal sensitive data, or use the server for malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Joomla Component:** Joomla Core (various components depending on the specific vulnerability, e.g., file upload handlers, unserialize functions, template rendering engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain the Joomla core at the latest stable version.
        *   Implement strong server security measures, such as restricting file permissions and disabling unnecessary services.
        *   Monitor server logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Joomla Core](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerability_in_joomla_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass Vulnerability in Joomla Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in Joomla's authentication mechanisms, allowing them to bypass the normal login process and gain unauthorized access to user accounts or the administrative backend.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of user data. If administrative access is gained, the attacker can completely compromise the application.
    *   **Affected Joomla Component:** Joomla Core (authentication system, user management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain the Joomla core at the latest stable version.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts.
        *   Consider implementing two-factor authentication for administrator logins.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Joomla Core](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerability_in_joomla_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Joomla Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into web pages served by the Joomla core. This occurs when the core fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it on the page.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the website, theft of sensitive information from the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Joomla Component:** Joomla Core (components responsible for rendering user-generated content or handling user input, template engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain the Joomla core at the latest stable version.
        *   Utilize Joomla's built-in security features for XSS protection.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
