# Attack Surface Analysis for joomla/joomla-cms

## Attack Surface: [1. Core CMS Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__core_cms_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Security flaws present in the core Joomla CMS code itself. These are inherent vulnerabilities within the main Joomla software.
*   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla, being a complex CMS, has a large codebase that can contain vulnerabilities. Exploiting these core flaws directly targets the heart of the application.
*   **Example:** A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a core Joomla component allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted request.
*   **Impact:** Full website compromise, complete data breach, server takeover, defacement, denial of service, installation of backdoors.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately Apply Core Updates:**  Monitor Joomla release channels and apply core security updates and patches as soon as they are released. Automate update processes where possible.
    *   **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF to detect and block exploit attempts targeting known Joomla core vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct professional security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address potential core vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.

## Attack Surface: [2. Third-Party Extension Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__third-party_extension_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Security flaws within extensions (plugins, modules, components, templates) installed on Joomla, developed by third-party developers.
*   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla's architecture relies heavily on extensions for extended functionality. The vast ecosystem of third-party extensions introduces a significant attack surface due to varying security quality and update practices.
*   **Example:** A popular Joomla component for image galleries contains an unpatched SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker exploits this to extract sensitive database information, including user credentials.
*   **Impact:** Website compromise, data breach, defacement, spam injection, remote code execution (depending on the extension and vulnerability), privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the extension's function and the vulnerability type).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize Extensions from Reputable Sources:** Install extensions only from the official Joomla Extensions Directory (JED) or trusted, well-known developers. Check reviews and ratings.
    *   **Maintain Up-to-Date Extensions:**  Rigorously keep all installed extensions updated to their latest versions. Enable update notifications and apply updates promptly.
    *   **Minimize Extension Usage:**  Remove and uninstall any extensions that are not actively used or essential to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Regularly Audit Extensions:** Periodically review installed extensions and assess their security posture. Consider security scanning tools or professional audits for critical extensions.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insecure Joomla Configuration](./attack_surfaces/3__insecure_joomla_configuration.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations within the Joomla CMS settings itself, leading to security weaknesses.
*   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla offers numerous configuration options, and incorrect settings can directly expose critical vulnerabilities within the CMS. Default configurations are often not secure enough for production.
*   **Example:** Using default administrator credentials (`admin`/`password`) for the Joomla administrator account, allowing attackers to easily gain administrative access through brute-force attacks.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized administrative access, complete website takeover, data modification, malware injection, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific misconfiguration).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Change Default Administrator Credentials Immediately:** Set strong, unique passwords for all administrator accounts upon installation.
    *   **Disable Debug Mode in Production:** Ensure debug mode is disabled in Joomla's global configuration for live websites to prevent information disclosure.
    *   **Restrict Administrator Access:** Limit access to the Joomla administrator panel by IP address whitelisting or implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator logins.
    *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Configure Joomla to enforce strong password policies for all user accounts, including administrators.
    *   **Review and Harden Joomla Configuration:** Regularly review all Joomla configuration settings and harden them according to security best practices, disabling unnecessary features and services.

## Attack Surface: [4. Template Vulnerabilities Leading to XSS or Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/4__template_vulnerabilities_leading_to_xss_or_code_injection.md)

Description: Security flaws within the Joomla template code that can be exploited to inject malicious scripts or code into the website.
*   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla templates control the website's presentation and interact with user input. Vulnerabilities in templates can directly lead to client-side attacks like XSS or, in severe cases, server-side code injection.
*   **Example:** A Joomla template fails to properly sanitize user input displayed in a search results page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript that executes when other users view the page (Stored XSS).
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, session hijacking, potentially leading to more severe attacks if code injection is possible.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (for XSS) to **Critical** (for code injection).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure and Reputable Templates:** Choose templates from trusted developers or marketplaces known for security and code quality.
    *   **Keep Templates Updated:** Regularly update templates to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of Templates:** Conduct security audits, especially for custom templates, to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities related to input handling and output encoding.
    *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP headers to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load.
