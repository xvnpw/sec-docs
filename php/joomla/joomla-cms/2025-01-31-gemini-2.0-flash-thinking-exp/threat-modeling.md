# Threat Model Analysis for joomla/joomla-cms

## Threat: [Outdated Joomla Core Vulnerability](./threats/outdated_joomla_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in an outdated Joomla core version. They can use publicly available exploit code to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, deface the website, or steal sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Website compromise, data breach, malware distribution, reputational damage, service disruption.
*   **Joomla Component Affected:** Joomla Core (various components depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Joomla core to the latest stable version.
    *   Subscribe to Joomla security mailing lists or follow official Joomla security channels for vulnerability announcements.
    *   Implement a patch management process to promptly apply security updates.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Extension (Remote Code Execution - RCE)](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_extension__remote_code_execution_-_rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a third-party Joomla extension. They can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining complete control over the web server and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, malware distribution, complete website takeover, significant reputational damage, service disruption.
*   **Joomla Component Affected:** Specific third-party extension (component, module, plugin, or template) vulnerable to RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise extreme caution when installing third-party extensions.
    *   Prioritize extensions from the Joomla Extensions Directory with good reviews and active development.
    *   Keep all extensions updated.
    *   Regularly scan extensions for vulnerabilities using security scanning tools.
    *   Implement server-level security measures to limit the impact of RCE, such as least privilege principles and intrusion detection systems.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Extension (SQL Injection)](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_extension__sql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits an SQL injection vulnerability in a poorly coded third-party Joomla extension (component, module, plugin, or template). They can manipulate database queries to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or potentially gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, website compromise, unauthorized access, reputational damage.
*   **Joomla Component Affected:** Specific third-party extension (component, module, plugin, or template) vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install extensions from reputable and trusted sources (Joomla Extensions Directory, well-known developers).
    *   Regularly update all installed extensions to the latest versions.
    *   Review extension code for security vulnerabilities if possible, or use security scanning tools.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.
    *   Implement least privilege database access for Joomla.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in a Joomla Template](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_a_joomla_template.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a website page through an XSS vulnerability in a Joomla template. When other users visit the affected page, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website for visitors.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, website defacement for visitors, malware distribution, reputational damage.
*   **Joomla Component Affected:** Joomla Template (template files, template code).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use templates from reputable sources.
    *   Ensure templates are properly coded to sanitize user input and escape output to prevent XSS.
    *   Regularly update templates.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   Educate content editors about the risks of pasting content from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attack on Joomla Administrator Login](./threats/brute-force_attack_on_joomla_administrator_login.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker attempts to guess administrator login credentials by repeatedly trying different username and password combinations on the Joomla administrator login page (`/administrator`). If successful, they gain full administrative access to the Joomla backend.
*   **Impact:** Full website compromise, data breach, website defacement, malware distribution, service disruption.
*   **Joomla Component Affected:** Joomla Administrator Login Page (`/administrator`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong and unique passwords for administrator accounts.
    *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for administrator logins.
    *   Rename or move the default administrator login page (though this is security by obscurity and less effective than other measures).
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block brute-force attempts.
    *   Monitor login attempts and investigate suspicious activity.
