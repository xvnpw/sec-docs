# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
 - Provide a flexible and user-friendly open-source Content Management System (CMS).
 - Enable users to build and manage websites and online applications of various types and sizes.
 - Maintain a large and active community of users and developers.
 - Ensure the platform is extensible and adaptable to evolving web technologies and user needs.
 - Offer a stable, reliable, and secure platform for website operation.
- Most important business risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the CMS core or extensions leading to website compromise, data breaches, or reputational damage.
 - Availability issues due to software bugs, infrastructure problems, or security attacks, impacting website accessibility and business operations.
 - Data integrity concerns arising from software defects, unauthorized access, or malicious activities, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
 - Community fragmentation or decline in contributions, hindering the project's long-term viability and innovation.
 - Compatibility issues with new technologies or changing web standards, making the CMS outdated or less competitive.

# SECURITY POSTURE

 - security control: Input validation and sanitization within the CMS core to prevent common web vulnerabilities. (Codebase and security guidelines)
 - security control: Access control mechanisms for user roles and permissions within the CMS administration panel. (Joomla documentation and codebase)
 - security control: Use of prepared statements and database abstraction layers to mitigate SQL injection risks. (Codebase and development best practices)
 - security control: Security-focused development practices within the core development team. (Implied by the project's maturity and security record)
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community-developed extensions, which may have varying levels of security. (Acknowledged in Joomla documentation and extension ecosystem)
 - accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by users leading to security vulnerabilities. (Addressed through documentation and best practices guides)
 - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components used by Joomla. (Addressed through dependency management and updates)
- Recommended security controls:
 - security control: Automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) integrated into the development and release pipeline.
 - security control: Regular penetration testing by external security experts.
 - security control: Security awareness training for core developers and extension developers.
 - security control: Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for monitoring and alerting on security events in deployed Joomla instances (for joomla.org infrastructure).
 - security control: Enhance input validation and output encoding across the entire CMS, including extensions API.
- Security requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanism for administrative users to prevent unauthorized access to CMS backend.
  - Requirement: Option for multi-factor authentication for administrative users.
  - Requirement: Secure password storage using strong hashing algorithms.

  - Requirement: Granular permission management for different areas of the CMS and extensions.
  - Requirement: Principle of least privilege applied to user roles and system processes.
 - Input validation:
  - Requirement: Comprehensive input validation for all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
  - Requirement: Server-side validation as primary defense, with client-side validation for user experience.
  - Requirement: Validation applied at all layers of the application, including API endpoints and database interactions.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Use of strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit (e.g., passwords, user data, session tokens).
  - Requirement: Secure key management practices for cryptographic keys.
  - Requirement: HTTPS enforced for all communication between users and the CMS.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
 - Website availability and accessibility for end-users.
 - Content management and publishing workflows for administrators.
 - Data integrity and confidentiality of website content and user data.
 - Reputation and trust in the Joomla platform.
 - Security of the Joomla infrastructure (joomla.org and related services).
- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
 - Website content (text, images, media): Moderate sensitivity, integrity and availability are key.
 - User accounts (usernames, emails, roles): Moderate to high sensitivity, confidentiality and integrity are important.
 - User passwords: High sensitivity, confidentiality and integrity are critical.
 - Session data: Moderate sensitivity, confidentiality and integrity are important during active sessions.
 - Configuration data (database credentials, API keys): High sensitivity, confidentiality and integrity are critical.
 - Logs (access logs, error logs): Low to moderate sensitivity, integrity and availability are useful for auditing and troubleshooting.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the process for vetting and approving Joomla extensions in the official directory?
 - Are there specific security guidelines or training provided to Joomla extension developers?
 - What is the typical update frequency for Joomla core and extensions security patches?
 - Is there a bug bounty program or vulnerability disclosure process for Joomla?
 - What are the key performance and scalability requirements for a typical Joomla deployment?
 - What is the expected lifespan and support cycle for different Joomla versions?
- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: Joomla's primary business goal is to maintain a widely used and trusted open-source CMS. Security and stability are crucial for user adoption and community health.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Joomla has established security practices, but relies heavily on community contributions and user responsibility for secure deployments. Security is a continuous effort with ongoing improvements.
 - DESIGN: The design is based on a traditional three-tier web application architecture (web server, application server, database). Deployment is flexible and can range from shared hosting to cloud-based infrastructure. The build process is automated using CI/CD principles and includes basic security checks.
