## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Joomla Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_joomla_core_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **SQL Injection:**
        * Identifying vulnerable input parameters in URLs, forms, or other data entry points.
        * Crafting and injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate the database. This can lead to data breaches, account takeover, and even remote code execution in some cases.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
        * Identifying vulnerable code paths that allow the execution of arbitrary code. This can involve insecure file uploads, deserialization flaws, or other vulnerabilities in the core Joomla codebase.
        * Uploading or triggering the execution of malicious code on the server, granting the attacker complete control.
    * **Authentication Bypass:**
        * Identifying flaws in the Joomla authentication logic.
        * Exploiting these flaws to bypass the login mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Joomla Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_joomla_extensions.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Identify vulnerable installed extension:**
        * Scanning the installed Joomla extensions for known vulnerabilities using automated tools or manual analysis of extension code. Public databases of known vulnerabilities are often used for this purpose.
    * **Exploit identified vulnerability:**
        * Once a vulnerable extension is identified, attackers leverage known exploits or develop new ones to compromise the application. The specific attack vectors depend on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, RCE, XSS within the extension).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Joomla Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_joomla_configuration_weaknesses.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Default or Weak Administrator Credentials:**
        * Attempting to log in using common default usernames and passwords that are often not changed after installation.
        * Performing brute-force attacks to guess administrator login credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Joomla's Plugin/Module System](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_joomla's_pluginmodule_system.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Install Malicious Plugin/Module:**
        * Tricking administrators into installing malicious extensions disguised as legitimate ones. This can be done through social engineering, compromised marketplaces, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the extension installation process itself. Once installed, the malicious extension can perform various harmful actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting Joomla Administrators](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_joomla_administrators.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Phishing for Administrator Credentials:**
        * Crafting convincing phishing emails or websites that mimic the Joomla login page or other legitimate services.
        * Tricking administrators into revealing their login credentials through these deceptive methods.
