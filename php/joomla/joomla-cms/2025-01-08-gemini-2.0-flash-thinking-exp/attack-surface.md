# Attack Surface Analysis for joomla/joomla-cms

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into data inputs, allowing them to manipulate the database.
    *   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla's database abstraction layer (JDatabase) and reliance on extensions can introduce vulnerabilities if input sanitization and parameterized queries are not consistently implemented in the core and within extensions. Older versions or poorly coded extensions are particularly susceptible.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable Joomla component might directly embed user-supplied data into a SQL query without proper escaping, like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$_GET[username]'`. An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication.
    *   **Impact:**  Full database compromise, including reading sensitive data (user credentials, personal information), modifying data, or even deleting tables.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database. Properly sanitize and validate all user inputs. Regularly update Joomla core and all extensions. Conduct security code reviews. Utilize Joomla's built-in security functions for database interaction.
        *   **Users:** Keep Joomla core and extensions updated. Avoid installing extensions from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla's templating system, core components, and extensions can introduce XSS vulnerabilities if user-supplied data is not properly escaped before being displayed in the browser. This can occur in various parts of the application, including article content, comments, or extension outputs.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable Joomla module might display user-submitted comments without encoding HTML entities. An attacker could submit a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which would execute in the browsers of other users viewing the page.
    *   **Impact:**  Session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, information theft, and potentially delivering malware to users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement proper output encoding (escaping) for all user-supplied data before displaying it on web pages. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript encoding). Regularly update Joomla core and extensions.
        *   **Users:** Keep Joomla core and extensions updated. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Joomla application.
    *   **Joomla Contribution:**  Critical vulnerabilities in the Joomla core or extensions, often related to insecure file handling (e.g., file uploads without proper validation), deserialization of untrusted data, or command injection flaws, can lead to RCE.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable Joomla extension might allow uploading arbitrary files without proper checks. An attacker could upload a PHP shell script and then execute it by accessing its URL.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the server, allowing attackers to control the system, steal data, install malware, or use it as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly validate all file uploads, restricting file types and sizes. Avoid deserializing untrusted data. Sanitize input used in system commands. Regularly update Joomla core and extensions. Conduct rigorous security testing.
        *   **Users:** Keep Joomla core and extensions updated. Only install extensions from trusted and reputable sources. Implement strong server security measures.

## Attack Surface: [Extension Vulnerabilities (High and Critical)](./attack_surfaces/extension_vulnerabilities__high_and_critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in third-party components, modules, and plugins used within Joomla that have a high or critical severity.
    *   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla's architecture encourages the use of extensions to expand functionality. The security of these extensions varies greatly depending on the developers and their security practices. High and critical vulnerabilities in extensions are a significant entry point for attackers.
    *   **Example:** A popular Joomla component might have an unpatched SQL injection or RCE vulnerability that attackers can exploit, even if the Joomla core is up-to-date.
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from significant data breaches and unauthorized access to full system compromise, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical, High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Follow secure coding practices when developing extensions. Regularly update and patch extensions. Provide clear security advisories for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:**  Only install extensions from trusted and reputable sources (e.g., the official Joomla Extensions Directory). Regularly update all installed extensions. Remove any unused or outdated extensions. Monitor security advisories for installed extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to restricted areas or functionalities of the Joomla application.
    *   **Joomla Contribution:**  Vulnerabilities in Joomla's authentication mechanisms (e.g., weak password hashing, flawed session management) or authorization logic (e.g., improper access controls) can allow attackers to bypass login procedures or escalate privileges.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable Joomla component might not properly verify user roles before granting access to administrative functions, allowing a regular user to perform administrative actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of content, manipulation of user accounts, and potentially full control of the Joomla site.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Use strong password hashing algorithms. Implement robust session management with appropriate timeouts and regeneration. Enforce proper access controls and role-based authorization. Regularly update Joomla core.
        *   **Users:** Use strong and unique passwords for all user accounts, especially administrator accounts. Enable two-factor authentication where available. Regularly review user permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Administrative Interface Brute-Force Attacks](./attack_surfaces/administrative_interface_brute-force_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess administrator login credentials by trying numerous combinations of usernames and passwords.
    *   **Joomla Contribution:** The Joomla administrator login page (`/administrator`) is a well-known target. Without proper protection, it's vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Example:** Attackers use automated tools to repeatedly try different username and password combinations against the Joomla administrator login form.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful brute-force attacks can grant attackers full administrative access to the Joomla site.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts. Consider using CAPTCHA on the login form.
        *   **Users:** Use strong and unique passwords for administrator accounts. Enable two-factor authentication for administrator logins. Consider using IP address whitelisting or limiting access to the administrative interface.
