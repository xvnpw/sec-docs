# Threat Model Analysis for joomla/joomla-cms

## Threat: [Joomla Core Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/joomla_core_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability directly within the Joomla core codebase to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could involve manipulating input parameters processed by core functions, exploiting insecure deserialization within the framework, or leveraging flaws in specific core API endpoints.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Joomla installation and the underlying server, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data managed by Joomla, install malware affecting the server, deface the website controlled by Joomla, or utilize the server for further malicious activities.
*   **Affected Component:** Various core components depending on the specific vulnerability, including but not limited to:
    *   **Libraries:** Certain fundamental Joomla libraries containing vulnerable functions.
    *   **Framework:** Flaws within the core Joomla framework itself.
    *   **API Endpoints:** Security weaknesses in Joomla's built-in API functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain Up-to-Date Joomla Core:**  Immediately apply security patches by upgrading to the latest stable Joomla version.
    *   **Implement a Rigorous Patching Process:** Establish a well-defined procedure for promptly installing security updates.
    *   **Conduct Regular Security Audits of Core Code:** Perform thorough security assessments of the Joomla core codebase for potential vulnerabilities (though this is primarily for the Joomla development team).
    *   **Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF configured with rules to detect and block known exploits targeting Joomla core vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Controls in Joomla Core Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/insufficient_access_controls_in_joomla_core_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit flaws or misconfigurations within Joomla's core Access Control List (ACL) system to gain unauthorized access to higher-level privileges. This could involve manipulating user group assignments or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Joomla handles permission checks within its core functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can elevate their privileges to administrator level, allowing them to perform administrative tasks, modify sensitive data managed by Joomla, install malicious extensions, and ultimately compromise the entire Joomla installation.
*   **Affected Component:** Joomla's core Access Control List (ACL) system and related core functions responsible for user authentication and authorization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Configuration of Joomla ACLs:**  Meticulously configure user groups and permissions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Regular Auditing of User Permissions:**  Periodically review and verify user roles and their assigned permissions within Joomla's core ACL system.
    *   **Restrict Super User Access:** Limit the number of users with super user privileges.
    *   **Monitor User Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect suspicious privilege escalation attempts.
    *   **Apply Security Updates:** Ensure the Joomla core is up-to-date, as updates often include fixes for ACL-related vulnerabilities.
