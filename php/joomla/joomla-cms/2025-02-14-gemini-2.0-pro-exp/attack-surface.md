# Attack Surface Analysis for joomla/joomla-cms

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass / Brute-Force (Joomla-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass__brute-force__joomla-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Joomla administrator panel by guessing credentials or exploiting weaknesses in Joomla's authentication process.
*   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla provides a standard login interface (`/administrator`) which is a well-known and frequently targeted entry point. The core authentication system, while generally robust, can be vulnerable if misconfigured, if older unpatched versions are used, or if weak extensions related to authentication are present.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a dictionary attack against the `/administrator` login page, or exploits a vulnerability in a third-party Joomla authentication plugin to bypass login.
*   **Impact:** Complete site compromise, data theft, defacement, malware injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity) within Joomla's user management.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement and *require* 2FA for all administrator accounts using Joomla's built-in 2FA or a reputable extension.
    *   **Account Lockout:** Configure Joomla's built-in account lockout feature to prevent sustained brute-force attempts.
    *   **Rename Administrator Path:** Change the default `/administrator` path using a third-party extension or .htaccess rules (this is a Joomla-specific mitigation).
    *   **Monitor Login Attempts:** Regularly review Joomla's logs for failed login attempts and suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Core or Extensions (Joomla-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__in_core_or_extensions__joomla-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Joomla's core code or, *more frequently*, in third-party extensions to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla's core, while actively maintained, can have undiscovered vulnerabilities. However, the *primary* RCE risk comes from the vast ecosystem of third-party extensions, which may have poor coding practices, unpatched vulnerabilities, or be abandoned by their developers. Joomla's extension management system itself is a potential attack vector if compromised.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an outdated Joomla component to upload a PHP shell, or a zero-day vulnerability in a popular extension allows for arbitrary code execution through a crafted URL.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data theft, malware distribution, use of the server for malicious activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Joomla and Extensions Updated:** This is the *absolute most critical* mitigation.  Apply all security updates for Joomla core and *all* installed extensions immediately.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Joomla installation (including all extensions) for known vulnerabilities using specialized Joomla security scanners.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF configured with rules specific to Joomla to block common RCE attack patterns.
    *   **Secure File Uploads:** If file uploads are allowed (through core or extensions), implement *extremely* strict validation of file types, sizes, and content. Store uploaded files outside the web root if possible, and use Joomla's built-in file handling functions.
    *   **Carefully Vet Extensions:** *Thoroughly* research extensions before installing.  Prioritize extensions from reputable developers with a history of security updates.  Consider code review if feasible.
    *   **Remove Unused Extensions:** Uninstall any extensions that are not absolutely necessary.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Joomla Functionality:** If certain core Joomla features or extension functionalities are not needed, disable them to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (SQLi) in Extensions (Joomla-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__sqli__in_extensions__joomla-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, primarily through vulnerabilities in third-party Joomla extensions.
*   **Joomla Contribution:** While Joomla's core database abstraction layer (JDatabase) is designed to prevent SQLi, *extensions that bypass JDatabase or use raw SQL queries are at high risk*.  The core itself is significantly less likely to be vulnerable, but the *interaction points* between the core and extensions are part of the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a URL parameter in a poorly coded custom Joomla component to inject SQL code that retrieves user credentials from the database.
*   **Impact:** Data theft (user credentials, personal information, etc.), database modification, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Use of JDatabase:** Developers of Joomla extensions *must* use Joomla's JDatabase API for *all* database interactions and *never* write raw SQL queries.
    *   **Prepared Statements:** Enforce the use of prepared statements (parameterized queries) within JDatabase to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Input Validation (Extension Level):** Extension developers must thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied data before using it in database queries, *even when using JDatabase*.
    *   **Keep Extensions Updated:** Apply security updates for *all* installed extensions promptly.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF with Joomla-specific rules can help detect and block SQLi attempts.
    *   **Database User Permissions (Joomla Context):** Configure the Joomla database user with the *least privileges necessary* for the application to function.  Do *not* use the database root user.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Extensions (Joomla-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_extensions__joomla-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Extensions (components, modules, plugins, templates) from third-party developers introduce a wide range of vulnerabilities, including RCE, SQLi, XSS, and others.
*   **Joomla Contribution:** Joomla's extensibility is a core feature, but the reliance on third-party code significantly expands the attack surface.  The quality and security of extensions vary dramatically.  Joomla's extension directory (JED) provides a central repository, but it doesn't guarantee security.
*   **Example:** An outdated, vulnerable Joomla extension is exploited to gain administrator access, leading to complete site compromise.  Or, a malicious extension is installed, either through social engineering or by exploiting a vulnerability in the Joomla extension manager.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability within the extension, ranging from minor information disclosure to complete site and server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the extension and its vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Reputable Sources:** *Only* install extensions from trusted sources (e.g., the official Joomla Extensions Directory (JED), well-known and reputable developers).
    *   **Keep Extensions Updated:** Regularly update *all* installed extensions to their latest versions.  This is *crucial*.
    *   **Vulnerability Research:** Before installing *any* extension, research it for known vulnerabilities.  Check the JED, developer websites, and security forums.
    *   **Code Review (if feasible):** If you have the necessary expertise, perform a security code review of extensions before deploying them, especially for critical functionality.
    *   **Remove Unused Extensions:** Uninstall any extensions that are not actively used and essential to the site's functionality.
    *   **Monitor Extension Activity:** Be aware of the permissions and functionality of installed extensions.  Use Joomla's built-in features or security extensions to monitor for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File and Directory Permissions (Joomla Installation Specific)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_and_directory_permissions__joomla_installation_specific_.md)

* **Description:** Incorrectly configured file and directory permissions on the Joomla installation files and directories.
* **Joomla Contribution:** While Joomla's installation process *attempts* to set secure permissions, manual changes after installation, server misconfigurations, or issues in shared hosting environments can lead to insecure permissions that are exploitable *because of how Joomla uses those files*.
* **Example:** The `configuration.php` file (containing Joomla's database credentials) is world-readable, allowing any user on the server (or potentially external attackers) to access the database. Or, the `/administrator/components` directory is writable by the web server user, allowing an attacker who has compromised a component to modify other components.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files (including configuration files), code execution, data modification, complete system compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Follow Joomla's Official Recommendations:** Adhere strictly to Joomla's documented recommended file and directory permissions.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant *only* the absolutely necessary permissions to files and directories. The web server user should generally only have write access to specific directories (e.g., `/tmp`, `/cache`, `/images`, and potentially specific extension directories *if required by the extension*).
    * **Regular Audits:** Periodically check file and directory permissions to ensure they remain secure, especially after updates or changes to the Joomla installation.
    * **Avoid Shared Hosting (if high security is required):** Shared hosting environments often have less granular control over file permissions. Consider using a VPS or dedicated server for better security and control.
    * **Use a Joomla Security Extension:** Some Joomla security extensions can help monitor and manage file permissions, alerting you to potential issues.
