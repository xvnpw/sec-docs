# Threat Model Analysis for joomla/joomla-cms

## Threat: [Extension Vulnerability Exploitation (SQL Injection)](./threats/extension_vulnerability_exploitation__sql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in a *third-party component* (e.g., a poorly coded contact form component). The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries that are executed by the component, bypassing Joomla's core database abstraction layer *because the extension developer did not use Joomla's API correctly*. This is *not* a general SQLi; it's specific to the extension's flawed handling of user input *within the Joomla environment*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach: The attacker can read, modify, or delete data from the database, including user credentials, content, and configuration settings.
    *   Complete site takeover: If the attacker gains administrator credentials, they can control the entire site.
    *   Database corruption: Malicious queries could damage or destroy the database.
*   **Affected Joomla Component:** Third-party component (e.g., `com_vulnerablecontactform`), specifically the component's database interaction logic *that fails to utilize Joomla's secure API*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Use Joomla's database API (`JDatabaseDriver`) *correctly and consistently* for all database interactions.  *Never* use direct SQL queries.  Always use prepared statements with parameterized queries.
        *   Sanitize and validate *all* user input before using it in database queries, *even when using the Joomla API*.  This is a defense-in-depth measure.
        *   Follow secure coding practices specific to Joomla extension development.
    *   **User:**
        *   Install only reputable extensions from trusted sources (JED with good reviews, well-known developers).  Due diligence is crucial.
        *   Keep *all* extensions updated to the latest versions.  This is the most important mitigation.
        *   Regularly audit installed extensions for vulnerabilities (if you have the technical expertise).
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with Joomla-specific rules to provide an additional layer of defense.

## Threat: [Extension Vulnerability Exploitation (File Upload)](./threats/extension_vulnerability_exploitation__file_upload_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a *third-party module* (e.g., an image gallery module) that allows arbitrary file uploads. The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file disguised as an image, which is then executed by the web server. This leverages Joomla's extension architecture to bypass standard file upload restrictions *because the extension does not properly validate uploaded files*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Complete site takeover: The attacker gains full control of the website and potentially the server.
    *   Malware distribution: The site can be used to host and distribute malware.
*   **Affected Joomla Component:** Third-party module (e.g., `mod_vulnerablegallery`), specifically the module's file upload handling logic *that fails to use Joomla's file validation features*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Validate file types *extremely strictly*, using both file extension checks and MIME type verification (using Joomla's `JFile` class *correctly*).  Do not rely on user-provided file extensions.
        *   Store uploaded files *outside* the web root, if at all possible. This is the most secure approach.
        *   If files *must* be stored in the web root, use a `.htaccess` file to prevent direct execution of PHP files in the upload directory.  This is a crucial mitigation.
        *   Rename uploaded files to random, unpredictable filenames to prevent direct access attacks.
        *   Use Joomla's media manager API where appropriate and *configure it securely*.
    *   **User:**
        *   Install only reputable extensions from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all extensions updated to the latest versions.
        *   Configure the extension (if possible) to restrict file types and sizes to the absolute minimum necessary.

## Threat: [Core Joomla Vulnerability Exploitation (Known CVE)](./threats/core_joomla_vulnerability_exploitation__known_cve_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *known, publicly disclosed vulnerability (CVE)* in the *Joomla core* (e.g., a vulnerability in the user authentication process, a specific core component). The attacker uses a publicly available exploit or crafts their own based on the CVE details. This targets a *specific, unpatched version of Joomla*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Varies depending on the specific CVE, but can range from information disclosure to *complete site takeover*.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Defacement.
*   **Affected Joomla Component:** Specific core Joomla component or function identified in the CVE (e.g., `JUser` class, a specific controller, a core library).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if unpatched)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **User:**
        *   Apply Joomla core updates *immediately* upon release. This is the *single most important* mitigation for core vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to Joomla security announcements to be notified of new vulnerabilities.
        *   Use a WAF to help mitigate zero-day exploits (although this is not a substitute for patching).
        *   Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production to avoid compatibility issues.

## Threat: [Joomla Configuration Misconfiguration (Installation Directory)](./threats/joomla_configuration_misconfiguration__installation_directory_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker accesses the `/installation` directory, which was *not removed* after the Joomla installation was completed. This directory may contain sensitive information or allow the attacker to re-run the installation process, potentially overwriting the existing installation. This is a *direct* result of failing to follow Joomla's installation instructions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure: The attacker may gain access to database credentials or other sensitive information.
    *   Site takeover: The attacker might be able to re-install Joomla and gain complete control.
*   **Affected Joomla Component:** Joomla installation process; the `/installation` directory itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **User:**
        *   Delete the `/installation` directory *immediately* after completing the Joomla installation. This is a fundamental security step.

## Threat: [Joomla Configuration Misconfiguration (Weak Admin Password)](./threats/joomla_configuration_misconfiguration__weak_admin_password_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Joomla administrator panel (`/administrator`) by guessing or brute-forcing a *weak administrator password*. This directly targets Joomla's authentication mechanism.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete site takeover: The attacker has full control over the site's content, configuration, and extensions.
*   **Affected Joomla Component:** Joomla administrator login (`/administrator`); `JUser` authentication system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **User:**
        *   Use a *strong, unique password* for the administrator account (and all user accounts).
        *   Enable *two-factor authentication (2FA)* for all administrator accounts. This is a critical mitigation.
        *   Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Consider renaming the `/administrator` path to something less predictable (although this is security through obscurity and not a primary defense).
