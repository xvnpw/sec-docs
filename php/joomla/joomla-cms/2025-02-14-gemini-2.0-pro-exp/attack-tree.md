## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known Joomla Vulnerability (CVE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_joomla_vulnerability__cve_.md)

*   **1. Exploit Known Joomla Vulnerability (CVE)**

    *   **1a. Exploit Unpatched Core Vulnerability (e.g., RCE) -> HIGH RISK -> [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker leverages a publicly known and unpatched vulnerability in the Joomla core code (e.g., a Remote Code Execution vulnerability) to gain control of the system.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if unpatched), Very Low (if patched promptly)
        *   **Impact:** Very High - RCE allows complete system compromise.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Public exploits are often available.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Script kiddies can use public exploits; more sophisticated attacks require more skill.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High - IDS/WAFs can detect *some* exploits, but bypasses are common. Log analysis is crucial.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement a strict patching schedule for Joomla core.
            *   Use a vulnerability scanner that specifically checks for Joomla CVEs.
            *   Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules to mitigate known Joomla vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement file integrity monitoring.

    *   **1b. Exploit Unpatched Extension Vulnerability (RCE, LFI, etc.) -> HIGH RISK -> [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a third-party Joomla extension.  This could be an RCE, Local File Inclusion (LFI), or another type of vulnerability that allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access or control.
        *   **Likelihood:** High - Extensions are often less rigorously patched than the core.
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High - Depends on the extension and vulnerability, but can lead to full compromise.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Public exploits are common for popular extensions.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium - Similar to core vulnerabilities.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High - May be harder to detect if the extension is less well-known.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Maintain a strict patching schedule for all extensions.
            *   Use only reputable extensions from trusted sources.
            *   Regularly audit installed extensions and remove unnecessary ones.
            *   Use a vulnerability scanner that checks for extension CVEs.
            *   Consider a WAF with rules to mitigate known extension vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Brute-Force/Guess Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/2__brute-forceguess_admin_credentials.md)

*   **2. Brute-Force/Guess Admin Credentials**

    *   **2a. Use Default Joomla Credentials -> HIGH RISK -> [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to log in to the Joomla administrator panel using the default username and password.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low - Most installations change default credentials, but it still happens.
        *   **Impact:** Very High - Immediate administrative access.
        *   **Effort:** Very Low - Trivial if default credentials are unchanged.
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low - No technical skill required.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Failed login attempts are usually logged.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Change default credentials *immediately* after installation.
            *   Implement account lockout policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Weak/Misconfigured Joomla Extension](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_weakmisconfigured_joomla_extension.md)

*   **3. Leverage Weak/Misconfigured Joomla Extension**

    *   **3a. Exploit Known Extension Vulnerability (CVE) -> HIGH RISK ->**
        *   **(Same as 1b - This leads into 3c(ii))**
        *   **Description:** (See 1b above)

    *   **3c. Leverage Misconfigured Extension Permissions**
        *   **3c(ii). Escalate Privileges -> HIGH RISK -> [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  The attacker exploits a misconfiguration or vulnerability within an extension to elevate their privileges within Joomla, ultimately gaining administrative access. This often involves uploading a malicious extension or exploiting a flaw in the extension's code to gain higher-level access.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Requires a specific vulnerability in the extension's code.
            *   **Impact:** Very High - Can lead to complete system compromise.
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High - Requires understanding of Joomla's extension architecture and potentially exploit development.
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High - Requires web application security expertise and potentially coding skills.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Requires careful monitoring of extension activity and potentially code analysis.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Regularly audit extension code for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
                *   Limit the ability of extensions to install other extensions or modify core Joomla files.
                *   Use the Joomla Access Control List (ACL) to restrict access to sensitive functionality.
                *   Test extensions thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying them to production.
                *   Monitor extension behavior for any attempts to bypass security controls.
