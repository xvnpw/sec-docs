# Threat Model Analysis for blueimp/jquery-file-upload

## Threat: [Client-Side Validation Bypass Leading to Server-Side Exploitation](./threats/client-side_validation_bypass_leading_to_server-side_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that bypasses `jquery-file-upload`'s client-side validation checks (e.g., `acceptFileTypes`, `maxFileSize`, `maxNumberOfFiles`).  The attacker does *not* use the library's UI; they send a crafted request directly to the server. While the *exploitation* happens server-side, the *bypass* occurs because the attacker is not constrained by the library's JavaScript.
*   **Impact:**  This enables various server-side attacks, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), and data breaches, depending on the server's vulnerabilities. The impact is determined by the *server-side* weaknesses, but the *entry point* is bypassing the client-side controls.
*   **Affected Component:**  The `jquery-file-upload` JavaScript validation logic (specifically, the options like `acceptFileTypes`, `maxFileSize`, `maxNumberOfFiles`, and any custom validation functions). These are *client-side* and therefore bypassable.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (because it facilitates server-side critical vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Rely on Client-Side Validation:** This is the most crucial mitigation.  *All* security-critical validation *must* be performed on the server. Client-side validation is for user experience only.
    *   **Server-Side Validation (Redundant):** Implement robust server-side checks for file type, size, content, and number of files, regardless of client-side settings.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data on the server, including filenames and paths.

## Threat: [Iframe Transport Exploit (If vulnerable version is used)](./threats/iframe_transport_exploit__if_vulnerable_version_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Older versions of `jquery-file-upload` (specifically those using the Iframe Transport) *could* be vulnerable to attacks if the server doesn't properly handle the response. This is less about a direct vulnerability in the *current* library and more about a historical issue that could arise if an outdated version is used *and* the server is misconfigured. The attacker could potentially manipulate the server's response within the iframe.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks, depending on the server's response handling.
*   **Affected Component:**  The `jquery-file-upload` Iframe Transport module (in older, vulnerable versions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if a vulnerable version is used and the server is misconfigured)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Latest Version:**  Keep `jquery-file-upload` updated to the latest version. This is the primary mitigation.
    *   **Proper Server Response Handling:**  Ensure the server sends the correct `Content-Type` header (e.g., `text/plain` or `application/json`) for responses from the upload endpoint, especially when using the Iframe Transport. Avoid sending HTML responses.
    *   **X-Content-Type-Options:** Set the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to prevent the browser from MIME-sniffing the response.
    * **Content Security Policy:** Use a restrictive Content Security Policy.
