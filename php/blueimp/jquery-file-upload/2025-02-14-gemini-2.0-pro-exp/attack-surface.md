# Attack Surface Analysis for blueimp/jquery-file-upload

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious File Execution (Code Injection)](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_file_execution__code_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload files containing executable code (e.g., PHP, ASP, JSP, Python scripts, or even HTML with embedded JavaScript) that the server then executes or the client renders.
*   **How `jquery-file-upload` Contributes:** The library is the *direct mechanism* for file uploads, providing the entry point for this attack. While it offers client-side file type validation (easily bypassed) and *suggests* server-side validation, the core vulnerability lies in how the *uploaded file* is handled after `jquery-file-upload` delivers it.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `malicious.php.jpg` (double extension) or `malicious.php` (claiming it's an image via `Content-Type`). If the server doesn't properly validate the file type and executes it, the attacker's code runs.  `jquery-file-upload` facilitated the upload.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Server-Side Validation:** *Never* trust the filename or `Content-Type` header. Use a whitelist of allowed extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`).  *Inspect the file contents* using a library like `libmagic` to determine the *true* file type.
    *   **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files *outside* the web root, if possible.  If within the web root, configure the server to *not* execute scripts in the upload directory.
    *   **Unique Filenames:** Generate unique filenames on the server (e.g., using UUIDs) to prevent attackers from overwriting existing files or predicting filenames.
    *   **Correct `Content-Type`:** Serve uploaded files with the correct `Content-Type` (e.g., `application/octet-stream` for unknown types) and the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Uploaded Files](./attack_surfaces/2__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_uploaded_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload HTML files (or files that can be interpreted as HTML) containing malicious JavaScript. If the application serves these files without proper sanitization or a strong `Content-Security-Policy`, the script executes in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **How `jquery-file-upload` Contributes:** The library *directly facilitates* the upload of these potentially malicious HTML files. It's the mechanism by which the attacker gets the malicious file onto the server.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads an HTML file containing `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`. If a user views this file directly through the web application (because the server didn't prevent it from being served as HTML), the script executes. `jquery-file-upload` was the upload tool.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, website defacement, phishing attacks, redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    *   **Output Encoding:** If you *must* display the contents of uploaded files, HTML-encode the output to prevent script execution.
    *   **Serve as `application/octet-stream`:** Serve all uploaded files (especially those with unknown or untrusted content) with the `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` header and the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header.
    *   **File Type Validation:**  Restrict uploads to known safe file types. Avoid allowing HTML uploads unless absolutely necessary and thoroughly validated *on the server-side*.

## Attack Surface: [3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filenames](./attack_surfaces/3__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_filenames.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload files with filenames containing malicious JavaScript. If the application displays these filenames without proper escaping, the script executes.
*   **How `jquery-file-upload` Contributes:** The library *directly handles* and processes these filenames as part of the upload.  It's the component that receives and makes the filename available to the application.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `<script>alert('XSS');</script>.jpg`. If the application displays this filename unsanitized in a list of uploaded files, the script executes. `jquery-file-upload` provided the filename to the application.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, website defacement, phishing attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding:** *Always* HTML-encode filenames (and any other user-supplied data) before displaying them in the UI.
    *   **Filename Sanitization:** Sanitize filenames on the server-side, removing or replacing potentially dangerous characters.

## Attack Surface: [4. Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/4__path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to use `../` or similar sequences in the filename to save the uploaded file outside the intended directory.
*   **How `jquery-file-upload` Contributes:** The library *directly handles* the filename provided by the user, which is then (potentially unsafely) used by the server-side code to determine the file's save location. The library is the conduit for the malicious filename.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `../../../etc/passwd`. If the server-side code (which receives the filename from `jquery-file-upload`) doesn't sanitize it, the file might overwrite a critical system file.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data loss, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Use User Input Directly:** *Never* use user-supplied input directly in file paths.
    *   **Generate Unique Filenames:** Generate unique filenames on the server (e.g., using UUIDs). This is the best defense.
    *   **Sanitize Filenames:** If you *must* use part of the original filename, sanitize it thoroughly on the server, removing or replacing dangerous characters.
    *   **Dedicated Upload Directory:** Store uploaded files in a dedicated directory, ideally outside the web root.
