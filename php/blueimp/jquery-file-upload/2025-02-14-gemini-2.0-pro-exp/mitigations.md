## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side File Type Restrictions (with Server-Side Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_file_type_restrictions__with_server-side_enforcement_.md)

1.  **`acceptFileTypes` Option:** Utilize the `acceptFileTypes` option in the `jQuery-File-Upload` initialization to provide a *first line of defense* against unwanted file types.  This option uses a regular expression to check the filename and MIME type (as reported by the *browser*). Example:
            ```javascript
            $('#fileupload').fileupload({
                acceptFileTypes: /(\.|\/)(gif|jpe?g|png)$/i
            });
            ```
2.  **Understand Limitations:**  Crucially, understand that this is *client-side* validation and is *easily bypassed*.  It provides a better user experience by preventing obvious mistakes, but it *cannot* be relied upon for security.
3.  **Inform Server-Side Validation:** The `acceptFileTypes` setting can inform, but *not replace*, your robust server-side validation (as described in previous responses).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload - High (Client-Side Only):** Provides a *weak* initial barrier, but *must* be combined with server-side validation.
    *   **Improved User Experience:** Helps prevent users from accidentally selecting the wrong file type.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:**  Reduces the *likelihood* of accidental incorrect uploads, but does *not* reduce the security risk without server-side enforcement.
    *   **User Experience:** Improves usability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The `acceptFileTypes` option is likely used in the client-side JavaScript initialization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure that the regular expression used in `acceptFileTypes` is *correct* and matches your server-side allowed file types.  It should be as restrictive as possible.
    *   Explicitly document (in code comments and developer documentation) that this is *client-side only* and *must not* be relied upon for security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side File Size Limits (with Server-Side Enforcement)](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_file_size_limits__with_server-side_enforcement_.md)

1.  **`maxFileSize` Option:** Use the `maxFileSize` option in the `jQuery-File-Upload` initialization to set a maximum file size (in bytes).  Example:
            ```javascript
            $('#fileupload').fileupload({
                maxFileSize: 10000000 // 10 MB
            });
            ```
2.  **Client-Side Check:** This provides a client-side check, preventing the upload from even starting if the file is too large.
3.  **Server-Side Enforcement:**  This is *critical*.  The `maxFileSize` option is *easily bypassed*.  You *must* also enforce file size limits on the server (as described previously).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High (Client-Side Only):**  Provides a *weak* initial barrier, but *must* be combined with server-side validation.
    *   **Improved User Experience:** Prevents users from attempting to upload very large files that would be rejected by the server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Reduces the *likelihood* of accidental large uploads, but does *not* reduce the security risk without server-side enforcement.
    *   **User Experience:** Improves usability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The `maxFileSize` option is likely used in the client-side JavaScript initialization.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure that the `maxFileSize` value is consistent with your server-side limits.
    *   Explicitly document (in code comments and developer documentation) that this is *client-side only* and *must not* be relied upon for security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSRF Token Integration](./mitigation_strategies/csrf_token_integration.md)

1.  **Obtain CSRF Token:**  Ensure your server-side framework generates a CSRF token and makes it available to your client-side code (e.g., in a hidden form field or a meta tag).
2.  **`formData` or Custom Header:**  Configure `jQuery-File-Upload` to send the CSRF token with each upload request.  You can do this in two main ways:
    *   **`formData` Option:** Add the token as a key-value pair to the `formData` option.  This is generally the preferred method.  Example:
        ```javascript
        $('#fileupload').fileupload({
            formData: { _csrf: 'YOUR_CSRF_TOKEN_HERE' }
        });
        ```
    *   **Custom Header:**  Use the `headers` option to set a custom header (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`).  Example:
        ```javascript
        $('#fileupload').fileupload({
            headers: { 'X-CSRF-Token': 'YOUR_CSRF_TOKEN_HERE' }
        });
        ```
3.  **Dynamic Token:**  Ensure the token is dynamically updated if your application uses rotating CSRF tokens. You might need to update the `formData` or `headers` before each upload if the token changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - High:**  Prevents attackers from tricking users into unknowingly uploading files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:**  Risk reduced from *High* to *Low* (when combined with proper server-side CSRF token validation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement the `formData` or `headers` option in the `jQuery-File-Upload` initialization to send the CSRF token.
    *   Ensure the server-side code correctly validates the CSRF token.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Chunked Uploads (for Large Files and Reliability)](./mitigation_strategies/chunked_uploads__for_large_files_and_reliability_.md)

1.  **`maxChunkSize` Option:**  Enable chunked uploads by setting the `maxChunkSize` option to a value smaller than `maxFileSize`.  This breaks large files into smaller pieces for upload. Example:
            ```javascript
            $('#fileupload').fileupload({
                maxChunkSize: 1000000 // 1 MB chunks
            });
            ```
2.  **Server-Side Handling:**  Your server-side code *must* be able to handle chunked uploads, reassembling the file from the individual chunks.  The `blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload` server-side examples (e.g., the PHP example) typically include support for this.
3.  **Resumability:** Chunked uploads can often be made resumable, allowing users to continue interrupted uploads.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Moderate:**  Can help mitigate DoS attacks by allowing the server to process smaller chunks of data at a time, rather than receiving a single massive upload.
    *   **Improved Reliability:**  Makes uploads more reliable, especially for large files or on unreliable network connections.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:**  Provides some mitigation, but other DoS protections (rate limiting, file size limits) are still essential.
    *   **Reliability:**  Significantly improves upload reliability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   May or may not be implemented. Check the current configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If large file uploads are supported, enable `maxChunkSize`.
    *   Ensure the server-side code correctly handles chunked uploads and reassembly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unused Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unused_features.md)

1. **Review Options:** Carefully review all the options and features provided by `jQuery-File-Upload`.
2. **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any features that your application does not need. This reduces the attack surface. For example, if you don't need image previews, disable them. If you don't need drag-and-drop functionality, disable it.
3. **Example:**
    ```javascript
    $('#fileupload').fileupload({
        // ... other options ...
        disableImagePreview: true, // Disable image previews if not needed
        disableImageResize: true,  // Disable client-side image resizing if not needed
        dropZone: null,           // Disable drag-and-drop if not needed
    });
    ```

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Various - Depends on the Feature:** Reduces the attack surface by removing potentially vulnerable code paths.

* **Impact:**
    * **Various:** Reduces risk by a small amount, depending on the specific features disabled.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Unknown. Requires a review of the current configuration.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Audit the `jQuery-File-Upload` configuration and disable any unused options.
