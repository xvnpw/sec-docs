# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, jQuery File Upload, addresses the business need for web applications to allow users to upload files. This functionality is crucial for various business processes, including:

- User profile updates: Allowing users to upload profile pictures.
- Content management systems: Enabling content creators to upload images, documents, and videos.
- Document sharing platforms: Facilitating the exchange of files between users.
- Data collection: Allowing users to submit data in file formats.

Business priorities for implementing file upload functionality typically include:

- User experience: Providing a smooth and intuitive file upload process.
- Functionality: Ensuring reliable and efficient file uploads, including features like progress bars, drag-and-drop, and file type validation.
- Scalability: Handling a large number of concurrent uploads and large file sizes.
- Security: Protecting the application and users from malicious file uploads and unauthorized access.

Most important business risks associated with file upload functionality:

- Data loss: Risk of losing uploaded files due to system failures or errors.
- Data breaches: Risk of unauthorized access to uploaded files, potentially containing sensitive information.
- Malware uploads: Risk of users uploading malicious files (viruses, malware) that could compromise the server or other users' systems.
- Denial of service: Risk of overloading the server with excessive file uploads, leading to service disruption.
- Legal and compliance risks: Risk of violating data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if uploaded files contain personal data and are not handled securely.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Client-side validation of file types and sizes (implemented in JavaScript within the jQuery File Upload plugin).
- security control: Server-side validation of file types and sizes (implementation depends on the server-side technology used with jQuery File Upload, e.g., PHP, Node.js, Python).
- security control: Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) in the web application that integrates jQuery File Upload (implementation depends on the web application framework and development practices).

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on client-side validation as a primary security measure, which can be bypassed by malicious users.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in the server-side upload handling logic if not implemented securely.
- accepted risk: Risk of misconfiguration of the server environment leading to security weaknesses.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for file names, types, and content.
- security control: Implement malware scanning of uploaded files before they are stored or processed.
- security control: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to uploaded files based on user roles and permissions.
- security control: Implement secure storage for uploaded files, including encryption at rest and in transit.
- security control: Regularly update jQuery File Upload library and server-side components to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
- security control: Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks through excessive file uploads.
- security control: Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, of the file upload functionality and related infrastructure.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
    - security requirement: The web application using jQuery File Upload must implement a secure authentication mechanism to verify user identities.
    - security requirement: File uploads should be associated with authenticated users to enable access control and auditing.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Access to uploaded files must be controlled based on user roles and permissions.
    - security requirement: Users should only be able to access files they are authorized to view or manage.
- Input validation:
    - security requirement: All file upload requests, including file names, types, sizes, and content, must be thoroughly validated on the server-side.
    - security requirement: File type validation should be based on file content (magic numbers) and not just file extensions.
    - security requirement: File names should be sanitized to prevent path traversal and other injection attacks.
    - security requirement: File size limits should be enforced to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Sensitive data within uploaded files should be encrypted at rest.
    - security requirement: Communication between the client and server during file uploads should be encrypted using HTTPS.
    - security requirement: If temporary storage is used during the upload process, it should be secured and potentially encrypted.

    style G fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write and commit code changes to the Code Repository.
2. Code Repository (GitHub): Source code is stored and version controlled in a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):  A CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically on code commits or pull requests. GitHub Actions is used as the CI/CD platform.
4. Build Environment: A dedicated build environment is set up within the CI/CD pipeline. This environment includes necessary tools and dependencies for building the application.
5. Security Checks: Automated security checks are performed in the build environment:
    - SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Scans source code for potential vulnerabilities.
    - Linter: Checks code for style and potential errors.
    - Security Scanners: May include dependency vulnerability scanning (e.g., checking for vulnerable libraries).
6. Build Artifacts: If security checks pass, the build process produces deployable artifacts, such as Docker images, zip files, or other package formats.
7. Artifact Repository: Build artifacts are stored in a secure Artifact Repository (e.g., Docker Registry, package repository) for deployment.

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Secure Code Repository: Access control to the code repository, branch protection, code review process.
- security control: Automated CI/CD Pipeline: Ensures consistent and repeatable builds, reduces manual errors.
- security control: Secure Build Environment: Hardened build environment, minimal necessary tools, isolated from production.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Identifies potential vulnerabilities in the source code early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Detects known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
- security control: Code Linting: Enforces code quality and style, reducing potential errors and security issues.
- security control: Artifact Repository Access Control: Restricts access to build artifacts to authorized personnel and deployment pipelines.
- security control: Immutable Artifacts: Build artifacts should be immutable to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.
- security control: Supply Chain Security:  Regularly audit and update build tools and dependencies to mitigate supply chain risks.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:

- Secure file upload and storage: Ensuring users can reliably and securely upload files, and that these files are stored safely and are accessible only to authorized users. Disruption or compromise of this process can lead to data loss, data breaches, and reputational damage.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- Uploaded files: Sensitivity depends on the application and user data. Files can contain:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): User documents, profile pictures, etc. (High sensitivity - requires compliance with data privacy regulations).
    - Business-critical documents: Financial reports, contracts, intellectual property (High to Medium sensitivity - potential financial and competitive impact).
    - General user-generated content: Images, videos, documents (Low to Medium sensitivity - depending on context and content).

Data sensitivity classification should be performed based on the specific application and data being handled.  Appropriate security controls should be applied based on the sensitivity level.
