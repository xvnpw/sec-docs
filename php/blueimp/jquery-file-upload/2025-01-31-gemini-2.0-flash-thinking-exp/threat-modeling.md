# Threat Model Analysis for blueimp/jquery-file-upload

## Threat: [Client-Side Validation Bypass](./threats/client-side_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can circumvent client-side validation implemented by `jquery-file-upload` (e.g., file type, size, extension checks). They can achieve this by disabling JavaScript in their browser, modifying the HTTP request using browser developer tools or intercepting proxies, or crafting requests directly without using a browser. This allows them to send files that would normally be rejected by the client-side checks.
*   **Impact:** Uploading of malicious files (malware, scripts), oversized files leading to DoS, unexpected file types causing server-side errors or vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Client-side validation functions within `jquery-file-upload` (JavaScript code).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Server-Side Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation for file type, size, extension, and content. This is the primary and most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Do not rely solely on client-side checks for security.** Client-side validation should only be for user experience, not security.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `jquery-file-upload` Library (or Dependencies)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in__jquery-file-upload__library__or_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `jquery-file-upload` library itself or its dependencies (like jQuery). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, leading to XSS attacks when users interact with the file upload functionality or related pages.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Affected Component:** `jquery-file-upload` library code or its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Libraries Updated:** Regularly update `jquery-file-upload` and all its dependencies (especially jQuery) to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reported vulnerabilities in `jquery-file-upload` and its dependencies.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities, even if they exist in the library.
