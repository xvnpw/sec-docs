# Attack Surface Analysis for blueimp/jquery-file-upload

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Client-Side Validation](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_client-side_validation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can circumvent client-side validation checks (e.g., file type, size) implemented by the library by manipulating browser requests or intercepting and modifying the upload process.

**How jquery-file-upload Contributes:** The library implements and relies on client-side validation logic, making it the direct component being bypassed. It initiates the upload based on potentially manipulated client-side information.

**Example:** A user is restricted to uploading `.jpg` files client-side. An attacker modifies the request to send a `.php` file, bypassing the client-side check initiated by `jquery-file-upload`.

**Impact:** The server receives unexpected or malicious file types/sizes, potentially leading to errors, resource exhaustion, or exploitation if server-side processing is vulnerable.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Crucially implement robust server-side validation:** Never rely solely on client-side checks provided by `jquery-file-upload`. Validate file type, size, and content on the server.
*   **Use server-side libraries for file type detection:**  Don't rely solely on the `Content-Type` header that `jquery-file-upload` transmits.
*   **Implement size limits on the server:** Enforce maximum file size limits independently of client-side settings configured within `jquery-file-upload`.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Filename Upload](./attack_surfaces/malicious_filename_upload.md)

**Description:** Attackers upload files with crafted filenames designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the server's file system or processing logic.

**How jquery-file-upload Contributes:** The library transmits the filename provided by the user to the server without inherent sanitization. This filename is a direct input handled by `jquery-file-upload`.

**Example:** An attacker uses `jquery-file-upload` to upload a file named `../../evil.php` attempting a path traversal attack to save the file outside the intended upload directory.

**Impact:** Path traversal can lead to overwriting critical files or accessing sensitive data. Malicious filenames can cause unexpected behavior or security breaches on the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Sanitize filenames on the server-side:**  The server-side component receiving the upload from `jquery-file-upload` must remove or escape potentially dangerous characters, and limit filename length.
*   **Store uploaded files with unique, generated names:** Avoid directly using the original filename transmitted by `jquery-file-upload` for storage.
*   **Implement strict path validation:** Ensure files uploaded via `jquery-file-upload` are saved only within the designated upload directory on the server.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Server-Side File Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_server-side_file_storage.md)

**Description:**  Uploaded files are stored in a location with insecure permissions or predictable paths, allowing unauthorized access or modification.

**How jquery-file-upload Contributes:** `jquery-file-upload` is the mechanism through which the file is transferred to the server. While the storage decision is server-side, the library's functionality is essential for this attack surface to be relevant.

**Example:** Files uploaded via `jquery-file-upload` are stored in a publicly accessible directory on the web server, allowing anyone to download them.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential data breaches, manipulation or deletion of uploaded files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Store uploaded files received from `jquery-file-upload` outside the web server's document root.**
*   **Implement strict access controls on the upload directory:** Ensure only authorized users/processes can access the files uploaded via `jquery-file-upload`.
*   **Use unique, non-predictable filenames for storage:**  The server-side handling of files uploaded by `jquery-file-upload` should implement this.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Vulnerabilities in File Processing](./attack_surfaces/server-side_vulnerabilities_in_file_processing.md)

**Description:** The server-side code that processes uploaded files (e.g., image resizing, virus scanning) contains vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

**How jquery-file-upload Contributes:** `jquery-file-upload` is the tool that delivers the file to the server, making it available for potentially vulnerable processing. The library's role is the initial transfer that enables this attack surface.

**Example:** A vulnerable image processing library is used to resize an image uploaded via `jquery-file-upload`, and an attacker uploads a specially crafted image that triggers a buffer overflow in the library.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use secure and up-to-date libraries for processing files uploaded via `jquery-file-upload`.**
*   **Implement proper input validation and sanitization on the server before processing files uploaded by `jquery-file-upload`.**
*   **Run file processing tasks for files uploaded via `jquery-file-upload` in isolated environments (sandboxes) to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.**
