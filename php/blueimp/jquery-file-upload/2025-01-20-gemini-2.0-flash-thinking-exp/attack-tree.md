                * Command Injection via Filename (if used in server-side commands) **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Insufficient Content Security Checks

## Attack Tree Path: [Attack: Compromise Application via jQuery File Upload (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/attack_compromise_application_via_jquery_file_upload__critical_node_.md)

This represents the successful achievement of the attacker's goal, resulting in a significant security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND: Bypass Client-Side Validation (HIGH RISK PATH - Initial Step)](./attack_tree_paths/and_bypass_client-side_validation__high_risk_path_-_initial_step_.md)

This involves circumventing the client-side checks implemented by jQuery File Upload for file type and size.
    * **Modify Request to Alter File Type (e.g., change Content-Type header):** Attackers can use browser developer tools or intercepting proxies to change the `Content-Type` header in the HTTP request, making a malicious file appear as a legitimate one.
    * **Modify Request to Alter File Size Information:** Similar to file type, attackers can manipulate the request to report a smaller file size than the actual uploaded file.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND: Manipulate Upload Options (HIGH RISK PATH - If Server-Side Vulnerable)](./attack_tree_paths/and_manipulate_upload_options__high_risk_path_-_if_server-side_vulnerable_.md)

This involves exploiting vulnerabilities arising from the server-side's improper handling of upload options, particularly the filename.
    * **Inject Malicious Filename (HIGH RISK PATH - If Server-Side Vulnerable):** Attackers craft filenames to exploit vulnerabilities.
        * **Path Traversal: Upload file to unintended location (e.g., "../../../sensitive_data.txt") (CRITICAL NODE if successful):** By including path traversal sequences in the filename, attackers can attempt to place uploaded files in directories outside the intended upload directory, potentially accessing or overwriting sensitive files.
        * **Overwrite Existing Files: Upload file with the name of a critical system file (CRITICAL NODE if successful):** Attackers can upload a malicious file with the same name as a critical system file, potentially replacing the legitimate file and compromising the application's functionality or security.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND: Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Related to Uploaded Files (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/and_exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_related_to_uploaded_files__high_risk_path_.md)

This encompasses vulnerabilities in how the server processes and handles uploaded files.
    * **AND: Upload Malicious File for Execution (HIGH RISK PATH - Leads to Critical Node):** The attacker's goal is to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        * **Upload Web Shell (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers upload scripts (e.g., PHP, Python) that provide a backdoor, allowing them to execute commands remotely. This often involves bypassing server-side file type checks.
        * **Upload Exploit Payload (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers upload files specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in server-side processing libraries used to handle the uploaded files (e.g., image processing libraries).
    * **AND: Exploit Insecure File Handling (HIGH RISK PATH):** This focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the server manages uploaded files after receiving them.
        * **Insecure Storage Location:**
            * **Direct Access to Uploaded Files (e.g., predictable URLs) (CRITICAL NODE if sensitive data exposed):** If uploaded files are stored in publicly accessible directories without proper access controls, attackers can directly access them, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing the execution of uploaded web shells.
        * **Insufficient Sanitization of Filename:**
            * **Command Injection via Filename (if used in server-side commands) (CRITICAL NODE):** If the server uses the uploaded filename in commands without proper sanitization, it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
        * **Insufficient Content Security Checks:**
            * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Uploaded Files (e.g., specially crafted documents) (CRITICAL NODE if internal resources accessed):** Specially crafted documents (e.g., XML files with external entity references) can be uploaded to trigger SSRF vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to make requests on behalf of the server, potentially accessing internal resources.
