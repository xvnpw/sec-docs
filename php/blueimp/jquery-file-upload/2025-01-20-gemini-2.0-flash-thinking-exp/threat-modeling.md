# Threat Model Analysis for blueimp/jquery-file-upload

## Threat: [Client-Side File Type Spoofing](./threats/client-side_file_type_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the file's MIME type in the browser (e.g., using developer tools) before the `jquery-file-upload` library initiates the upload. This can bypass client-side validation implemented within the library that relies solely on the browser-reported MIME type.
*   **Impact:** Allows the upload of files that would otherwise be blocked by the library's client-side checks, potentially leading to server-side vulnerabilities if server-side validation is insufficient.
*   **Affected Component:** Client-side validation logic within `jquery-file-upload`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Do not rely solely on client-side validation within `jquery-file-upload` for security.**
    *   Implement robust server-side file type validation based on MIME type and "magic numbers" (file signatures), not just the file extension.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Filenames](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_filenames.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a file with a malicious filename containing JavaScript code. If the application using `jquery-file-upload` later displays this filename without proper encoding, the JavaScript code could be executed in the user's browser. The library itself might not be directly executing the script, but it facilitates the upload of the malicious filename.
*   **Impact:** Stealing user cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:** Client-side handling and display of uploaded filenames by the application using `jquery-file-upload`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement proper output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) when displaying uploaded filenames retrieved or managed by the application using `jquery-file-upload`.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (jQuery)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__jquery_.md)

**Description:** The `jquery-file-upload` library relies on jQuery. If the specific version of jQuery included or used by the application has known vulnerabilities, these could be exploited.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the jQuery vulnerability, this could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), DOM manipulation, or other client-side attacks within the context of the application using `jquery-file-upload`.
*   **Affected Component:** The included jQuery library used by `jquery-file-upload`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific jQuery vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the jQuery library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly review security advisories for jQuery and update accordingly.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Error Messages](./threats/information_disclosure_via_error_messages.md)

**Description:** Error messages generated by the `jquery-file-upload` library itself (e.g., during file selection or upload failures) might inadvertently reveal sensitive information about the client-side environment or configuration.
*   **Impact:** Providing attackers with potentially useful information about the application's client-side setup, which could aid in further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Error handling logic within `jquery-file-upload`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and customize error messages generated by `jquery-file-upload` to avoid exposing sensitive details.
    *   Implement generic error messages for user display and log detailed errors securely on the server-side for debugging.
