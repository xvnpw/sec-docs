# Threat Model Analysis for blueimp/jquery-file-upload

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Filename](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_filename.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a file with a crafted filename containing malicious JavaScript code. The `jquery-file-upload` library, when displaying this filename (e.g., in the UI elements it manages for displaying upload progress or completed files) without proper sanitization, allows the attacker's script to execute in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.

**Affected Component:** Client-side JavaScript rendering within the `jquery-file-upload` library's UI components or callbacks used to display file information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) when displaying any user-provided data, including filenames, handled or displayed by the `jquery-file-upload` library.
*   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Threat: [Reliance on Client-Side Validation for Security](./threats/reliance_on_client-side_validation_for_security.md)

**Description:** An attacker bypasses the client-side validation mechanisms provided by the `jquery-file-upload` library (e.g., file type restrictions, size limits) by manipulating the HTTP request directly or disabling JavaScript. If the server-side does not perform its own independent and robust validation, the attacker can successfully upload malicious or oversized files through the library's upload mechanism.

**Impact:** Introduction of malware onto the server, storage of inappropriate content, potential for server-side vulnerabilities exploitation due to unexpected file types or sizes, denial of service (via large file uploads).

**Affected Component:** Client-side validation functions and configuration options within the `jquery-file-upload` library (e.g., `acceptFileTypes`, `maxFileSize`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Never rely solely on client-side validation provided by `jquery-file-upload` for security.** Implement comprehensive server-side validation for file type, size, content, and any other relevant criteria.
*   Use allow-lists instead of deny-lists for acceptable file types on the server-side.
*   Ensure server-side validation occurs *after* the file is received by the server, not just based on client-provided information.
