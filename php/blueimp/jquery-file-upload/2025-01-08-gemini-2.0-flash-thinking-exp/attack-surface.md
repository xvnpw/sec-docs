# Attack Surface Analysis for blueimp/jquery-file-upload

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal/Directory Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversaldirectory_traversal.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the filename or path information *provided through the `jquery-file-upload` interface* during the upload process to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system.

**How jquery-file-upload Contributes:** If the server-side code directly uses the filename provided by the `jquery-file-upload` library without sanitization, attackers can include path traversal characters (e.g., `../`, `C:\`) in the filename *submitted through the upload form*.

**Example:** An attacker uses the file input field to select a file named `../../../../etc/passwd`. If the server-side doesn't sanitize the filename received from the `jquery-file-upload` submission, it might attempt to write to this location.

**Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, placing malicious scripts in accessible locations, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Sanitize filenames on the server-side *immediately after receiving the upload from `jquery-file-upload`***: Remove or replace any path traversal characters.
* **Use a predefined upload directory on the server-side:**  Do not allow user-provided paths from the `jquery-file-upload` submission to influence the storage location.
* **Generate unique filenames on the server-side:** Avoid using the original filename received from `jquery-file-upload` for storage.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Filename/Metadata](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_filenamemetadata.md)

**Description:** If the application displays filenames or metadata *obtained from the `jquery-file-upload` process* without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.

**How jquery-file-upload Contributes:** The library provides the filename and potentially other metadata to the server. If this data, *originating from the user's interaction with the `jquery-file-upload` input*, is then displayed to other users without escaping, it can lead to XSS.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `<script>alert("XSS")</script>evil.jpg` using the `jquery-file-upload` interface. When this filename, retrieved from the upload data, is displayed on the website, the script will execute in the victim's browser.

**Impact:** Account hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, information theft, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Sanitize or escape user-provided data *received from `jquery-file-upload`***: Encode filenames and metadata before displaying them in HTML contexts. Use appropriate encoding functions for the specific context (e.g., HTML escaping).
* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Helps to mitigate XSS attacks by defining trusted sources of content.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Large File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_large_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses the `jquery-file-upload` interface to upload excessively large files to exhaust server resources (bandwidth, disk space, processing power), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**How jquery-file-upload Contributes:** The library provides the client-side functionality to select and initiate the upload of files, including potentially very large ones.

**Example:** An attacker uses the file input provided by `jquery-file-upload` to select and upload a multi-gigabyte file, filling up the server's disk space and making it unresponsive.

**Impact:** Website unavailability, service disruption, increased infrastructure costs.

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement server-side file size limits:** Restrict the maximum allowed size for uploaded files *on the server-side, regardless of client-side checks*.
* **Implement rate limiting:** Limit the number of file uploads from a single IP address within a specific timeframe.
* **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Can help distribute the load and mitigate bandwidth exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_excessive_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses the `jquery-file-upload` interface to send a large number of small file upload requests simultaneously to overwhelm the server's processing capacity.

**How jquery-file-upload Contributes:** The library makes it easy for users (including malicious ones) to initiate multiple file uploads, potentially in rapid succession.

**Example:** An attacker uses a script in conjunction with the `jquery-file-upload` form to rapidly send hundreds of small file upload requests, overloading the server's processing queue.

**Impact:** Website unavailability, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement rate limiting:** Limit the number of file uploads from a single IP address within a specific timeframe.
* **Use CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms:**  To prevent automated bots from sending excessive requests through the `jquery-file-upload` form.
* **Optimize server-side processing:** Ensure efficient handling of file uploads.
