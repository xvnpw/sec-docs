## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Introduced by File Upload](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_file_upload.md)

This path represents the most direct and likely way an attacker can achieve the goal of executing arbitrary code. It involves a sequence of actions targeting weaknesses in how the server handles uploaded files.

**Attack Vectors within this Path:**

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Upload Malicious File:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker uploads a file containing malicious code. This is the initial step to introduce a threat onto the server.
    *   **Focus:** The content of the uploaded file is the primary concern here.
    *   **Example:** Uploading a PHP file containing a web shell function.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Upload Web Shell (e.g., PHP, JSP, ASPX):**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A specific type of malicious file upload where the file is designed to provide remote command execution capabilities on the server.
    *   **Focus:**  The functionality of the uploaded file to allow remote control.
    *   **Example:**  A simple PHP script with a `system()` or `exec()` function controlled via a GET or POST parameter.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Server-Side File Type Restrictions:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker circumvents the server's attempts to block certain file types. This allows the upload of malicious files that would otherwise be rejected.
    *   **Focus:** Techniques used to make a malicious file appear legitimate to the server's checks.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: MIME Type Spoofing:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the MIME type of the uploaded file in the HTTP request to trick the server into thinking it's a safe file type.
    *   **Focus:** Altering the `Content-Type` header in the upload request.
    *   **Example:** Uploading a PHP file but setting the `Content-Type` to `image/jpeg`.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Insecure File Storage Location:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The server stores the uploaded file in a location where it can be directly accessed and executed by web users.
    *   **Focus:** The directory where the file is saved and the permissions on that directory.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Upload File to Publicly Accessible Directory:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** A specific instance of insecure storage where the uploaded file is placed within the web server's document root or another directory that is directly accessible via a web browser.
    *   **Focus:**  The file path and accessibility via HTTP/HTTPS.
    *   **Example:**  Saving the uploaded `webshell.php` file directly in the `public_html` or `www` directory.
