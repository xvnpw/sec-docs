## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using librespeed/speedtest [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_librespeedspeedtest__critical_node_.md)

*   This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this could involve exploiting any of the vulnerabilities listed below, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or disruption of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Speed Test Results to Influence Application Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_speed_test_results_to_influence_application_logic__critical_node_.md)

*   This critical node focuses on subverting the application's logic by providing it with falsified speed test data.
    *   **Intercept and Modify Results in Transit [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker positions themselves between the client and the server (Man-in-the-Middle attack). If the communication channel is not properly secured with HTTPS, the attacker can intercept the speed test results being transmitted.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Once intercepted, the attacker modifies the results (e.g., artificially inflating download speed, reducing upload speed) before forwarding them to the application.
        *   **Impact:** The application, relying on these tampered results, may make incorrect decisions or perform unintended actions.
    *   **Tamper with Server-Side Speed Test Logic [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   This involves directly manipulating the code or data on the server responsible for running the speed test and generating results.
            *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Customizations or Extensions [HIGH RISK]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the application has customized the `librespeed/speedtest` implementation or added extensions, vulnerabilities in this custom code can be exploited.
                *   **Attack Vector:**  **Code Injection through insecure handling of configuration or plugins [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers might inject malicious code through poorly sanitized configuration parameters or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how plugins are handled. This could allow them to alter the speed test logic or even gain remote code execution on the server.
                *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to arbitrarily modify how speed tests are conducted and reported.
            *   **Directly Modify Speed Test Data Sources or Databases [HIGH RISK]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the speed test results are stored in a database or other data source, attackers might attempt to directly modify this data.
                *   **Attack Vector:** **SQL Injection or other data manipulation vulnerabilities in backend data storage [HIGH RISK]:**  Exploiting SQL injection flaws in the database interaction logic allows attackers to insert, delete, or modify speed test data directly.
                *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject false data, delete legitimate results, or manipulate historical data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies or Underlying Technologies of librespeed [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_or_underlying_technologies_of_librespeed__critical_node_.md)

*   This critical node focuses on vulnerabilities in the software and infrastructure that `librespeed/speedtest` relies on.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in the Web Server Hosting librespeed [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) hosting the speed test application might have known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Attack Vector:** **Exploit known vulnerabilities in Apache, Nginx, etc. [HIGH RISK]:** Attackers can leverage publicly known exploits for these web servers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
        *   **Impact:** Could lead to full compromise of the server hosting the speed test and potentially other applications on the same server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in the Deployment of librespeed within the Application [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_the_deployment_of_librespeed_within_the_application__critical_node___hi_19c32073.md)

*   This critical node highlights risks arising from improper setup and configuration of the speed test application.
    *   **Insecure Permissions on Speed Test Files or Directories [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Incorrect file system permissions might allow unauthorized users or processes to read sensitive configuration files, modify the speed test code, or even execute arbitrary commands.
        *   **Impact:** Could expose sensitive information or allow attackers to tamper with the speed test application.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Speed Test Configuration [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Configuration files might contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or internal network details. If these files are publicly accessible or have weak access controls, attackers can retrieve this information.
        *   **Impact:** Exposed credentials can be used to access other systems or data. Exposed network details can aid in further attacks.
    *   **Using Outdated or Vulnerable Version of librespeed [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Using an outdated version of `librespeed/speedtest` means the application is vulnerable to any security flaws that have been discovered and patched in newer versions.
        *   **Impact:** Attackers can leverage known exploits for these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
