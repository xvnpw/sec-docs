# Threat Model Analysis for librespeed/speedtest

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Client-Side Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_client-side_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via Client-Side Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability within the `librespeed/speedtest` JavaScript code (e.g., a bug in how it handles specific network responses or data parsing). They craft a malicious network response or input that, when processed by the vulnerable code, allows them to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's browser session within the context of the application. This could lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, performing actions on behalf of the user, or injecting further malware.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `librespeed/speedtest` core modules responsible for data processing and UI rendering (e.g., modules handling server responses, graph drawing, or result display).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `librespeed/speedtest` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure the integrity of the `librespeed/speedtest` files served to the client.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Output within `librespeed/speedtest`](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_output_within__librespeedspeedtest_.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Output within `librespeed/speedtest`
    *   **Description:** The `librespeed/speedtest` library itself might render data (e.g., server names, error messages) without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the speed test process or server responses to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then directly rendered by the library, executing in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malicious code injection, leading to session hijacking, redirection, defacement, or information theft within the application's context.
    *   **Affected Component:** `librespeed/speedtest` modules responsible for rendering UI elements and displaying data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `librespeed/speedtest` library updated to versions with proper output sanitization.
        *   If modifying the library, ensure all data rendering logic includes robust output encoding.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `librespeed/speedtest` Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__librespeedspeedtest__dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `librespeed/speedtest` Dependencies
    *   **Description:** The `librespeed/speedtest` library relies on other JavaScript libraries or dependencies. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them through the context of the `librespeed/speedtest` library running in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to client-side code execution, XSS, or other security issues.
    *   **Affected Component:** Third-party libraries and dependencies used by `librespeed/speedtest`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit the dependencies used by `librespeed/speedtest`.
        *   Utilize tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
