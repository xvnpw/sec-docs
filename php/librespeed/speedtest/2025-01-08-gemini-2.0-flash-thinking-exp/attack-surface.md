# Attack Surface Analysis for librespeed/speedtest

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration or Results](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_configuration_or_results.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into the web application, which are then executed in the browsers of other users.
    *   **How Speedtest Contributes:** If the application renders speed test configuration parameters or results *directly* from `librespeed/speedtest` without proper sanitization, attacker-controlled data can be interpreted as code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a URL parameter controlling the displayed server name *as reported by the speed test* in the results to include `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views the results, the script executes.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict output encoding/escaping of all data displayed *originating from the speed test library*. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript strings).
        *   **Developer:**  Avoid directly embedding user-provided data into the speed test configuration *that is then reflected without sanitization*.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `librespeed/speedtest` Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__librespeedspeedtest__dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the third-party libraries used by `librespeed/speedtest`.
    *   **How Speedtest Contributes:**  The application inherits the risk of any vulnerabilities present in the libraries `librespeed/speedtest` relies upon.
    *   **Example:**  A known security flaw exists in a specific version of a charting library *used by `librespeed/speedtest`*.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability; could range from XSS to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Regularly update `librespeed/speedtest` to the latest version to benefit from security patches in its dependencies.
        *   **Developer:**  Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion on the Server Hosting Test Files](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_on_the_server_hosting_test_files.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker overwhelms the server hosting the speed test files with excessive requests.
    *   **How Speedtest Contributes:** The core functionality of `librespeed/speedtest` involves downloading and uploading files, which can be resource-intensive, making the server a target for DoS attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker initiates a large number of concurrent speed tests *using the application's speed test feature*, exceeding the server's capacity to handle the requests.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the speed test functionality unavailable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement rate limiting on the server-side to restrict the number of speed tests from a single IP address or user within a given timeframe.
        *   **Developer:**  Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute the load of serving test files.
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust server infrastructure with sufficient resources to handle expected load and potential spikes.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Serving](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_file_serving.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths to access files outside of the intended directory.
    *   **How Speedtest Contributes:** If the application implements a custom server-side component to serve test files *for `librespeed/speedtest`* and doesn't properly sanitize file paths, attackers can exploit this.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a request like `GET /download?file=../../../../etc/passwd` *targeting the server component serving files for the speed test*.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential access to sensitive server data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Avoid implementing custom file serving logic if possible. Utilize secure, well-tested web server configurations.
        *   **Developer:** If custom logic is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization of file paths. Use whitelisting of allowed directories and filenames.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files to the server.
    *   **How Speedtest Contributes:** If the upload functionality *used by `librespeed/speedtest`* is enabled and lacks proper validation, attackers can upload arbitrary files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image *through the speed test's upload mechanism* to gain remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** If upload functionality is not strictly necessary *for the speed test*, disable it.
        *   **Developer:** Implement comprehensive server-side validation of uploaded files, including file type, size, and content. Use techniques like magic number verification and avoid relying solely on file extensions.
        *   **Developer:** Store uploaded files in a secure location outside the webroot and with restricted execution permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/server-side_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code that is executed on the server.
    *   **How Speedtest Contributes:** If the application dynamically generates server-side speed test configurations *for `librespeed/speedtest`* based on user input without sanitization, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates an input field that is used to construct a command executed on the server *when processing speed test configuration*, injecting malicious commands.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Avoid dynamically generating server-side configurations based on user input if possible.
        *   **Developer:** If dynamic generation is necessary, implement strict input validation and output encoding to prevent the injection of malicious code. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
