# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for librespeed/speedtest

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Rate Limiting (Speedtest-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_rate_limiting__speedtest-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Key Metrics:** Determine appropriate rate-limiting metrics specific to speed test abuse.  These should include IP address, and potentially session IDs (if user authentication is used). Geolocation is an option, but consider privacy implications.
    2.  **Define Limits:** Establish clear limits, tailored to speed test frequency.  Example:
        *   IP Address:  Maximum 5 tests per hour, burst allowance of 2 tests within 1 minute.
        *   Session ID: Maximum 10 tests per session.
    3.  **Implement Rate Limiting Logic:** Use a suitable mechanism (Redis, database, middleware) to track and enforce. Prioritize server-side enforcement.
    4.  **Graceful Degradation:** Instead of hard blocking, use HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests), `Retry-After` header, informative messages, and potentially reduce test size/duration for subsequent attempts.
    5.  **Dynamic Adjustment (Optional):** Monitor server load (CPU, network) and adjust rate limits programmatically.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents overwhelming the server with speed test requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Limits CPU, memory, and bandwidth consumption specific to speed test operations.
    *   **Abuse of Functionality (Bandwidth Costs) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces excessive bandwidth usage from speed tests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces successful DoS attack risk.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Greatly reduces server overload from excessive speed tests.
    *   **Abuse of Functionality:** Moderately reduces excessive bandwidth consumption.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** The `librespeed` backend (PHP example) *lacks* built-in rate limiting.  Example HTML files *suggest* Cloudflare (external), but it's not inherent. IP logging (a prerequisite) is mentioned, but not rate limiting itself.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Backend Logic:** The core `librespeed` backend (e.g., `example-php/backend/empty.php`) *needs* explicit rate-limiting logic. This is the *critical* missing piece.
    *   **Configuration Options:** The project could benefit from configuration options for easy rate limiting customization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Test Duration and Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/test_duration_and_size_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Existing Parameters:** Examine `librespeed`'s parameters (e.g., `xhr_dl_blob_size`, `xhr_ul_blob_size`, `time_ul_max`, `time_dl_max`) in the example HTML files.
    2.  **Set Reasonable Maximums:** Based on server capacity and expected usage, set *strict* maximums for these parameters. Be conservative. Example:
        *   `time_ul_max`: 15 seconds.
        *   `time_dl_max`: 15 seconds.
        *   `xhr_dl_blob_size` and `xhr_ul_blob_size`: Calculate based on target bandwidth and duration.
    3.  **Enforce Limits Server-Side:** *Crucially*, enforce limits on the server (e.g., PHP backend), *not just* client-side. The server should:
        *   Validate requested parameters against maximums.
        *   Terminate tests exceeding time limits.
        *   Reject requests for excessively large data.
    4.  **Consider Tiered Testing (Optional):** Offer different test sizes/durations based on authentication (e.g., shorter tests for unauthenticated users).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents long/large tests from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Limits resource consumption per test.
    *   **Abuse of Functionality (Bandwidth Costs) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces bandwidth usage by limiting test size/duration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces DoS risk from long/large tests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Greatly reduces overload from individual tests.
    *   **Abuse of Functionality:** Moderately reduces excessive bandwidth.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** Example HTML files *have* configurable parameters.  However, server-side enforcement is *weak or missing*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Server-Side Enforcement:** The backend (e.g., `example-php/backend/empty.php`) *must* actively validate parameters and terminate tests exceeding limits. This is the *critical* missing piece. The current backend focuses on data transfer, not strong limit enforcement.
    *   **Clear Error Handling:**  Return informative errors if limits are exceeded.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client IP Address Handling (Privacy-Focused, Speedtest Context)](./mitigation_strategies/client_ip_address_handling__privacy-focused__speedtest_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Necessity:** Determine if logging client IPs is *essential* for your speed test's purpose. Consider privacy laws (GDPR).
    2.  **Disable Logging (If Possible):** If not required, disable it in the `librespeed` backend. The PHP example has `$enable_logging`; set it to `false`.
    3.  **If Logging is Required:**
        *   **Minimize Retention:** Store IPs for the *shortest* time needed (abuse detection, troubleshooting).
        *   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** After retention, anonymize (irreversibly remove) or pseudonymize (replace with an unlinkable ID).
        *   **Access Control:** Strict access to IP logs; authorized personnel only.
        *   **Encryption:** Consider encrypting logs at rest.
        *   **Transparency:** Clearly state in your privacy policy how IPs are handled.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Privacy) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces exposure of user IPs (PII).
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High, jurisdiction-dependent):** Helps with GDPR, CCPA, etc.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces privacy risks related to IP collection.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Reduces legal/financial penalties for non-compliance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially.** The PHP backend example *has* `$enable_logging` to disable logging.  However, it *lacks* anonymization, pseudonymization, or automated retention.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** The backend needs built-in mechanisms for these.
    *   **Data Retention Policy:** The project lacks tools/guidance for IP log retention.
    *   **Documentation:**  The documentation should emphasize privacy implications and best practices.
