# Deep Analysis: DoS/DDoS Amplification Attack Surface - LibreSpeed Speedtest

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the DoS/DDoS amplification attack surface of the LibreSpeed speedtest application.  This includes understanding how the application's core functionality can be abused, identifying specific vulnerabilities, and proposing concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level suggestions.  The goal is to provide the development team with a prioritized list of improvements to significantly reduce the risk of the application being used in amplification attacks.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the DoS/DDoS amplification attack vector.  It covers:

*   The inherent amplification potential of speed testing.
*   Specific features and configurations of LibreSpeed that exacerbate this potential.
*   Network-level and application-level mitigation techniques.
*   Monitoring and alerting strategies to detect and respond to amplification attempts.
*   Code-level considerations where applicable.

This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors (e.g., XSS, SQL injection) except where they might indirectly contribute to amplification.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Review of Existing Documentation and Code:** Examine the LibreSpeed GitHub repository, documentation, and source code to understand the application's architecture, features, and existing security measures.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific attack scenarios and how they could leverage LibreSpeed's functionality.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Pinpoint specific weaknesses in the application's design or implementation that could be exploited for amplification.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Develop detailed, practical mitigation strategies, prioritizing those with the highest impact and feasibility.
5.  **Recommendation Prioritization:**  Rank recommendations based on their effectiveness, ease of implementation, and impact on legitimate users.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Inherent Amplification Potential

The core function of a speed test – measuring upload and download speeds – inherently involves transferring significant amounts of data.  This creates an amplification vector: a small request can trigger a large response.  The amplification factor is the ratio of the response size to the request size.  In a speed test, this factor can be very high, especially for upload tests.

### 2.2. LibreSpeed-Specific Considerations

*   **Upload Test Size:** The size of the data sent during the upload test is a critical factor.  Larger upload sizes lead to greater amplification potential.  LibreSpeed likely has configurable parameters for this, which need to be carefully managed.
*   **Number of Test Streams:**  Multiple simultaneous streams (if supported) can further increase the amplification factor.  Attackers could potentially initiate multiple tests concurrently.
*   **Lack of Authentication:**  By default, LibreSpeed does not require authentication.  This makes it trivial for attackers to initiate tests.
*   **IP Address Handling:**  The application must correctly handle the source IP address of incoming requests.  If it doesn't properly validate or log this information, it becomes difficult to track down attackers or implement IP-based blocking.
*   **WebSocket Usage:** LibreSpeed uses WebSockets for real-time communication.  While WebSockets themselves aren't inherently vulnerable, the way they are used in LibreSpeed needs to be examined.  Are there any mechanisms to limit the number of WebSocket connections per IP?  Are there timeouts for idle connections?
*   **HTTP Headers:** Are any custom HTTP headers used that could be abused or manipulated by attackers?
*   **Error Handling:** How does the application handle errors?  Do error responses contribute to amplification?  Are error messages verbose and potentially leak information?

### 2.3. Threat Modeling Scenarios

1.  **Single Large Upload Test:** An attacker sends a single request, spoofing the victim's IP address, triggering a large upload test.  The server sends a large amount of data to the victim.
2.  **Multiple Concurrent Tests:** An attacker initiates multiple speed tests simultaneously, all spoofing the victim's IP address, multiplying the amplification effect.
3.  **Slowloris-Type Attack (Modified):** While Slowloris typically targets connection exhaustion, a modified version could involve initiating a speed test and then *intentionally* slowing down the data transfer, tying up server resources and potentially amplifying the response over a longer period.
4.  **Botnet-Driven Amplification:** A botnet, with each bot sending a small request, can generate a massive flood of data directed at the victim.

### 2.4. Vulnerability Analysis

Based on the above, the following are potential vulnerabilities:

*   **Vulnerability 1: Unrestricted Upload Test Size:**  If the upload test size is not limited or is configurable to excessively large values, it directly increases the amplification factor.
*   **Vulnerability 2: Lack of Rate Limiting (or Ineffective Rate Limiting):**  Insufficient or poorly configured rate limiting allows attackers to initiate numerous tests in a short period.
*   **Vulnerability 3: No Connection Limits:**  The absence of limits on the number of concurrent WebSocket connections per IP allows attackers to consume server resources and potentially amplify attacks.
*   **Vulnerability 4: Insufficient IP Address Validation/Logging:**  If the application doesn't properly validate or log the source IP address, it hinders mitigation efforts.
*   **Vulnerability 5: Predictable Test Behavior:** If the test parameters (e.g., data size, timing) are easily predictable, attackers can optimize their attacks for maximum amplification.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies (Refined)

The following mitigation strategies are prioritized and expanded upon the initial list:

1.  **Strict, Configurable Rate Limiting (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Implementation:** Implement a multi-layered rate limiting system:
        *   **Tests per IP per Time Period:** Limit the number of speed tests allowed from a single IP address within a defined time window (e.g., 1 test per minute).
        *   **Bandwidth per IP per Time Period:** Limit the total bandwidth consumed by a single IP address within a time window (e.g., 100 MB per hour).
        *   **Concurrent Connections per IP:** Limit the number of simultaneous WebSocket connections from a single IP.
        *   **Global Rate Limits:**  Implement overall limits on the total number of tests and bandwidth consumed across all users.
    *   **Configuration:**  Provide administrators with granular control over these limits through a configuration file or web interface.  Allow different limits for upload and download tests.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Consider implementing adaptive rate limiting that automatically adjusts limits based on current server load and attack patterns.
    *   **Code Example (Conceptual - using a hypothetical rate limiting library):**

        ```python
        from ratelimit import limits, RateLimitException
        from backoff import on_exception, expo

        FIVE_MINUTES = 300

        @on_exception(expo, RateLimitException, max_tries=8)
        @limits(calls=1, period=FIVE_MINUTES)
        def run_speedtest(ip_address):
            # ... speed test logic ...
        ```

2.  **IP Reputation and Blocking (High Priority):**
    *   **Integration:** Integrate with IP reputation services (e.g., Project Honeypot, Spamhaus, commercial providers) to automatically block or limit requests from known malicious IPs.
    *   **Local Blacklist/Whitelist:**  Allow administrators to maintain local blacklists and whitelists of IP addresses.
    *   **Dynamic Blocking:**  Automatically block IPs that exceed rate limits or exhibit suspicious behavior.

3.  **CAPTCHA/Challenge-Response (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Conditional CAPTCHA:**  Implement a CAPTCHA (e.g., reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha) that is triggered only when certain conditions are met:
        *   Rate limits are exceeded.
        *   The request originates from a suspicious IP address (based on reputation).
        *   A configurable threshold for test size or bandwidth is reached.
    *   **Configuration:**  Allow administrators to enable/disable the CAPTCHA and configure the triggering conditions.

4.  **Traffic Shaping/Filtering (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Network-Level Implementation:**  Use network devices (firewalls, routers) to prioritize legitimate traffic and drop traffic that matches known attack patterns (e.g., large UDP packets with spoofed source IPs).
    *   **Quality of Service (QoS):**  Configure QoS settings to prioritize legitimate speed test traffic over potentially malicious traffic.

5.  **Monitoring and Alerting (High Priority):**
    *   **Real-time Monitoring:**  Monitor key metrics in real-time:
        *   Number of speed tests per second.
        *   Bandwidth usage per IP address.
        *   Number of concurrent connections.
        *   Number of failed tests.
        *   Number of CAPTCHA challenges issued/passed/failed.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts to be triggered when these metrics exceed predefined thresholds.  Alerts should be sent to administrators via email, SMS, or other notification channels.
    *   **Logging:**  Log all relevant events, including IP addresses, timestamps, test parameters, and any errors or warnings.  Ensure logs are securely stored and regularly reviewed.

6.  **Disable Unnecessary Features (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Configuration Options:**  Provide options to disable upload tests, ping tests, or other features that are not essential.  This reduces the attack surface.

7.  **Geolocation Restrictions (Low Priority):**
    *   **IP Geolocation:**  Use IP geolocation databases to restrict access to the speed test server to specific geographic regions.  This can be useful if the service is intended for a limited audience.

8. **Introduce Randomness (Medium Priority):**
    * **Test Data Randomization:** Instead of sending predictable data patterns, introduce randomness into the test data. This makes it harder for attackers to optimize their attacks.
    * **Slight Delays:** Introduce small, random delays in the test process. This can disrupt the timing of amplification attacks.

9. **WebSocket Connection Management (High Priority):**
    * **Connection Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the number of concurrent WebSocket connections per IP address.
    * **Idle Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for idle WebSocket connections to prevent resource exhaustion.
    * **Connection Validation:** Validate WebSocket connections to ensure they are legitimate and not part of an attack.

10. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (High Priority):**
    * **Schedule:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address any new vulnerabilities.
    * **Third-Party Review:** Consider engaging a third-party security firm to perform independent assessments.
