# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for librespeed/speedtest

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Librespeed Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_librespeed_library.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Librespeed Library
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Monitor the `librespeed/speedtest` GitHub repository for new releases and security advisories.
    *   Step 2: Subscribe to release notifications or use dependency management tools to track updates for `librespeed/speedtest`.
    *   Step 3: When a new version of Librespeed is released, review the changelog and release notes for security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Step 4: Download the latest Librespeed library files (JavaScript, CSS, etc.) from the official repository or release page.
    *   Step 5: Replace the existing Librespeed files in your project with the updated versions.
    *   Step 6: Thoroughly test the speed test functionality in your application after updating Librespeed to ensure compatibility and no regressions are introduced.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Librespeed Vulnerabilities:** Attackers could exploit publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities present in older versions of the Librespeed library to compromise the client-side speed test functionality or user browsers. (Severity: High)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Librespeed Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces the risk by patching known security flaws within the Librespeed library itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: No (Hypothetical - Requires a manual process to check and update)
    *   Location: Project dependency management process for front-end libraries.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Location:  Automated or regularly scheduled checks for Librespeed updates and a streamlined update process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) tailored for Librespeed](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__tailored_for_librespeed.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) tailored for Librespeed
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a CSP policy specifically considering the resources loaded and connections made by the Librespeed library.
    *   Step 2:  For `script-src`, restrict script sources to `'self'` and explicitly allow only trusted CDNs or domains if you are hosting Librespeed assets or related scripts externally. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`.
    *   Step 3: For `connect-src`, limit allowed connection origins to your backend server's domain and any specific third-party servers Librespeed might need to communicate with (if any, based on your configuration and extensions).
    *   Step 4: Review other CSP directives (like `style-src`, `img-src`, `font-src`) and configure them to be restrictive, allowing only necessary sources for Librespeed and your application.
    *   Step 5: Test the CSP policy in a development environment to ensure it doesn't break Librespeed functionality and then deploy it to production. Monitor browser console for CSP violations related to Librespeed and adjust the policy as needed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) related to Librespeed integration:** Prevents injection of malicious scripts that could exploit vulnerabilities in how Librespeed is integrated or used within your application, even if Librespeed itself is secure. (Severity: High)
    *   **Compromised Librespeed Assets (Indirect):** Limits the damage if Librespeed assets from a CDN or your server were somehow compromised, as CSP would restrict execution of unauthorized scripts. (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) related to Librespeed integration: Significantly reduces the risk by controlling script execution context.
    *   Compromised Librespeed Assets (Indirect): Moderately reduces the risk by limiting the impact of compromised assets.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: Partially (Hypothetical - A general CSP might exist, but not specifically tuned for Librespeed)
    *   Location: Web server configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or application framework.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Location:  Refine existing CSP or implement a new CSP policy that is specifically tailored to the resource requirements and security context of the Librespeed library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Librespeed Hosted Assets](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for_librespeed_hosted_assets.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Librespeed Hosted Assets
*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Generate SRI hashes for the Librespeed JavaScript and CSS files if you are serving them from your own server or a CDN. Use tools like `openssl` or online SRI generators.
    *   Step 2: When including Librespeed JavaScript and CSS files in your HTML, add the `integrity` attribute to the `<script>` and `<link>` tags. Set the value to the generated SRI hash, prefixed with the hash algorithm (e.g., `integrity="sha384-HASH_VALUE")`.
    *   Step 3: Include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute on `<script>` and `<link>` tags when using SRI with assets from a different origin (like a CDN hosting Librespeed).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromise of Librespeed Asset Hosting (CDN or Server):** Protects against scenarios where the CDN or your server hosting Librespeed files is compromised and malicious code is injected into the Librespeed JavaScript or CSS. (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Librespeed Assets:** Reduces the risk of MITM attacks injecting malicious code when Librespeed assets are being loaded by ensuring browser-side integrity verification. (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of Librespeed Asset Hosting (CDN or Server): Moderately reduces the risk by ensuring integrity of Librespeed files.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Librespeed Assets: Moderately reduces the risk by verifying resource integrity during loading.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: No (Hypothetical - SRI is often not implemented for third-party libraries)
    *   Location: HTML files where Librespeed assets are included via `<script>` and `<link>` tags.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Location: Implementation in HTML to add `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes to the `<script>` and `<link>` tags for Librespeed assets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Exposure of Librespeed Debug/Development Features](./mitigation_strategies/limit_exposure_of_librespeed_debugdevelopment_features.md)

    *   Step 2: Ensure that any Librespeed debug features are explicitly disabled or turned off in your production environment configuration.
    *   Step 3: Remove or comment out any code in your Librespeed integration that might enable verbose logging or detailed error reporting in production.
    *   Step 4: If Librespeed provides configuration options for logging or error reporting, configure them to be minimal and production-appropriate, avoiding excessive detail that could leak information.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Librespeed Debug Output:** Prevents accidental exposure of potentially sensitive information through verbose logs or detailed error messages generated by Librespeed debug features, which could aid attackers. (Severity: Low)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure via Librespeed Debug Output: Minimally reduces the risk of information leakage from Librespeed.
    *   Attack Surface Increase (Minor): Minimally reduces the attack surface related to Librespeed's debug features.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: Yes (Hypothetical - Assuming standard production deployment practices are followed)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Speed Test Functionality: Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks focused on speed tests.
    *   Resource Exhaustion due to Speed Test Abuse: Moderately reduces the risk of resource exhaustion from speed test abuse.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Status: No (Hypothetical - Rate limiting might be in place for general endpoints, but not specifically for speed test endpoints)
    *   Location: Web server configuration or application framework middleware for rate limiting.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Location: Implement rate limiting specifically targeting the server-side endpoints used by the Librespeed speed test client.
