# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a free and open-source internet speed testing tool.
  - Offer accurate and reliable speed test results to users.
  - Enable users to easily test their internet connection speed from any web browser.
  - Support various deployment options, including client-side only and with optional server-side components for advanced features or data collection.
  - Maintain a lightweight and efficient application to minimize resource usage.
- Business Risks:
  - Inaccurate speed test results could damage user trust and the reputation of the tool.
  - Service unavailability due to technical issues or attacks could disrupt users and impact the tool's usability.
  - Data privacy breaches, especially if server-side components are used to collect and store user data (e.g., IP addresses, test results), could lead to legal and reputational damage.
  - Vulnerabilities in the application could be exploited by malicious actors for various purposes, including denial of service, data manipulation, or malware distribution.
  - Lack of updates and maintenance could lead to security vulnerabilities and decreased usability over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open-source code, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
  - security control: Client-side implementation (HTML5/JavaScript) reduces server-side attack surface when deployed as a purely client-side application. (Implemented: Architecture design)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on client-side security measures, which can be bypassed or manipulated by advanced users.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used in client-side or server-side components.
  - accepted risk: Risk of denial-of-service attacks if server-side components are deployed and become publicly accessible.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement regular security scanning of both client-side and server-side code using SAST and DAST tools.
  - security control: Establish a process for security vulnerability reporting and patching.
  - security control: If server-side components are used, implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.
  - security control: If user data is stored server-side, implement encryption at rest and in transit.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection for server-side components.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially before major releases.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for the core speed test functionality as it is designed to be anonymous. If server-side components are extended for user accounts or administrative functions, authentication will be required.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for the core speed test functionality. If server-side components are extended for administrative functions, authorization will be required to control access to sensitive operations.
  - Input Validation: Implement input validation on both client-side and server-side (if used) to prevent injection attacks. Validate user inputs in configuration settings and any data submitted to server-side components.
  - Cryptography: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit. If server-side components store sensitive data, use encryption at rest. Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing accurate internet speed test results to users.
  - Maintaining the availability and accessibility of the speed test application.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - User IP Addresses (if logged by optional backend): Low to Medium sensitivity. IP addresses can be considered personal data in some jurisdictions.
  - Speed Test Results (if stored by optional backend): Low sensitivity. Aggregated results might be more sensitive depending on the context.
  - Application Code and Infrastructure: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to service disruption, data breaches, or malware distribution.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Is there a plan to implement server-side components for data collection or advanced features in the future?
  - What is the expected scale and user base for the application?
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that need to be considered?
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community?
- Assumptions:
  - The primary goal is to provide a free and open-source speed test tool for general public use.
  - The application is intended to be lightweight and efficient.
  - Security is a concern, but performance and ease of use are also important priorities.
  - Deployment will likely be on standard web hosting or cloud platforms.
  - The project will be maintained by a community of developers.
