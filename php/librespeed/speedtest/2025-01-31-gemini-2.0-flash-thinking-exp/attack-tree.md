## Attack Tree Path: [1. Root Goal: Compromise Application via LibreSpeed [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]](./attack_tree_paths/1__root_goal_compromise_application_via_librespeed__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal.  Exploiting vulnerabilities in LibreSpeed can lead to compromising the entire application that integrates it.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Success can have broad impact, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and potentially user data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Client-Side Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]](./attack_tree_paths/2__client-side_exploitation__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the client-side components of LibreSpeed (primarily JavaScript running in the user's browser).
*   **Why High-Risk:** Client-side vulnerabilities are common in web applications and can be relatively easy to exploit. Successful attacks can lead to user data theft, session hijacking, and malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.

    *   **2.1. Exploit LibreSpeed Client-Side Vulnerabilities [High-Risk Path]**
        *   **Description:** Directly targeting vulnerabilities within the JavaScript code of LibreSpeed itself.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** If LibreSpeed code contains vulnerabilities, any application using it is immediately exposed.

            *   **2.1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via LibreSpeed [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]**
                *   **Description:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the web page context through LibreSpeed.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** XSS is a prevalent web vulnerability. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.

                    *   **2.1.1.1. Reflected XSS in LibreSpeed parameters (e.g., `id`, `serverId`) [High-Risk Path]**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in LibreSpeed parameters (like `id` or `serverId`). When a user clicks this link, the malicious script is reflected back and executed by the browser.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** Reflected XSS is relatively easy to exploit and can be delivered through social engineering or other means.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Client-Server Communication [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]](./attack_tree_paths/3__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_client-server_communication__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between the user's browser and the LibreSpeed server.
*   **Why High-Risk:** If communication is not properly secured (especially without HTTPS), attackers on the network path can eavesdrop, modify data, and inject malicious content.

    *   **3.1. Intercept and Modify Speed Test Results [High-Risk Path]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker intercepts the network traffic and alters the speed test results being sent back to the user's browser.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** While potentially less impactful than code injection, manipulating results can mislead users and undermine trust in the application.

            *   **3.1.1. Modify results to show false network performance metrics**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically altering the numerical values of upload/download speeds, latency, etc., to present inaccurate network information.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Can be used for deception or to mask network issues.

    *   **3.2. Inject Malicious Code via Modified Responses [High-Risk Path]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker intercepts the server's response and injects malicious JavaScript code into it before it reaches the user's browser.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** This is a severe attack as it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, similar to XSS, but achieved through network manipulation.

            *   **3.2.1. If communication is not properly secured, inject malicious JavaScript or redirect to attacker-controlled sites. [High-Risk Path]**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the lack of HTTPS to inject malicious JavaScript directly into the HTML or JavaScript responses from the LibreSpeed server, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Direct code injection and redirection can lead to complete compromise of the user's session and system.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Server-Side Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]](./attack_tree_paths/4__server-side_exploitation__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the server-side components of LibreSpeed (if used, e.g., PHP or Node.js scripts).
*   **Why High-Risk:** Server-side vulnerabilities can lead to full server compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.

    *   **4.1. Exploit LibreSpeed Server-Side Vulnerabilities (PHP, Node.js, etc.) [High-Risk Path]**
        *   **Description:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the server-side code of LibreSpeed.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Server-side vulnerabilities are often more critical as they can directly impact the server and all users.

            *   **4.1.1. Code Injection Vulnerabilities (PHP/Node.js) [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]**
                *   **Description:** Injecting malicious code into the server-side application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Code injection vulnerabilities are extremely critical, potentially granting the attacker complete control over the server and its data.

                    *   **4.1.1.1. Command Injection if LibreSpeed executes system commands based on user input (unlikely in core, but possible in extensions) [High-Risk Path]**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a flaw where LibreSpeed server-side code executes system commands based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** Command injection allows attackers to run arbitrary system commands on the server, leading to full server compromise.

                    *   **4.1.1.2. SQL Injection (if LibreSpeed uses a database and has vulnerable queries) [High-Risk Path]**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in database queries to inject malicious SQL code, allowing unauthorized access to or modification of the database.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** SQL injection can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.

                    *   **4.1.1.3. Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI) if LibreSpeed handles file paths based on user input [High-Risk Path]**
                        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in file path handling to access files outside of the intended directory, potentially reading sensitive files or executing malicious code.
                        *   **Why High-Risk:** LFI can lead to information disclosure, and in some cases, code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Lack of Security Best Practices [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]](./attack_tree_paths/5__lack_of_security_best_practices__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to implement fundamental security measures when deploying and integrating LibreSpeed.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Neglecting security best practices significantly increases the likelihood and impact of various attacks.

    *   **5.1. Not using HTTPS for the application and LibreSpeed communication [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]**
        *   **Description:** Failing to encrypt communication using HTTPS.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Without HTTPS, all communication is in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and MitM attacks, as described in section 3.

    *   **5.2. Outdated LibreSpeed version with known vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]**
        *   **Description:** Using an old version of LibreSpeed that contains publicly known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Known vulnerabilities are easy to exploit as attack techniques are often readily available.

    *   **5.3. Insufficient security testing of the application with integrated LibreSpeed [CRITICAL NODE] [High-Risk Path]**
        *   **Description:** Not conducting adequate security testing (like penetration testing or vulnerability scanning) to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the application and its LibreSpeed integration.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Lack of testing means vulnerabilities are likely to remain undiscovered and exploitable in production.
