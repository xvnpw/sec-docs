# Attack Surface Analysis for librespeed/speedtest

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Client-Side Configuration](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_client-side_configuration.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from injecting malicious scripts into the web page through client-side configuration parameters used by `librespeed/speedtest`.

**Speedtest Contribution:** `librespeed/speedtest` accepts configuration options (like `testServerIp`, `testServerName`, custom URLs) that, if sourced from untrusted client-side data (URL parameters, cookies) and not sanitized, can be exploited for XSS. This is directly related to how the application configures and uses `librespeed/speedtest`.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious `testServerName` parameter containing JavaScript code. If the application directly uses this parameter to configure `librespeed/speedtest` and displays it without encoding, the script will execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the web page.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all client-side inputs used to configure `librespeed/speedtest`.  Use appropriate encoding techniques (like HTML entity encoding) when displaying any configuration parameters or data derived from them.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded and restrict inline JavaScript execution.
*   **Avoid Dynamic Configuration from Untrusted Sources:**  Prefer server-side configuration or hardcoded values for sensitive `librespeed/speedtest` options whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Speed Test Results Display](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_speed_test_results_display.md)

**Description:** XSS vulnerabilities occurring when displaying speed test results, especially if the results contain data originating from potentially attacker-controlled sources (e.g., server responses, custom messages).

**Speedtest Contribution:** `librespeed/speedtest` displays results that might include server names, IP addresses, or custom messages from the server. If the application displays these results without proper output encoding, and if the server is compromised or malicious, XSS is possible. This is directly tied to how `librespeed/speedtest` presents data and how the application handles it.

**Example:** A malicious server used for speed testing is configured to return a crafted server name or custom message containing malicious JavaScript. If the application displays this server name in the results page without encoding, the script will execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the web page.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Output Encoding:**  Always encode speed test results before displaying them on the page. Use HTML entity encoding for text content.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to further mitigate XSS risks.
*   **Server-Side Validation of Results:** If possible, validate or sanitize data received from the speed test server on the server-side before displaying it to the user.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/server-side_denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:**  Overwhelming the server with a flood of speed test requests, leading to resource exhaustion and service disruption.

**Speedtest Contribution:** `librespeed/speedtest` functionality inherently involves server-side processing for handling test requests, serving files, and potentially processing results.  A large number of concurrent speed tests can strain server resources. This is a direct consequence of offering speed test functionality.

**Example:** An attacker launches a botnet to initiate a massive number of speed tests against the application's server simultaneously. This overwhelms the server's CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:**  Service disruption, application unavailability, financial losses, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Rate Limiting (Server-Side):** Implement robust server-side rate limiting to restrict the number of speed tests from a single IP address or user within a given timeframe.
*   **Resource Monitoring and Scaling:** Monitor server resource utilization and implement auto-scaling mechanisms to handle traffic spikes.
*   **Queueing and Throttling:**  Use request queues and throttling mechanisms to manage incoming speed test requests and prevent server overload.
*   **Optimize Server-Side Code:** Optimize server-side code related to speed test handling for performance and efficiency.
