# Threat Model Analysis for librespeed/speedtest

## Threat: [Malicious Server Redirect](./threats/malicious_server_redirect.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Server Redirect

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the application's configuration mechanism or performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to replace the legitimate speed test server URLs used by `librespeed/speedtest` with URLs pointing to a server under their control. When the speed test runs, `librespeed/speedtest` connects to the attacker's server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malware Delivery:** The attacker's server can serve malicious files disguised as test data, potentially infecting the user's device via `librespeed/speedtest`'s data download functionality.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Data uploaded during the test is sent to the attacker's server via `librespeed/speedtest`'s data upload functionality, potentially exposing sensitive information if the application inadvertently includes it.
    *   **Fake Results:** The attacker's server can return manipulated speed test results to `librespeed/speedtest`, misleading the user.
*   **Affected Component:** `librespeed/speedtest`'s configuration loading mechanism, network request functions for download and upload.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for retrieving the `librespeed/speedtest` configuration and server URLs.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums or signatures) for the configuration file used by `librespeed/speedtest`.
    *   Hardcode server URLs within the application's configuration for `librespeed/speedtest` if feasible and the number of servers is limited.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization if server URLs for `librespeed/speedtest` are configurable by administrators.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration Injection](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_configuration_injection.md)

**Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration Injection

*   **Description:** If the application dynamically generates the `librespeed/speedtest` configuration that is then used by the library, based on user input or data from external sources without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the configuration. This malicious configuration is then processed by `librespeed/speedtest`, leading to the execution of the injected script in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal the user's session cookies through malicious scripts executed via `librespeed/speedtest`'s configuration.
    *   **Credential Theft:** The attacker can inject code to capture user credentials entered on the page, leveraging the context where `librespeed/speedtest` is running.
    *   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** The attacker can redirect the user to phishing or malware distribution websites through scripts injected into `librespeed/speedtest`'s configuration.
*   **Affected Component:** Application's code responsible for generating the `librespeed/speedtest` configuration, which is then consumed by `librespeed/speedtest`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict output encoding and sanitization when generating the `librespeed/speedtest` configuration.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts, mitigating the impact of injected scripts within `librespeed/speedtest`.
    *   Avoid dynamically generating configuration for `librespeed/speedtest` based on untrusted user input. If necessary, use a secure templating engine and escape user-provided data.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `librespeed/speedtest`](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__librespeedspeedtest_.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `librespeed/speedtest`

*   **Description:** The `librespeed/speedtest` library itself might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could directly exploit these vulnerabilities within the `librespeed/speedtest` code if the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of the library.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability within `librespeed/speedtest`. It could range from arbitrary code execution on the client-side within the context of the speed test, to information disclosure related to the user's network or browser, or denial of service by crashing the speed test functionality.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable module or function within the `librespeed/speedtest` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the `librespeed/speedtest` library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `librespeed/speedtest`.
    *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify and manage dependencies with known vulnerabilities in `librespeed/speedtest`.
