# Attack Surface Analysis for librespeed/speedtest

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_output.md)

**Description:**  The application embedding LibreSpeed might display test results or other data *provided by LibreSpeed* without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser.

**How Speedtest Contributes:** LibreSpeed *generates output* that is often directly displayed to the user (e.g., download speed, upload speed, latency). If this output isn't properly escaped or sanitized by the embedding application, it becomes an XSS vector.

**Example:** A malicious actor could manipulate the server name or other data *returned by a compromised LibreSpeed server* (or a man-in-the-middle attack) to include a `<script>` tag. When the embedding application displays this data, the script executes in the user's browser.

**Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Output Encoding:**  The embedding application must properly encode all data *received from LibreSpeed* before displaying it in the browser. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript contexts).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration Parameters](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_configuration_parameters.md)

**Description:** If the embedding application allows user-controlled input to influence *LibreSpeed's configuration* (e.g., server URLs, test endpoints) without proper sanitization, malicious scripts can be injected.

**How Speedtest Contributes:** *LibreSpeed's configuration* often involves URLs and other string values. If the embedding application doesn't sanitize these inputs before passing them to *LibreSpeed's client-side JavaScript*, it can lead to XSS.

**Example:** An attacker could manipulate a URL parameter used to specify the *LibreSpeed server endpoint* to include a JavaScript payload. When *LibreSpeed's client-side code* uses this unsanitized URL, the script executes.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:**  The embedding application must sanitize all user-provided input before using it to configure LibreSpeed. This includes validating and escaping potentially dangerous characters.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid allowing user input to directly control sensitive configuration parameters if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/server-side_denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a large number of requests to *LibreSpeed's server-side endpoints* (especially the upload/download test endpoints) to overwhelm the server and cause a denial of service.

**How Speedtest Contributes:** *LibreSpeed provides endpoints* specifically designed for transferring large amounts of data, making them potential targets for DoS attacks.

**Example:** An attacker could use a botnet to send a flood of requests to the `garbage.php` or `empty.php` endpoints, consuming server bandwidth and processing power, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:**  Application unavailability, service disruption, potential infrastructure costs due to increased resource usage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on requests to *LibreSpeed's server-side endpoints*.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious traffic patterns and DoS attacks.
*   **Resource Limits:** Configure web server and application server resource limits to prevent a single process from consuming all available resources.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Using a CDN can help distribute traffic and absorb some of the impact of a DoS attack.
