# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for filp/whoops

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable `whoops` in Production (Conditional Initialization)](./mitigation_strategies/disable__whoops__in_production__conditional_initialization_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Environment Detection:** Utilize a reliable method to determine the application's current environment (e.g., `APP_ENV` environment variable, framework-specific configuration).
2.  **Conditional Logic:** Enclose the entire `whoops` initialization block within an `if` statement (or equivalent conditional construct).  This condition should *only* evaluate to `true` when the environment is *not* `production`.  Commonly, this means checking if `APP_ENV` is equal to 'development', 'staging', 'local', etc., but *never* 'production'.
3.  **Code Example (Conceptual - Adapt to your framework):**

    ```php
    if (getenv('APP_ENV') !== 'production') { // Or your framework's equivalent
        $whoops = new \Whoops\Run;
        $whoops->pushHandler(new \Whoops\Handler\PrettyPageHandler);
        $whoops->register();
    }
    ```
4.  **Configuration File Separation (If Applicable):** If your framework uses separate configuration files for different environments, ensure that the `whoops` initialization code is *only* present in the configuration files for non-production environments.
5. **Testing:** After implementing, trigger errors in your production environment and verify that no whoops output is shown.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Critical Severity):** Prevents the display of stack traces, request variables, environment variables, and server details in the production environment. This is the *primary* threat `whoops` poses.
    *   **Reconnaissance (High Severity):** Eliminates the ability for attackers to gather detailed information about the application's internal workings from error pages.
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation (High Severity):** Makes it significantly harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities by removing the detailed error information that could guide them.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced to effectively zero, *provided the conditional logic is correctly implemented and tested*.
    *   **Reconnaissance:** Risk significantly reduced; attackers cannot use `whoops` output for reconnaissance.
    *   **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Risk significantly reduced; attackers lack the detailed error information to aid exploitation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Conditional initialization is present in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`, using the `APP_ENV` environment variable.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  The implementation relies solely on the `APP_ENV` variable.  A more robust approach might involve checking multiple indicators to confirm the environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize `whoops` Output (Highly Discouraged - Last Resort)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize__whoops__output__highly_discouraged_-_last_resort_.md)

**Description:** This strategy is *strongly discouraged* due to its inherent complexity and high risk of failure. It should only be considered in extremely limited, controlled circumstances where `whoops` *must* be used (e.g., a tightly controlled internal debugging tool), and even then, with extreme caution.
1.  **Custom `Whoops\Handler`:** Create a custom handler class that extends one of `whoops`'s built-in handlers (e.g., `PrettyPageHandler`).
2.  **Override Methods:** Override methods like `handle()` or those responsible for generating specific parts of the output (e.g., stack trace rendering, variable display).
3.  **Filtering/Redaction:** Within the overridden methods, implement logic to:
    *   **Filter:** Remove specific variables or data entirely (e.g., remove all environment variables).
    *   **Redact:** Replace sensitive information with placeholders (e.g., replace database passwords with `*****`).
    *   **Whitelist:** Only display a pre-approved set of variables or data.
4.  **Blacklisting (Less Reliable):** Utilize `whoops`'s built-in `blacklist()` method to attempt to prevent specific variables from being displayed.  This is less reliable than custom handlers, as it's easy to miss sensitive variables.  Example: `$handler->blacklist('_ENV', 'DATABASE_PASSWORD');`
5.  **Example (Conceptual - Highly Discouraged):**

    ```php
    // Conceptual and NOT RECOMMENDED
    class SanitizedWhoopsHandler extends \Whoops\Handler\PrettyPageHandler
    {
        public function handle()
        {
            // Get the default output
            $output = parent::handle();

            // Attempt to remove sensitive information (VERY FRAGILE)
            $output = str_replace($_ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD'], '********', $output);
            // ... other redaction attempts ...

            return $output;
        }
    }

    $whoops = new \Whoops\Run;
    $whoops->pushHandler(new SanitizedWhoopsHandler);
    $whoops->register();
    ```
6. **Extensive, Rigorous Testing:**  Thoroughly test *every* possible error scenario to ensure that sensitive information is *never* leaked.  This is extremely difficult and time-consuming.  Automated testing is essential, but manual verification is also crucial.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Critical Severity):** *Attempts* to mitigate information disclosure, but with a very high probability of failure.  It's extremely difficult to guarantee complete sanitization.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction is *unreliable and likely incomplete*.  This is *not* a recommended approach for production or any environment with sensitive data.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented (and should not be in most cases).

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Everything. This strategy is generally discouraged.
