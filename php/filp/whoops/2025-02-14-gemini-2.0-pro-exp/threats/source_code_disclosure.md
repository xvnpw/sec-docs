Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Source Code Disclosure" threat related to the `whoops` library, structured as you requested:

# Deep Analysis: Source Code Disclosure via Whoops

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Source Code Disclosure" threat associated with the `whoops` library, identify the specific mechanisms that could lead to this vulnerability, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the risk.  We aim to go beyond the high-level description and delve into the code-level interactions that could expose sensitive information.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `whoops` library (https://github.com/filp/whoops) and its potential to leak source code snippets when errors occur.  We will consider:

*   **Targeted `whoops` Components:**  `PrettyPageHandler` and `Frame` classes, including methods like `getFileContents()`.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  How an attacker might intentionally trigger errors to exploit `whoops`.
*   **Information Exposed:**  The types of information that could be revealed (code logic, file paths, comments).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Both the provided mitigations and potential additional, more granular controls.
*   **Production vs. Development Environments:**  The crucial distinction between these environments and how `whoops` should be configured in each.
* We will not cover general web application vulnerabilities unrelated to `whoops`.
* We will not cover vulnerabilities in other error handling libraries.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant parts of the `whoops` source code (specifically `PrettyPageHandler` and `Frame`) to understand how source code snippets are retrieved and displayed.
2.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Expand on the provided threat description to identify specific attack scenarios.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify potential weaknesses in `whoops`'s handling of source code that could be exploited.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations and suggest improvements or alternatives.
5.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document the findings, attack scenarios, and mitigation recommendations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat: Source Code Disclosure

### 2.1. Threat Description Refinement

The original threat description is a good starting point, but we need to be more specific about how an attacker might exploit `whoops`.  Here are some refined attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1:  Forced Exception with Crafted Input:** An attacker identifies a code path that is vulnerable to a specific type of exception (e.g., a type error, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access).  They craft malicious input that triggers this exception, causing `whoops` to display the relevant source code snippet.  This is the most likely and dangerous scenario.

*   **Scenario 2:  Exploiting Configuration Errors:**  If `whoops` is accidentally left enabled in a production environment *and* the application is configured in a way that allows unhandled exceptions to propagate to the user, *any* unexpected error could trigger source code disclosure.  This highlights the importance of proper configuration.

*   **Scenario 3:  Path Traversal (Less Likely, but Worth Considering):**  While `whoops` itself likely doesn't directly handle user-provided file paths, if the application code *around* `whoops` is vulnerable to path traversal, an attacker might be able to influence the file path used by `Frame::getFileContents()`.  This would be a combination of an application vulnerability and `whoops`'s display functionality.

### 2.2. Vulnerability Analysis (Code-Level)

Let's examine the key components and potential vulnerabilities:

*   **`PrettyPageHandler`:** This class is responsible for generating the HTML output that the user sees.  It iterates through the stack trace and, for each frame, calls methods on the `Frame` object to get the source code snippet.  The key vulnerability here is that `PrettyPageHandler` *does not sanitize or restrict the source code it displays*.  It relies entirely on the `Frame` class to provide the correct snippet.

*   **`Frame::getFileContents()`:** This method (and related methods like `getFileLines()`) is responsible for reading the source code from the file system.  Here are the potential vulnerabilities:
    *   **No Input Validation (Indirect):**  `getFileContents()` itself doesn't take user input directly.  It reads the file path from the stack trace.  However, if the application code that *generates* the stack trace is vulnerable to path manipulation, this could indirectly affect `getFileContents()`.
    *   **Full File Read (Potentially):** Depending on the implementation, `getFileContents()` might read the entire file, even if only a few lines are needed for the snippet.  This could expose more information than necessary.  A more secure approach would be to read only the relevant lines.
    * **No whitelisting:** There is no mechanism to restrict which files can be read.

*   **Stack Trace Generation (Application-Level):**  The stack trace itself is generated by the PHP interpreter and the application's error handling mechanisms.  If the application has vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to influence the stack trace (e.g., by manipulating function calls or file inclusions), this could indirectly affect `whoops`.

### 2.3. Information Exposed

The following types of information could be exposed through `whoops`:

*   **Source Code Snippets:**  The most obvious exposure.  These snippets reveal the application's logic, including:
    *   **Control Flow:**  How the application handles different inputs and conditions.
    *   **Data Structures:**  How data is stored and manipulated.
    *   **Algorithm Details:**  The specific algorithms used by the application.
    *   **Vulnerable Code Patterns:**  Snippets might reveal common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or insecure file handling.

*   **File Paths:**  The stack trace includes the full file paths of the files involved in the error.  This can reveal:
    *   **Directory Structure:**  The organization of the application's files.
    *   **Server Configuration:**  Hints about the server's operating system and file system layout.
    *   **Sensitive File Locations:**  Paths to configuration files, database connection details, or other sensitive resources.

*   **Comments:**  Source code comments can contain:
    *   **Developer Notes:**  Explanations of the code's purpose, which could reveal sensitive information.
    *   **TODOs and FIXMEs:**  Indicators of known bugs or weaknesses.
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials (Extremely Bad Practice, but Possible):**  Developers might accidentally leave passwords, API keys, or other secrets in comments.

*   **Variable Values (Potentially):**  While `whoops` primarily focuses on source code, it might also display the values of variables at the time of the error.  This could expose sensitive data if those variables contain user input, session tokens, or other confidential information.

### 2.4. Mitigation Analysis

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigations and suggest improvements:

*   **Production Disable (Essential):**  This is the most crucial mitigation.  `whoops` should *never* be enabled in a production environment.  This can be achieved through:
    *   **Conditional Loading:**  Use environment variables or configuration files to load `whoops` only in development environments.  For example:

        ```php
        if (getenv('APP_ENV') === 'development') {
            $whoops = new \Whoops\Run;
            $whoops->pushHandler(new \Whoops\Handler\PrettyPageHandler);
            $whoops->register();
        }
        ```

    *   **Dependency Management:**  Use a dependency manager (like Composer) to exclude `whoops` from production builds.  This is a more robust approach than relying solely on conditional loading.

*   **Remove Sensitive Comments (Good Practice):**  This is a general security best practice, not specific to `whoops`.  Developers should never include sensitive information in comments.  Code reviews and automated tools can help enforce this.

*   **Additional Mitigations (Beyond the Provided):**

    *   **Whitelist Allowed Files (Strong Recommendation):**  Implement a mechanism to restrict the files that `whoops` can read.  This could be a configuration option that specifies a list of allowed directories or file patterns.  This would prevent `whoops` from accessing sensitive files even if an attacker manages to trigger an error in an unexpected location.

    *   **Limit Snippet Size (Good Practice):**  Modify `Frame::getFileContents()` (or related methods) to read only a limited number of lines around the error location.  This reduces the amount of code exposed.

    *   **Sanitize Output (Defense in Depth):**  Even with other mitigations in place, it's a good idea to sanitize the output of `PrettyPageHandler` to prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities.  While `whoops` is primarily displaying code, it's still rendering HTML, and unexpected input could potentially lead to issues.

    *   **Log Errors Securely (Essential):**  In production, errors should be logged to a secure location (e.g., a log file or a centralized logging service) *without* exposing any sensitive information to the user.  This allows developers to debug issues without compromising security.

    *   **Custom Error Handler (Alternative):**  Instead of relying on `whoops` even in development, consider creating a custom error handler that provides the necessary debugging information without exposing raw source code. This gives you complete control over the output.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Source Code Disclosure" threat associated with `whoops` is a serious vulnerability that can expose sensitive information about an application.  The primary mitigation is to **completely disable `whoops` in production environments**.  Additional mitigations, such as whitelisting allowed files, limiting snippet sizes, and sanitizing output, can further reduce the risk.  Developers should also follow secure coding practices, such as removing sensitive information from comments and logging errors securely. By combining these strategies, the risk of source code disclosure via `whoops` can be effectively minimized.
