## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Expose Sensitive Data or Achieve Code Execution via Whoops](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_expose_sensitive_data_or_achieve_code_execution_via_whoops.md)

*   **Description:** This is the attacker's ultimate objective. All attack paths within this sub-tree lead to this outcome.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Preventing any of the child nodes from being successfully exploited will prevent this goal from being achieved.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 1. Excessive Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1__excessive_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the primary attack vector, focusing on Whoops' tendency to reveal sensitive information when misconfigured or when errors occur.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   Disable Whoops in production environments.
    *   Configure Whoops to redact sensitive information (stack traces, environment variables, request data).
    *   Implement robust error handling to prevent uncontrolled error propagation.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1.1 Stack Trace Leak](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_1_stack_trace_leak.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting Whoops' stack trace display to gain insights into the application's source code and structure.
*   **1.1.1 Trigger Error to Reveal Source Code Structure [HR]**
    *   *Description:* The attacker intentionally causes an application error (e.g., providing invalid input, requesting a non-existent resource) to trigger Whoops' error handling and display a stack trace.
    *   *Likelihood:* High (if Whoops is enabled in production or misconfigured)
    *   *Impact:* Medium to High (reveals code structure, file paths, and potentially sensitive data within the code)
    *   *Effort:* Low
    *   *Skill Level:* Low
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
*   **1.1.2 Parse Stack Trace to Identify Vulnerabilities [HR]**
    *   *Description:* The attacker analyzes the revealed stack trace to identify potential vulnerabilities, such as outdated libraries, insecure coding practices, or logic flaws within the application's code.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (depends on attacker skill and the presence of vulnerabilities)
    *   *Impact:* High (successful identification leads to targeted exploitation)
    *   *Effort:* Medium
    *   *Skill Level:* Medium
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* High
*   **1.1.3 Use Leaked Information to Aid Further Attacks [HR]**
    *   *Description:* The attacker leverages the information gained from the stack trace (vulnerabilities, code structure, etc.) to craft more specific and effective attacks against the application.
    *   *Likelihood:* High (if vulnerabilities are found)
    *   *Impact:* High (can lead to complete compromise)
    *   *Effort:* Variable (depends on the vulnerability)
    *   *Skill Level:* Variable (depends on the vulnerability)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Variable (depends on the subsequent attack)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1.2 Environment Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_2_environment_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting Whoops' potential to display sensitive environment variables and server configuration details.
*   **1.2.1 Expose Server Configuration (e.g., DB Credentials) [HR]**
    *   *Description:* The attacker triggers an error that causes Whoops to display server configuration information, potentially including database credentials, API keys, or other secrets stored in environment variables.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (if Whoops is misconfigured and sensitive data is in environment variables)
    *   *Impact:* High (direct access to sensitive data)
    *   *Effort:* Low
    *   *Skill Level:* Low
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
*   **1.2.2 Expose Loaded Modules (e.g., PHP Version) [HR]**
    *   *Description:* Whoops reveals the versions of loaded software components (e.g., PHP, web server, libraries), which allows the attacker to identify known vulnerabilities associated with those specific versions.
    *   *Likelihood:* High (if Whoops is enabled and not configured to hide this)
    *   *Impact:* Medium (facilitates vulnerability research)
    *   *Effort:* Low
    *   *Skill Level:* Low
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
*   **1.2.3 Use Environment Variables to Gain Access [HR]**
    *   *Description:* The attacker directly uses the exposed sensitive environment variables (e.g., database credentials) to gain unauthorized access to the application or its resources.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (depends on the sensitivity of the exposed variables)
    *   *Impact:* High (can lead to direct access or further exploitation)
    *   *Effort:* Low (if credentials are exposed)
    *   *Skill Level:* Low to Medium
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* High
