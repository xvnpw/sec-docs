## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Pretty Page Handler Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_pretty_page_handler_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the Whoops pretty page handler, which is responsible for rendering error information in a user-friendly HTML format.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code via Error Message](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_code_via_error_message.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker attempts to inject malicious code (typically HTML or JavaScript) into error messages that are displayed by Whoops. This can be achieved by providing crafted input that triggers an error and includes the malicious payload, or by exploiting application logic flaws that lead to attacker-controlled data being included in error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Output Sanitization in Pretty Page Handler](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_lack_of_output_sanitization_in_pretty_page_handler.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The Whoops pretty page handler fails to properly sanitize or encode the error message content before rendering it in HTML. This allows injected malicious code to be interpreted and executed by the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary JavaScript in User's Browser (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_execute_arbitrary_javascript_in_user's_browser__xss_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  As a result of the lack of output sanitization, the injected malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user's browser when they view the error page. This can lead to various attacks, including stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Information Disclosure via Verbose Error Details](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_information_disclosure_via_verbose_error_details.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path exploits the tendency of Whoops to display detailed error information, which can inadvertently reveal sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger Error Revealing Sensitive Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_error_revealing_sensitive_configuration.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers an error condition that causes the application to expose sensitive configuration details within the Whoops error output. This might include database credentials, API keys, internal service URLs, or other confidential information that is present in configuration files or environment variables and is inadvertently included in error messages or stack traces.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Error Reporting Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_error_reporting_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path involves an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the application's configuration and modifying the Whoops settings to increase the verbosity of error reporting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Gain Access to Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_access_to_configuration_files.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations (not directly within Whoops, but enabling this attack) to gain access to the application's configuration files. This could involve exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities, insecure file permissions, or gaining access to the server through other means.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Modify Whoops Configuration to Increase Verbosity](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_modify_whoops_configuration_to_increase_verbosity.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Once access to the configuration files is obtained, the attacker modifies the Whoops settings to enable debug mode, disable error masking, or increase the level of detail in error reporting. This makes it easier to extract sensitive information from subsequent errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exfiltrate Sensitive Information via Whoops Error Display](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exfiltrate_sensitive_information_via_whoops_error_display.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal. By exploiting the vulnerabilities in the pretty page handler or by manipulating the error reporting configuration, the attacker successfully extracts sensitive information that is displayed by Whoops. This information can then be used for further malicious activities.
