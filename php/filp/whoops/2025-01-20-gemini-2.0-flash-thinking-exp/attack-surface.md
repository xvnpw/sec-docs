# Attack Surface Analysis for filp/whoops

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure (General)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure__general_.md)

* **Description:** Exposure of sensitive application details, internal workings, or data to unauthorized individuals.
* **How Whoops Contributes:** Whoops displays detailed error pages containing stack traces, code snippets, environment variables, and potentially other sensitive information when an error occurs.
* **Example:** A user encounters an error, and the Whoops error page reveals the database connection string, including the username and password.
* **Impact:**  Can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, further exploitation of vulnerabilities, and reputational damage.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (in production), High (in development/staging if accessible externally)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Disable Whoops in production environments.**
    * Use generic error handling in production that logs errors securely without exposing details to users.
    * Configure Whoops in development/staging to only be accessible from specific IP addresses or authenticated sessions.
    * Review the information displayed by Whoops and ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently exposed in error messages or environment variables.

## Attack Surface: [Source Code Exposure](./attack_surfaces/source_code_exposure.md)

* **Description:** Revealing the application's source code to unauthorized individuals.
* **How Whoops Contributes:** Whoops displays code snippets surrounding the line where the error occurred, potentially exposing proprietary algorithms, business logic, or security vulnerabilities.
* **Example:** A stack trace displayed by Whoops shows the code for a critical authentication function, revealing its implementation details.
* **Impact:** Allows attackers to understand the application's inner workings, identify vulnerabilities more easily, and potentially reverse engineer the application.
* **Risk Severity:** High (in production)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Disable Whoops in production environments.**
    * Ensure proper access controls to development and staging environments.
    * Avoid including sensitive logic directly in code that might be displayed in error messages.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_disclosure.md)

* **Description:** Exposing environment variables, which often contain sensitive configuration data.
* **How Whoops Contributes:** Whoops typically displays a list of environment variables active at the time of the error. These variables can contain API keys, database credentials, secret keys, and other sensitive information.
* **Example:** The Whoops error page displays an environment variable named `DATABASE_PASSWORD` with the actual database password.
* **Impact:** Direct compromise of sensitive credentials, allowing attackers to access other systems or data.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (in production), High (in development/staging if accessible externally)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Disable Whoops in production environments.**
    * Carefully review environment variables and avoid storing sensitive information directly in them if possible. Use secure secret management solutions.
    * If using environment variables for secrets, ensure they are not easily guessable and have appropriate access restrictions on the server.

## Attack Surface: [Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Less Likely, but Possible)](./attack_surfaces/potential_remote_code_execution__rce___less_likely__but_possible_.md)

* **Description:**  Exploiting a vulnerability within Whoops itself to execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **How Whoops Contributes:** While less common, vulnerabilities could theoretically exist in Whoops' code parsing or rendering logic that could be exploited to achieve RCE. This is a higher risk if Whoops processes untrusted data in a vulnerable way.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a specific error condition or input that triggers a vulnerability in Whoops, allowing them to execute shell commands on the server.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server and application.
* **Risk Severity:** High (if a vulnerability exists)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Disable Whoops in production environments.**
    * Keep Whoops updated to the latest version to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    * Follow secure coding practices and perform regular security audits of the application and its dependencies.
