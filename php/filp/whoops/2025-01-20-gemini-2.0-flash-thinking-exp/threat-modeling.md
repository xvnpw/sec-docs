# Threat Model Analysis for filp/whoops

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Information in Production](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_production.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to detailed error pages in a production environment where `whoops` is incorrectly enabled. This allows them to view sensitive information displayed *by `whoops`*.

**Impact:** Exposure of source code, file paths, environment variables (including API keys, database credentials), configuration details, and internal application logic. This can lead to account compromise, data breaches, and further exploitation of vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** The core error handling mechanism and the exception rendering logic within `whoops`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly disable `whoops` in production environments.** Use environment-based configuration to ensure it's only active during development.

## Threat: [Disclosure of Environment Variables and Configuration](./threats/disclosure_of_environment_variables_and_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker views environment variables and configuration details *displayed by `whoops`*. This can reveal sensitive credentials, API keys, and internal system configurations.

**Impact:**  Direct access to sensitive credentials can lead to immediate compromise of databases, external services, and other critical components. Understanding internal configurations can aid in crafting targeted attacks.

**Affected Component:** The component within `whoops` that displays environment variables and potentially configuration values present in the application's context.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable `whoops` in production.

## Threat: [Source Code Disclosure](./threats/source_code_disclosure.md)

**Description:** An attacker views source code snippets *displayed by `whoops`* in error messages. This allows them to understand the application's logic and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Attackers can gain insights into insecure coding practices, logic flaws, and potential entry points for attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or authentication bypasses.

**Affected Component:** The code snippet rendering feature of `whoops` that displays lines of code around the error location.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure `whoops` is disabled in production.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `whoops` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__whoops__library_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, `whoops` could potentially contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker.

**Impact:** The impact would depend on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or other security breaches.

**Affected Component:** The entire `whoops` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `whoops` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with `whoops`.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to scan your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
