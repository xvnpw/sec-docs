# Threat Model Analysis for filp/whoops

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers an error in the application, and Whoops displays the error page which includes a list of environment variables. This list might contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets.

**Impact:** If environment variables containing sensitive information are exposed, attackers can gain unauthorized access to critical resources, leading to data breaches, financial loss, or complete system compromise.

**Affected Whoops Component:** `Exception Handler` (specifically the component responsible for rendering the error page and displaying environment data).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable Whoops in Production:** The primary and most effective mitigation is to ensure Whoops is completely disabled in production environments.
*   **Filter Environment Variables:** Configure Whoops to filter or redact sensitive environment variables from the displayed output, even in development environments.
*   **Securely Manage Secrets:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables. Utilize secure secret management solutions or encrypted configuration files.

## Threat: [Disclosure of Internal File Paths and Code Structure](./threats/disclosure_of_internal_file_paths_and_code_structure.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers an error, and the Whoops error page displays detailed stack traces, revealing the internal file paths and directory structure of the application.

**Impact:** Knowing the internal file structure can help attackers understand the application's architecture, identify potential vulnerability points, and potentially exploit known vulnerabilities in specific components or libraries.

**Affected Whoops Component:** `Exception Handler` (specifically the component responsible for generating and displaying stack traces).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable Whoops in Production:** This prevents the exposure of internal paths to external attackers.
*   **Code Obfuscation (Limited Effectiveness):** While not a primary security measure, code obfuscation can make it slightly harder to understand the revealed paths, but it's not a reliable solution against determined attackers. Focus on preventing the information from being exposed in the first place.

## Threat: [Exposure of Application Source Code Snippets](./threats/exposure_of_application_source_code_snippets.md)

**Description:** When an error occurs, Whoops displays snippets of the source code surrounding the line where the error occurred. This can reveal sensitive logic, algorithms, or even hardcoded secrets within the code.

**Impact:** Attackers can gain a deeper understanding of the application's functionality, identify weaknesses in the code, and potentially discover sensitive information like hardcoded API keys or passwords.

**Affected Whoops Component:** `Exception Handler` (specifically the component responsible for fetching and displaying code snippets).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable Whoops in Production:** Prevents the exposure of code snippets in live environments.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the codebase. Utilize secure configuration management and secret management techniques.
*   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and remove any accidentally exposed sensitive information.

## Threat: [Accidental Deployment with Whoops Enabled in Production](./threats/accidental_deployment_with_whoops_enabled_in_production.md)

**Description:** Developers or operations teams mistakenly deploy the application to a production environment with Whoops still enabled.

**Impact:** This immediately exposes the application to all the information disclosure threats mentioned above (environment variables, file paths, code snippets), potentially leading to significant security breaches and data leaks.

**Affected Whoops Component:** The entire `Whoops` library being active in the production environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Deployment Procedures:** Implement well-defined and automated deployment processes that explicitly disable Whoops in production environments.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Utilize environment variables or configuration files to control Whoops's behavior based on the environment (e.g., disable it if `APP_ENV=production`).
*   **Automated Testing and Validation:** Include tests in the deployment pipeline to verify that Whoops is disabled in production builds.
*   **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools to ensure consistent and secure configurations across different environments.
