# Attack Surface Analysis for filp/whoops

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Error Pages](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_error_pages.md)

**Description:** Whoops displays detailed error information, potentially revealing sensitive internal details of the application.

**How Whoops Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Its core functionality is to provide comprehensive error reporting, which includes stack traces, environment variables, request data, and sometimes even source code snippets.

**Example:** A user encountering an error on a production site sees a stack trace revealing internal file paths and function names, giving an attacker insights into the application's structure.

**Impact:**  Attackers gain valuable information about the application's architecture, dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities, making targeted attacks easier. Exposure of credentials or API keys can lead to direct compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if in production), High (if development environment is publicly accessible).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable Whoops entirely in production environments.**
* **Implement a generic error handler for production that logs errors securely and presents a non-revealing message to the user.**
* **Carefully configure Whoops in development to avoid displaying sensitive environment variables or overly detailed information if the development environment is accessible to untrusted individuals.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Stack Traces](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_stack_traces.md)

**Description:** Whoops displays the full stack trace of an error, outlining the sequence of function calls leading to the exception.

**How Whoops Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Stack traces are a primary feature of Whoops' detailed error reporting.

**Example:** A stack trace reveals the use of a specific vulnerable library or the presence of internal API endpoints and their parameters.

**Impact:**  Attackers can understand the application's control flow, identify potential weaknesses in specific functions, and discover internal APIs or data structures.

**Risk Severity:** High (in production).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable Whoops in production.**
* **In development, be mindful of the information revealed in stack traces, especially if the environment is not fully isolated.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** Whoops can be configured to display environment variables.

**How Whoops Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  It has a feature to include environment variables in the error output.

**Example:**  Environment variables containing database credentials, API keys for external services, or other secrets are displayed in the error page.

**Impact:** Direct compromise of the application and connected services through exposed credentials and keys.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if exposed in any environment).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never enable the display of environment variables in production.**
* **In development, be extremely cautious about displaying environment variables and avoid storing sensitive information directly in them if possible.**
* **Use secure methods for managing secrets, even in development.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Request Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_request_data.md)

**Description:** Whoops can display details about the HTTP request that triggered the error, including parameters, headers, and cookies.

**How Whoops Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  It includes request information in its error reporting.

**Example:**  Sensitive user input in request parameters, session IDs in cookies, or authorization tokens in headers are revealed in the error page.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, exposure of personal data, and potential bypass of authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High (if exposed in any environment).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable Whoops in production.**
* **In development, be aware that request data is being displayed and avoid sending sensitive information in requests during development if possible.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Source Code Snippets](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_source_code_snippets.md)

**Description:** Whoops can display snippets of the source code surrounding the line where the error occurred.

**How Whoops Contributes to the Attack Surface:** It has the capability to show code context around the error.

**Example:**  The error page shows a code snippet containing a SQL query vulnerable to injection or reveals insecure coding practices.

**Impact:** Direct identification of vulnerabilities in the code, making exploitation easier for attackers.

**Risk Severity:** High (in production).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable Whoops in production.**
* **In development, be mindful that code snippets are being displayed and avoid committing sensitive or vulnerable code.**

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Error Display](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_error_display.md)

**Description:** If error messages or data displayed by Whoops include user-provided input that is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code.

**How Whoops Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  It renders error messages and potentially unsanitized input within the error page.

**Example:** A malicious string in a URL parameter causes an error, and Whoops displays this string without proper escaping, allowing the execution of embedded JavaScript in the victim's browser.

**Impact:**  Client-side attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, and redirection to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High (if vulnerable).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Ensure that any user-provided data displayed by Whoops (even in development) is properly sanitized or escaped to prevent XSS.**

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Deployment to Production](./attack_surfaces/accidental_deployment_to_production.md)

**Description:**  Whoops, intended for development, is mistakenly left enabled in a production environment.

**How Whoops Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Its presence in production exposes all the aforementioned attack surfaces to the public.

**Example:** Any user encountering an error on the live website is presented with detailed internal information about the application.

**Impact:**  Severe information disclosure leading to a high risk of various attacks and potential full system compromise. Significant reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement strict deployment processes and configurations to ensure Whoops is never enabled in production.**
* **Use environment-specific configuration to automatically disable Whoops in production environments.**
* **Regularly audit production environments to verify that development tools like Whoops are not active.**
* **Educate the development team about the security risks of enabling Whoops in production.**
