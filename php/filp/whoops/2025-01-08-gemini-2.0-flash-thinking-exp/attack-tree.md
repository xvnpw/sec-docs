## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Whoops](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_whoops.md)

* Significance: This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the overall objective of the attack tree. Success at this node means the application has been compromised through vulnerabilities in Whoops.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Whoops](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_whoops.md)

* Significance: Successful exploitation of this node allows the attacker to gain valuable information about the application's internal workings, potentially leading to further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Data in Error Pages](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_data_in_error_pages.md)

* Significance: This node represents the point where sensitive information is directly leaked to the attacker, potentially leading to immediate compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Configuration Reveals Too Much Information](./attack_tree_paths/default_configuration_reveals_too_much_information.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers exploit the common oversight of leaving Whoops in debug mode or with default configurations in production environments. This allows them to observe detailed error messages, stack traces, and file paths, providing insights into the application's structure and potential vulnerabilities.
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: Moderate (Exposure of internal structure, potential vulnerabilities)
    * Mitigation: Disable debug mode and use custom error handling in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Error Messages Contain Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/error_messages_contain_sensitive_data.md)

* Attack Vector: Developers inadvertently include sensitive information (secrets, API keys, internal configurations) directly within exception messages or data passed to the error handler, which is then displayed by Whoops.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Direct exposure of credentials or sensitive data)
    * Mitigation: Sanitize and filter error messages before displaying them. Avoid including sensitive information in exception messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution via Whoops](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution_via_whoops.md)

* Significance: Achieving remote code execution grants the attacker complete control over the server, representing the most severe outcome.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Custom Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_custom_handlers.md)

* This represents a collection of high-risk paths focused on exploiting the flexibility of Whoops' custom handler feature.
    * Impact: Critical (Remote code execution)
    * Mitigation: Implement robust security measures for custom handlers, including secure coding practices, input validation, and access controls.
* Significance: This node is the primary gateway for achieving remote code execution through Whoops. Securing custom handlers is crucial to preventing this high-impact attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Handler Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_handler_configuration.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Whoops configuration (e.g., configuration files, database) and modify it to register a malicious handler that executes arbitrary code.
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Effort: High
        * Mitigation: Secure Whoops configuration files and access to them. Implement proper access controls and validate handler configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Existing Custom Handler](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_existing_custom_handler.md)

* Attack Vector: A developer-created custom handler contains a vulnerability (e.g., insecure deserialization, command injection) that an attacker can exploit to execute arbitrary code.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Effort: Medium/High
        * Mitigation: Thoroughly audit and secure all custom handlers. Follow secure coding practices, especially when dealing with external input or deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage `eval()` or Similar in a Custom Handler (Anti-Pattern)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage__eval____or_similar_in_a_custom_handler__anti-pattern_.md)

* Attack Vector: A poorly written custom handler uses `eval()` or similar functions with attacker-controlled input, allowing direct execution of arbitrary code.
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Effort: Low (if the vulnerable code is identified)
        * Mitigation: Avoid using `eval()` or similar functions with untrusted input in custom handlers.
