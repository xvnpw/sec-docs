# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a versatile and adaptable file system abstraction for PHP developers.
  - Simplify interactions with diverse storage systems, promoting code portability and reducing vendor lock-in.
- Business Goals:
  - Enable PHP applications to seamlessly integrate with various storage solutions using a unified API.
  - Enhance developer productivity by abstracting away the complexities of different storage systems.
  - Facilitate easy switching between storage backends without significant code modifications.
- Business Risks:
  - Data integrity and availability risks if the abstraction layer introduces bugs or mishandles storage operations.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could expose applications to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
  - Performance bottlenecks if the abstraction layer adds overhead or is not optimized for specific storage systems.
  - Compatibility issues with certain storage providers or PHP environments if not thoroughly tested and maintained.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation to prevent path traversal and other file system related vulnerabilities. Implemented within the Flysystem library code.
  - security control: Reliance on underlying storage provider's security mechanisms for access control and data protection. Documented in Flysystem's adapter documentation.
  - security control: Secure coding practices followed during development. Evidenced by code quality and community contributions in the GitHub repository.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in underlying storage providers are outside the scope of Flysystem's control.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of storage adapters by users leading to security issues.
  - accepted risk:  Vulnerabilities in PHP runtime environment or dependent libraries.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for Flysystem library development.
  - security control: Provide secure configuration guidelines and best practices for users when integrating Flysystem with different storage adapters.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Flysystem library.
  - security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning to ensure no known vulnerabilities are present in Flysystem's dependencies.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Flysystem itself does not handle user authentication. Authentication is delegated to the underlying storage provider and managed by the application using Flysystem.
    - Requirement: Ensure that applications using Flysystem are properly authenticating requests to storage providers using secure methods (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Flysystem relies on the authorization mechanisms of the underlying storage provider.
    - Requirement: Applications using Flysystem must implement appropriate authorization logic to control access to files based on user roles and permissions, leveraging the storage provider's capabilities where possible.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Flysystem must rigorously validate all input parameters, especially file paths and names, to prevent path traversal and injection attacks. Implemented within the Flysystem library code.
    - Requirement: Applications using Flysystem should also perform input validation on data before passing it to Flysystem operations.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Flysystem should support encryption of data at rest and in transit if required by the storage provider or application. This is typically handled by the storage adapter or the underlying storage service.
    - Requirement: Applications should consider encrypting sensitive data before storing it using Flysystem, especially when using storage providers that do not offer built-in encryption.
