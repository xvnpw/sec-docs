## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Flysystem Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_flysystem_exploitation.md)

**Description:** The attacker's ultimate goal is to compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to its use of the Flysystem library. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved a significant breach, potentially gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Flysystem Misconfiguration](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_flysystem_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or insecure configuration of Flysystem and its adapters. Misconfiguration is often a simpler attack vector than exploiting code-level vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Adapter Configuration:**
        *   **Description:**  Focuses on weaknesses in how the specific Flysystem adapter (e.g., for AWS S3, local storage, etc.) is configured.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Weak Adapter Credentials:**
                *   **Description:**  Exploiting weak, default, or exposed credentials used to authenticate with the storage backend.
                *   **Attack Vectors:**
                    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exposed Credentials in Code/Config Files:** Credentials are hardcoded in application code or configuration files that are accessible to attackers (e.g., through public repositories, insecure server configurations).
                    *   **Default/Weak Credentials:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for storage adapters.
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Overly Permissive Adapter Permissions:**
                *   **Description:**  Exploiting overly permissive access control settings on the storage backend itself (e.g., publicly readable/writable cloud storage buckets).
                *   **Attack Vectors:**
                    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Publicly Accessible Storage (e.g., S3 bucket misconfiguration):** Cloud storage buckets are misconfigured to allow public access when they should be private.
    *   **Exposed Configuration Information:**
        *   **Description:** Gaining access to sensitive configuration details that reveal information about the Flysystem setup and potentially credentials or paths.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Configuration Files Accessible to Attacker:** Configuration files containing Flysystem settings are accessible to attackers due to misconfigured web servers or directory traversal vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Flysystem API Misuse in Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_flysystem_api_misuse_in_application.md)

**Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities stemming from how developers incorrectly or insecurely use the Flysystem API within the application's code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Path Traversal Vulnerability:**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting insufficient input sanitization when constructing file paths for Flysystem operations, allowing attackers to access files outside of intended directories.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insufficient Input Sanitization on File Paths:** Application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided input used in file paths.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability:**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in file upload functionality that uses Flysystem, allowing attackers to upload malicious files.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] No File Type Validation:** Application does not validate file types during upload.
                *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Upload Malicious Executable Files (Web Shells, Malware):** Attackers upload executable files (e.g., web shells) due to lack of file type validation.
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] No Content Validation/Scanning:** Application does not scan or validate the content of uploaded files.
                *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Upload Files with Malicious Payloads (e.g., XSS, CSRF triggers in HTML files):** Attackers upload files containing malicious payloads like XSS scripts due to lack of content validation.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Insecure File Handling After Retrieval:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application processes files *after* retrieving them from storage using Flysystem.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Direct Execution of Uploaded Files:** Application directly executes uploaded files without proper security measures.
                *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Web Shell Execution:** Direct execution of uploaded web shell files leads to server compromise.
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure File Content Display:** Application displays file content without proper sanitization, leading to client-side vulnerabilities.
                *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] XSS Vulnerabilities when displaying file content without sanitization:** Displaying unsanitized file content (e.g., HTML) leads to Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Flysystem Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_flysystem_library_itself.md)

**Description:**  This path considers exploiting vulnerabilities within the Flysystem library itself, although less likely than misconfiguration or API misuse.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Flysystem Version:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in a specific version of Flysystem being used by the application.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Outdated Flysystem Version Used:** Application uses an outdated version of Flysystem that contains known vulnerabilities.
