# Threat Model Analysis for thephpleague/flysystem

## Threat: [Path Traversal via User Input in File Operations](./threats/path_traversal_via_user_input_in_file_operations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-provided input (e.g., filenames, directory paths) that is directly used in Flysystem file operations (like `read()`, `write()`, `delete()`) to access or modify files outside the intended storage directory. For example, using "../" in a filename. This directly leverages Flysystem's API without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server's filesystem, potential for arbitrary file read or write, leading to information disclosure or system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Filesystem Interface (specifically functions like `read()`, `write()`, `delete()`, `copy()`, `move()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never directly use user input in file paths passed to Flysystem functions.**
    *   Implement a mapping or abstraction layer to translate user-provided identifiers to safe file paths before using them with Flysystem.
    *   Sanitize and validate all user-provided input related to file operations *before* it reaches Flysystem.
    *   Use whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns for filenames that will be used with Flysystem.

## Threat: [Unvalidated File Uploads Leading to Code Execution](./threats/unvalidated_file_uploads_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script, a web shell) through an application using Flysystem without proper validation of the file's content or type. This file is then stored using Flysystem and potentially accessible through the web server, allowing for execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, compromise data, or launch further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Filesystem Interface (specifically the `writeStream()` or `put()` functions used for uploads).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust server-side file validation *before* storing files using Flysystem, including checking file extensions, MIME types, and file content.
    *   Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible by the web server or configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory where Flysystem stores files.
    *   Consider using a dedicated storage service that does not allow script execution, even if using Flysystem as an abstraction.
    *   Implement antivirus or malware scanning on uploaded files before they are handled by Flysystem.

## Threat: [Insecure Local Adapter Usage](./threats/insecure_local_adapter_usage.md)

*   **Description:** When using Flysystem's local adapter, if the application doesn't properly restrict access or sanitize input, an attacker might be able to access or manipulate files outside the intended storage directory on the server's filesystem. This is a direct consequence of how Flysystem interacts with the local filesystem.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, potential for arbitrary file read or write, leading to information disclosure or system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Local Adapter.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using the local adapter for storing sensitive data if possible.
    *   Ensure the storage directory configured for the local adapter has restricted filesystem permissions *at the operating system level*.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any file paths used with the local adapter in Flysystem operations.
    *   Consider using a more secure storage backend and a corresponding Flysystem adapter for sensitive data.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Flysystem Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_flysystem_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An application uses a third-party Flysystem plugin that contains security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through the plugin's interaction with Flysystem to compromise the application or the storage backend.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, directly impacting the application through the Flysystem plugin.
*   **Affected Component:**  Plugins and Extensions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully evaluate the security of any third-party Flysystem plugins before using them.
    *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and changelogs for plugin updates.
    *   Consider the reputation and maintenance status of the plugin before integrating it with Flysystem.
