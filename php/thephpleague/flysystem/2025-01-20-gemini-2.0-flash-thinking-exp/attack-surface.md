# Attack Surface Analysis for thephpleague/flysystem

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided to Flysystem to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
    *   **How Flysystem Contributes:** If the application directly uses unsanitized user-provided input to construct file paths passed to Flysystem methods like `read()`, `write()`, `delete()`, or `copy()`, it becomes vulnerable. Flysystem operates on the provided path.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to download files based on an ID. A malicious user crafts an ID like `../../../../etc/passwd` which, if directly used in `Storage::read($id)`, could potentially expose sensitive system files if the underlying adapter allows it.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, modification or deletion of critical files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly Sanitize User Input:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided input used to construct file paths. Remove or escape potentially malicious characters like `../`.
        *   **Use Whitelisting for Paths/Filenames:** Define a strict set of allowed characters or patterns for filenames and paths.
        *   **Map User Input to Internal Safe Paths:**  Instead of directly using user input in file paths, map user-provided identifiers to internal, safe file paths.
        *   **Utilize Flysystem's Path Manipulation Functions Securely:**  Use functions like `dirname()`, `basename()`, and `pathinfo()` carefully and avoid direct string concatenation for path building.
        *   **Restrict Access at the Adapter Level:** Configure the underlying adapter (e.g., for local filesystem) to restrict the base path Flysystem can access.

## Attack Surface: [Backend Misconfiguration (Impacting Flysystem Operations)](./attack_surfaces/backend_misconfiguration__impacting_flysystem_operations_.md)

*   **Description:**  Insecure configurations of the underlying storage backend directly impact the security of file operations performed through Flysystem.
    *   **How Flysystem Contributes:** Flysystem acts as an interface to the backend. If the backend is misconfigured to allow unauthorized access, Flysystem, by design, will operate within those insecure parameters, making the vulnerability exploitable through the application's use of Flysystem.
    *   **Example:** Using the AWS S3 adapter with a publicly writable bucket policy. Even if the application logic intends to restrict uploads, anyone can upload files to the bucket through the S3 API, bypassing the application's intended controls enforced via Flysystem.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data modification or deletion, resource exploitation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Adhere to Backend Security Best Practices:**  Strictly follow the security guidelines provided by the specific storage backend (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, local filesystem permissions).
        *   **Implement Least Privilege for Backend Access:** Grant the application using Flysystem only the necessary permissions to the storage backend.
        *   **Regularly Audit Backend Configurations:** Periodically review the configuration of the storage backend to identify and rectify any misconfigurations.
        *   **Securely Manage Backend Credentials:**  Store and manage backend credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management systems), avoiding hardcoding them in the application.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Metadata (Leading to High Impact)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_metadata__leading_to_high_impact_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise from how file metadata, accessed and managed through Flysystem, is handled by the application, leading to significant security issues.
    *   **How Flysystem Contributes:** Flysystem provides methods to retrieve and update file metadata. If the application trusts this metadata without sanitization and uses it in security-sensitive contexts, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An application uses file metadata (e.g., content-type) retrieved via Flysystem to determine how to serve a file. A malicious user uploads a file with a manipulated content-type (e.g., `text/html`) which, when served, is treated as HTML by the browser, potentially leading to XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly Sanitize Metadata Output:**  When displaying or using file metadata retrieved from Flysystem, properly sanitize or escape the data to prevent injection attacks like XSS.
        *   **Do Not Trust Metadata Implicitly:**  Validate metadata against expected values or patterns before using it for critical decisions.
        *   **Implement Secondary Verification:** If metadata is used for security-sensitive purposes, implement a secondary verification mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Adapters or Plugins (High Risk)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_adapters_or_plugins__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist in community-developed Flysystem adapters or custom plugins used by the application, posing a significant risk.
    *   **How Flysystem Contributes:** If the application relies on a vulnerable adapter or plugin, the vulnerabilities within that component become a direct part of the application's attack surface through Flysystem's integration mechanism.
    *   **Example:** A community-developed adapter for a specific cloud storage provider has a vulnerability that allows unauthorized file deletion. An application using this adapter is then susceptible to this vulnerability, exploitable through Flysystem's `delete()` method.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potentially remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prioritize Well-Maintained and Reputable Adapters:** Choose adapters that are actively maintained and have a strong security track record.
        *   **Keep Adapters and Plugins Updated:** Regularly update all Flysystem adapters and plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Conduct Security Audits of Custom Plugins:** If using custom-developed plugins, perform thorough security audits and penetration testing.
        *   **Be Aware of Dependencies:** Understand the dependencies of the adapters and plugins you use, as vulnerabilities in those dependencies can also introduce risks.
