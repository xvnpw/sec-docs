## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability (under Read Sensitive Data)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_vulnerability__under_read_sensitive_data_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate file paths provided to Flysystem functions to access files outside the intended directories. This is often achieved using sequences like `../` in the filename.
* **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization of file paths.
* **Potential Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration files, application data, or even system files.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths.
    * Use whitelisting of allowed characters and directory structures.
    * Implement canonicalization to resolve relative paths.
    * Avoid directly using user-provided input in file paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Permissions on Underlying Storage (under Read Sensitive Data)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_permissions_on_underlying_storage__under_read_sensitive_data_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The underlying storage (e.g., local filesystem, S3 bucket) has overly permissive read permissions, allowing Flysystem (and thus an attacker exploiting Flysystem) to access sensitive data.
* **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Misconfiguration of storage access controls.
* **Potential Impact:**  Large-scale data breaches, exposure of confidential information.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Apply the principle of least privilege to storage permissions.
    * Ensure only necessary read permissions are granted to the Flysystem user/credentials.
    * Regularly review and audit storage permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal to overwrite critical files (under Write Malicious Files)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_to_overwrite_critical_files__under_write_malicious_files_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Similar to reading, attackers use path traversal to write malicious files to sensitive locations, potentially overwriting application code, configuration files, or data.
* **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization of file paths, lack of write access control.
* **Potential Impact:** Complete application compromise, code execution, data corruption, denial of service.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all file paths.
    * Restrict write access to only necessary locations.
    * Implement file integrity checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload malicious files to accessible locations (under Write Malicious Files)](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_files_to_accessible_locations__under_write_malicious_files_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the application allows file uploads, attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, configuration files with backdoors) to directories accessible by the web server.
* **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Lack of proper file type validation, insufficient restrictions on upload locations.
* **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution, application takeover, data manipulation.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Restrict allowed file extensions for uploads.
    * Store uploaded files outside the web root.
    * Implement content scanning for malicious code.
    * Use unique and unpredictable filenames for uploaded files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Permissions on Underlying Storage (under Modify Application Logic/Data)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_permissions_on_underlying_storage__under_modify_application_logicdata_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The underlying storage has overly permissive write permissions, allowing attackers to modify critical application files or data through Flysystem.
* **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Misconfiguration of storage access controls.
* **Potential Impact:**  Application compromise, data corruption, denial of service.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Apply the principle of least privilege to storage permissions.
    * Ensure only necessary write permissions are granted to the Flysystem user/credentials.
    * Regularly review and audit storage permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Executable Files (under Execute Arbitrary Code)](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_executable_files__under_execute_arbitrary_code_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload files with executable extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.sh`) to locations accessible by the web server, enabling them to execute arbitrary code.
* **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Lack of restrictions on executable file uploads, insecure upload locations.
* **Potential Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, complete application takeover.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Strictly restrict allowed file extensions for uploads.
    * Store uploaded files outside the web root and prevent direct execution.
    * Implement content scanning for malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (Indirectly via uploaded files) (under Execute Arbitrary Code)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_inclusion_vulnerabilities__indirectly_via_uploaded_files___under_execute_arbitrary_code_dbea176b.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload files containing malicious code and then trick the application into including these files, leading to code execution.
* **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Insecure coding practices regarding file inclusion, lack of input validation on included files.
* **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution, application takeover.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Avoid dynamically including user-provided file paths.
    * If dynamic inclusion is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of file paths.
    * Ensure uploaded files are not directly accessible for inclusion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Flysystem](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_flysystem.md)

* **Significance:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete failure of application security.
* **Potential Impact:** Total loss of control over the application and its data.
* **Actionable Insights:** Implement a layered security approach to prevent any single vulnerability from leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Permissions on Underlying Storage (Both Read and Modify)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_permissions_on_underlying_storage__both_read_and_modify_.md)

* **Significance:** This bypasses Flysystem's intended access controls and grants direct access to the underlying storage, making it a highly critical vulnerability. It enables both reading and writing of sensitive data.
* **Potential Impact:**  Large-scale data breaches, data corruption, application compromise.
* **Actionable Insights:**
    * Rigorously enforce the principle of least privilege on storage permissions.
    * Regularly audit and review storage access controls.
    * Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for storage access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Application Logic/Data via Flysystem](./attack_tree_paths/modify_application_logicdata_via_flysystem.md)

* **Significance:** Successful attacks in this category can directly alter the application's behavior or data, leading to significant damage.
* **Potential Impact:** Application malfunction, data corruption, introduction of backdoors, denial of service.
* **Actionable Insights:** Implement strong access controls for file operations, validate all data written through Flysystem, and use integrity checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code via Flysystem (Less Direct, but Possible)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_via_flysystem__less_direct__but_possible_.md)

* **Significance:** The ability to execute arbitrary code on the server is the most severe form of compromise.
* **Potential Impact:** Complete system takeover, data breaches, malware installation, denial of service.
* **Actionable Insights:**  Prioritize preventing file uploads of executable content, secure file inclusion practices, and keep all dependencies updated to patch deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Permissions on Underlying Storage for deletion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_permissions_on_underlying_storage_for_deletion.md)

* **Significance:** While focused on disruption, the potential for significant data loss makes this a critical point.
* **Potential Impact:**  Permanent loss of critical application data, application outage.
* **Actionable Insights:**  Restrict delete permissions on the underlying storage to the absolute minimum required. Implement data backups and recovery mechanisms.
