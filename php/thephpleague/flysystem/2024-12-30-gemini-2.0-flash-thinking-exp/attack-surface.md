* **Attack Surface: Path Traversal**
    * **Description:** Attackers can access or modify files outside the intended directory by manipulating file paths provided to Flysystem.
    * **How Flysystem Contributes:** Flysystem relies on the application to provide safe and validated file paths. If the application doesn't sanitize user input before passing it to Flysystem methods like `read()`, `write()`, or `delete()`, attackers can manipulate these paths.
    * **Example:** An application allows users to download files based on a filename provided in the URL. An attacker could change the filename to `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to download the server's password file.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification or deletion of critical data, potential for remote code execution if writable paths are compromised.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that influences file paths before passing it to Flysystem. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and path segments.
        * **Path Canonicalization:**  Resolve paths to their canonical form to prevent bypasses using relative paths or symbolic links.
        * **Restricted Access:**  Ensure the application user has the minimum necessary permissions on the underlying filesystem.

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Adapter Configuration & Usage**
    * **Description:** Misconfigured Flysystem adapters or insecure usage patterns can expose vulnerabilities in the underlying storage system.
    * **How Flysystem Contributes:** Flysystem acts as an abstraction layer. If the chosen adapter is not configured securely (e.g., weak credentials for cloud storage, open permissions on local storage) or if the application uses adapter-specific features insecurely, it can create vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** Using the FTP adapter with default or weak credentials, allowing anonymous access to a public cloud storage bucket configured as a Flysystem adapter.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to stored data, data breaches, data manipulation, potential for account compromise in connected services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Adapter Configuration:** Follow the security best practices for the specific Flysystem adapter being used. Use strong credentials, enable encryption where available, and restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
        * **Regular Security Audits:**  Review the configuration of Flysystem adapters and the underlying storage systems regularly.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the application only the necessary permissions to the storage backend.
