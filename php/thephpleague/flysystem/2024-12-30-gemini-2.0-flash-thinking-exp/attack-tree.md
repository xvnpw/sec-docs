Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **CRITICAL NODE: Gain Unauthorized Access to Files Managed by Flysystem**
    * Represents the overarching goal of accessing files without proper authorization.

* **HIGH RISK PATH / CRITICAL NODE: Read Sensitive Files**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Beginner
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * Description: Attacker manipulates file paths provided to Flysystem's read operations to access files outside the intended directories, potentially exposing sensitive data.
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Local Adapter Symlink Vulnerability**
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: High
        * Description: When using the local adapter, an attacker creates symbolic links pointing to sensitive files, which Flysystem might follow, granting unauthorized access.
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Cloud Storage API Misconfiguration**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * Description: If using a cloud storage adapter, attackers exploit misconfigured bucket policies or IAM roles to directly access sensitive files or access them through the application's Flysystem interface.

* **CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate Files Managed by Flysystem**
    * Represents the overarching goal of altering files without proper authorization.

* **HIGH RISK PATH / CRITICAL NODE: Modify Existing Files**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Beginner
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * Description: Similar to reading, attackers manipulate file paths in Flysystem's write operations to overwrite unintended files, potentially corrupting data or injecting malicious content.

* **HIGH RISK PATH / CRITICAL NODE: Delete Files**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Beginner
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * Description: Attackers exploit path traversal vulnerabilities in Flysystem's delete operations to remove unintended files, leading to data loss and potential application malfunction.

* **HIGH RISK PATH / CRITICAL NODE: Upload Malicious Files**
    * **Attack Vector: Bypass File Type Validation**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Beginner
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * Description: Attackers bypass insufficient file type validation mechanisms to upload executable files or files containing malware, potentially leading to code execution or further compromise.

* **CRITICAL NODE: Corrupt Application Data**
    * Represents the overarching goal of damaging the application's data integrity.

* **HIGH RISK PATH: Modify Configuration Files**
    * **Attack Vector: Modify Configuration Files**
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: High
        * Description: Attackers gain unauthorized access (often through other vulnerabilities) to modify configuration files managed by Flysystem, allowing them to alter application behavior, potentially leading to complete compromise.

* **HIGH RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Data into Files**
    * **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Data into Files**
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium
        * Description: Attackers upload or modify files with malicious data that is later processed by the application, leading to unexpected behavior, vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), or other injection attacks.
