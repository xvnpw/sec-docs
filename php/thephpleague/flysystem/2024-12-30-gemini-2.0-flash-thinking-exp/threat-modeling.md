*   **Threat:** Adapter-Specific Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**
        *   An attacker exploits a known vulnerability within a specific Flysystem adapter's underlying library or the storage service's API *through Flysystem's interaction*. This implies the vulnerability is triggered by how Flysystem uses the adapter.
        *   This could involve sending crafted requests or exploiting weaknesses in the adapter's handling of data *as initiated by Flysystem*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to stored files (read, list).
        *   Modification or deletion of files.
        *   Potential for further compromise of the storage backend or the application itself, depending on the vulnerability and Flysystem's role in triggering it.
    *   **Affected Flysystem Component:**
        *   Specific Adapter Modules (e.g., `AwsS3Adapter`, `FtpAdapter`, `Local`) and the core Flysystem interfaces that interact with them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all Flysystem adapter dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   Carefully review the changelogs and security advisories of adapter dependencies for vulnerabilities that could be triggered through Flysystem's usage.
        *   Consider implementing additional input validation or sanitization within the application before passing data to Flysystem, especially for adapter-specific configurations or operations.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Adapter Configuration Leading to Credential Exposure
    *   **Description:**
        *   An attacker gains access to sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.) used to configure Flysystem adapters *due to how the application manages and passes these configurations to Flysystem*. This focuses on the application's responsibility in handling credentials used by Flysystem.
        *   This could happen through insecure storage of credentials in the application's codebase or configuration files *that are then used to instantiate Flysystem adapters*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Full control over the storage backend associated with the compromised credentials.
        *   Ability to read, write, delete, and list any files within the storage *via Flysystem*.
        *   Potential for significant data breaches and service disruption.
    *   **Affected Flysystem Component:**
        *   Adapter Configuration (the process of passing configuration arrays or objects during adapter instantiation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store adapter credentials securely using environment variables, dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or secure configuration providers *and ensure the application securely retrieves and passes these to Flysystem*.
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in application code or configuration files *that are directly used by Flysystem*.
        *   Implement proper access controls and permissions for configuration files *that contain Flysystem adapter settings*.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via User-Controlled Input
    *   **Description:**
        *   An attacker manipulates user-provided input (e.g., filenames, directory names) that is used to construct file paths passed to *Flysystem operations*.
        *   By including path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`), the attacker can access or manipulate files outside of the intended directory *through Flysystem's file system abstraction*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the storage backend *via Flysystem's read operations*.
        *   Overwriting or deleting critical files *using Flysystem's write or delete operations*.
        *   Potential for executing arbitrary code if the storage backend allows it (less common with cloud storage, more relevant for local filesystem accessed via Flysystem).
    *   **Affected Flysystem Component:**
        *   Functions that accept file paths as arguments (e.g., `read()`, `write()`, `delete()`, `copy()`, `move()`).
        *   Path resolution logic within Flysystem itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly use user-provided input to construct file paths passed to Flysystem.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape path traversal sequences *before passing them to Flysystem functions*.
        *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed file paths or patterns *that are then used with Flysystem*.
        *   Utilize Flysystem's path manipulation functions (e.g., `dirname()`, `basename()`) carefully and avoid manual string concatenation for path construction *when working with Flysystem*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Permissions on Underlying Storage
    *   **Description:**
        *   The underlying storage backend (e.g., AWS S3 bucket, local filesystem) has overly permissive default permissions *that are then exploited through Flysystem's operations*. This highlights how Flysystem's actions are affected by the underlying permissions.
        *   Even if Flysystem is used correctly in terms of path handling, these permissions can allow unauthorized access to files *when accessed via Flysystem*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Public exposure of sensitive files *accessible through Flysystem*.
        *   Unauthorized modification or deletion of files by unintended parties *using Flysystem*.
    *   **Affected Flysystem Component:**
        *   While Flysystem doesn't directly *manage* these permissions, its read, write, and delete operations are directly affected by them.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the underlying storage backend with the principle of least privilege.
        *   Review and adjust default permissions for newly created files and directories.
        *   Utilize adapter-specific options (if available) to set appropriate permissions during file creation *when using Flysystem to create files*.
        *   Regularly audit storage permissions.
