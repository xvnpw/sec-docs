## Attack Surface: [I. Path Traversal via Filename Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/i__path_traversal_via_filename_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths provided to Flysystem functions to access or modify files outside the intended storage directory.
*   **How Flysystem Contributes:** Flysystem's file operation functions (e.g., `read()`, `write()`, `delete()`) directly process the provided file paths. If the application passes unsanitized user input to these functions, Flysystem will attempt to operate on the attacker-controlled path.
*   **Example:** A user providing a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd` in a file read operation, and the application using `$filesystem->read($_GET['filename'])` without sanitization, potentially allowing access to sensitive system files if the underlying adapter permits.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for remote code execution (if writable paths are targeted), data deletion or modification.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided filenames and paths *before* using them with Flysystem.
    *   **Path Normalization:** Utilize Flysystem's path manipulation functions (e.g., `dirname()`, `basename()`) to ensure paths stay within the intended storage directory.
    *   **Avoid Direct Concatenation:**  Never directly concatenate user input into file paths passed to Flysystem.
    *   **Restrict Adapter Access:** Configure the underlying storage adapter to limit the accessible file system paths if possible.
