# Threat Model Analysis for thephpleague/flysystem

## Threat: [Path Traversal via User-Controlled Filenames/Paths](./threats/path_traversal_via_user-controlled_filenamespaths.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input (e.g., filenames, paths) used directly in Flysystem operations (like `read()`, `write()`, `delete()`) if Flysystem doesn't sufficiently sanitize or validate these inputs. This could allow access or modification of files outside the intended directory. For example, using "../" sequences in filenames passed to Flysystem functions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files managed by Flysystem, overwriting critical files within the storage system, deletion of important data managed by Flysystem.

**Affected Component:** Flysystem's core API functions that handle file paths (e.g., `read()`, `write()`, `delete()`, `copy()`, `move()`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the application sanitizes and validates all user-provided input *before* passing it to Flysystem's file path handling functions.
* Utilize Flysystem's path manipulation functions carefully and understand their security implications.
* Consider using a whitelisting approach for allowed paths or filename patterns.

## Threat: [Adapter-Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/adapter-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist within the code of specific Flysystem adapters (e.g., the AWS S3 adapter, the FTP adapter). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass Flysystem's abstraction and directly interact with the underlying storage in an unauthorized manner, potentially leveraging flaws in how the adapter interacts with the storage service's API.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to complete compromise of the underlying storage system accessed through the vulnerable adapter.

**Affected Component:** The specific Flysystem adapter being used (e.g., `League\Flysystem\AwsS3V3\AwsS3Adapter`, `League\Flysystem\Ftp\FtpAdapter`).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Flysystem and all its dependencies, including the specific adapters being used, updated to the latest stable versions.
* Monitor security advisories specifically for Flysystem and its adapters.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication with Storage Services](./threats/insecure_communication_with_storage_services.md)

**Description:** If a Flysystem adapter is not configured to use secure communication protocols (e.g., using plain FTP instead of SFTP, or HTTP instead of HTTPS for cloud storage), an attacker could intercept sensitive data in transit between the application and the storage service. This could include file contents or even authentication credentials used by the adapter.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data stored or being transferred, potential compromise of storage service credentials if intercepted.

**Affected Component:** The specific Flysystem adapter and its configuration related to establishing connections with the storage service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the chosen Flysystem adapters are configured to use secure communication protocols (e.g., SFTP, HTTPS).
* Verify the TLS/SSL configuration for HTTPS connections used by the adapter.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Flysystem's Direct Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_flysystem's_direct_dependencies.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist in the libraries that Flysystem directly depends on. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are present in the versions used by the application, potentially leading to various security issues within the Flysystem library itself or the application's interaction with it.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution within the application's context when using Flysystem.

**Affected Component:** Flysystem library and its direct dependencies as defined in its `composer.json` file.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Flysystem and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions using a dependency manager like Composer.
* Use security scanning tools that analyze project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
