## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal Vulnerability (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_vulnerability__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Goal: Access files outside intended directories.
    *   Method: Manipulate file paths passed to Flysystem functions (e.g., `read`, `write`, `delete`) using ".." sequences or absolute paths.
    *   Example: `$filesystem->read('../../../etc/passwd');`
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all file paths provided by users or external sources before passing them to Flysystem. Use Flysystem's path normalization features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass in Adapter (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass_in_adapter__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Goal: Access storage without proper authentication.
    *   Method: Exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the specific adapter being used (e.g., default credentials, insecure API keys, flaws in OAuth implementation).
    *   Example: Using default credentials for an S3 bucket adapter if not changed.
    *   Actionable Insight: Ensure strong and unique credentials are used for all adapters. Follow the security best practices recommended by the adapter provider. Regularly review and rotate credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [API Exploitation of Underlying Storage (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/api_exploitation_of_underlying_storage__critical_node_.md)

*   Goal: Directly interact with the underlying storage bypassing intended access controls.
    *   Method: If the adapter exposes configuration options that allow direct interaction with the underlying storage API (e.g., providing AWS SDK credentials), an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in that API if not configured securely.
    *   Example: Using exposed AWS credentials to directly access and manipulate S3 buckets.
    *   Actionable Insight: Minimize the exposure of direct API access credentials. Implement the principle of least privilege for adapter configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Credentials in Configuration (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_credentials_in_configuration__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Goal: Obtain credentials to access the storage backend.
    *   Method: Discover credentials stored insecurely in configuration files, environment variables, or code.
    *   Example: Finding AWS keys hardcoded in a configuration file used by the S3 adapter.
    *   Actionable Insight: Store credentials securely using environment variables, dedicated secrets management solutions, or secure configuration providers. Avoid hardcoding credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Permissions/Access Control Configuration (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_permissionsaccess_control_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Goal: Gain access to files due to overly permissive configurations.
    *   Method: Exploit misconfigured access controls within Flysystem or the underlying storage system, allowing unauthorized users to read, write, or delete files.
    *   Example: Configuring an adapter with overly broad permissions on a cloud storage bucket.
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring adapters and storage permissions. Regularly review and audit access control settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Input Validation on File Paths (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_input_validation_on_file_paths__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Goal: Manipulate file operations by providing malicious file paths.
    *   Method: The application does not properly validate user-provided file paths before using them with Flysystem, allowing path traversal or other manipulations.
    *   Example: A user providing a path like `../../sensitive_data.txt` in a file download request.
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all file paths received from users or external sources before using them with Flysystem.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Handling After Flysystem Operations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_handling_after_flysystem_operations__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Goal: Compromise data after it's retrieved by Flysystem.
    *   Method: Even if Flysystem retrieves the correct file, the application might handle it insecurely afterwards (e.g., storing it in a publicly accessible location, displaying it without proper sanitization).
    *   Example: Downloading a file using Flysystem and then saving it to a publicly accessible web directory.
    *   Actionable Insight: Ensure secure handling of files after they are retrieved by Flysystem. Follow secure coding practices for file storage and display.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Authorization Checks Before Flysystem Operations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_authorization_checks_before_flysystem_operations__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Goal: Access files without proper authorization within the application.
    *   Method: The application uses Flysystem to access files without verifying if the current user has the necessary permissions to access those files within the application's context.
    *   Example: Allowing any logged-in user to download any file managed by Flysystem without specific authorization checks.
    *   Actionable Insight: Implement robust authorization checks within the application logic before performing any file operations using Flysystem.
