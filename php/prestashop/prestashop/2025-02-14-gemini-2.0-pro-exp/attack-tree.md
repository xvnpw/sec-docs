```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Object Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1__object_injection.md)

*   **1a. Unsafe Deserialization (High Risk):**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium. PrestaShop's reliance on PHP and potential use of older code or third-party libraries increases the risk of deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Very High. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), granting the attacker full control over the server.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High. Requires understanding of PHP object serialization and identifying exploitable "gadget chains" within the codebase.
    *   **Skill Level:** High. Requires in-depth knowledge of PHP internals, object-oriented programming, and exploit development techniques.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High. Often requires manual code auditing and dynamic analysis using specialized tools. Standard web vulnerability scanners may miss subtle deserialization flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Modules/Themes (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_modulesthemes__critical_node_.md)

*   ***4. Module RCE (Remote Code Execution) (Critical Node, High Risk):*** This is a critical node because compromising a module can often lead to full system compromise.
    *   **4a. Unsafe File Upload in Back-Office (Module) (High Risk):**
        *   **Likelihood:** High. Third-party modules are a frequent source of vulnerabilities due to varying code quality and security practices. File upload functionality is a common feature in modules, increasing the attack surface.
        *   **Impact:** Very High. RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data theft, and potential lateral movement within the network.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium. Finding a vulnerable module and crafting an exploit can be relatively straightforward, especially if the module is poorly coded or uses outdated libraries. Publicly available exploits may exist for known vulnerable modules.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of file upload vulnerabilities, basic PHP scripting, and potentially knowledge of common web server configurations.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High. Detection depends on the module's logging capabilities and the sophistication of the attacker.  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can help, but may be bypassed.

    *   **4b. Lack of Input Validation in Back-Office (Module) (High Risk):**
        *   **Likelihood:** High. Modules often introduce new input fields and processing logic that may not be as thoroughly vetted as the core PrestaShop code.  Developers of modules may have varying levels of security expertise.
        *   **Impact:** Very High.  Lack of input validation can lead to various injection attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and, crucially, code injection (RCE).
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Finding a vulnerable input field in a module often involves testing various input types and looking for error messages or unexpected behavior.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of common web application vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, command injection) and how to exploit them.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Can be detected through penetration testing, code review, and dynamic analysis tools.  However, complex or obfuscated code can make detection more challenging.
