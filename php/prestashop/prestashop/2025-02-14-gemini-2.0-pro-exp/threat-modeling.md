# Threat Model Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Module Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_module_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in a third-party PrestaShop module (e.g., a payment gateway, shipping module, or marketing tool). The attacker leverages a flaw *within the module's code* to inject malicious code, gain unauthorized access to data, or manipulate the store's functionality. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability exists within code specifically written for PrestaShop.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breach (customer PII, order details, payment information).
    *   Website defacement.
    *   Installation of malware (e.g., credit card skimmers).
    *   Complete store takeover.
    *   Financial loss (fraudulent transactions).
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Affected PrestaShop Component:**  Third-party modules (installed from the PrestaShop Addons marketplace or other sources). Specific vulnerable functions within the module's code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the module's functionality and the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Module Vetting:** Thoroughly research modules before installation. Check developer reputation, reviews, update history, and security track record.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Implement a strict policy to update *all* modules immediately upon release of security patches. Automate this process if possible.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Only install modules that are absolutely necessary. Uninstall unused modules.
    *   **Code Review (Advanced):** For critical modules, consider a code review or security audit.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Monitor for unauthorized changes to module files.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD) for PrestaShop and installed modules.

## Threat: [Unpatched PrestaShop Core Vulnerability](./threats/unpatched_prestashop_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability *within the core PrestaShop software itself*. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability exists in PrestaShop's own codebase. The attacker might use publicly available exploit code or develop their own, targeting flaws in PrestaShop's core functions, database interaction, or other components.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete store compromise.
    *   Data breach (customer data, order details, potentially payment information if stored insecurely).
    *   Website defacement.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Loss of control over the store.
*   **Affected PrestaShop Component:** Core PrestaShop files and functions (e.g., `classes/`, `controllers/`, `config/`). Specific vulnerable components will vary depending on the exploit.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Updates:** Update PrestaShop to the latest stable release *immediately* upon release of security patches.
    *   **Staging Environment:** Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.
    *   **1-Click Upgrade (with Caution):** Use the 1-Click Upgrade module, but *always* create a full backup before upgrading.
    *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor the official PrestaShop security advisories and blog.

## Threat: [Malicious Module Installation](./threats/malicious_module_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a *maliciously crafted module* to the PrestaShop store. This module is designed specifically to exploit PrestaShop or its environment. The attacker might try to get it listed on the official Addons marketplace (rare, but possible) or trick an administrator into installing it from an untrusted source. The malicious code is directly targeted at PrestaShop.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete store compromise.
    *   Data breach.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Website defacement.
    *   Financial loss.
*   **Affected PrestaShop Component:** Module installation process, and potentially any part of the system depending on the malicious module's code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Sources Only:** Install modules *only* from the official PrestaShop Addons marketplace or from highly reputable developers.
    *   **Vetting:** Carefully vet modules before installation, even from the official marketplace. Check reviews, developer reputation, and update frequency.
    *   **Code Review (Advanced):** For critical modules, consider a code review or security audit before installation.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Monitor for unauthorized changes to module files.

## Threat: [Improper Override Implementation (Leading to Vulnerability)](./threats/improper_override_implementation__leading_to_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** A developer incorrectly implements overrides for core PrestaShop functionality, *introducing a new security vulnerability* in the process. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability is created within the PrestaShop override system, a core part of the platform. The incorrect override might expose sensitive data, bypass security checks, or allow for code injection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Introduction of *new* vulnerabilities specific to the custom override.
    *   Potential for data breaches, unauthorized access, or code execution.
    *   Instability and conflicts with other parts of the system.
*   **Affected PrestaShop Component:** The PrestaShop override system (`override/` directory), specific core classes and controllers being overridden, and the *incorrectly implemented override code itself*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Follow PrestaShop Guidelines:** Strictly adhere to PrestaShop's documentation on using the override system. Never modify core files directly.
    *   **Document Overrides:** Thoroughly document all overrides, including their purpose and the files they affect.
    *   **Test Thoroughly:** Test all overrides extensively in a staging environment before deploying to production, *specifically including security testing*.
    *   **Minimize Overrides:** Keep the number of overrides to a minimum.
    *   **Code Review:** Review override code *specifically for security vulnerabilities* and best practices.
