# BUSINESS POSTURE

PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. The business priorities revolve around providing a stable, secure, and feature-rich platform for merchants to build and manage their online stores. The project aims to be accessible to a wide range of users, from small businesses to larger enterprises.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a user-friendly and customizable e-commerce platform.
*   Enable merchants to manage products, orders, customers, and payments efficiently.
*   Offer a wide range of features and modules to extend functionality.
*   Maintain a secure and reliable platform to protect merchant and customer data.
*   Foster a strong community of developers and users.
*   Ensure scalability to accommodate growing businesses.

Business Goals:

*   Increase the number of active PrestaShop stores.
*   Expand the PrestaShop ecosystem with new modules and themes.
*   Improve the platform's performance and security.
*   Enhance the user experience for both merchants and customers.
*   Maintain a high level of community engagement.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security breaches leading to data theft or financial loss.
*   Platform instability or downtime causing disruption to merchant operations.
*   Lack of features or customization options limiting merchant capabilities.
*   Poor performance impacting customer experience and sales.
*   Competition from other e-commerce platforms.
*   Negative community sentiment or lack of developer support.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection. Implemented in core code and modules.
*   security control: Password hashing using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt). Implemented in the user authentication system.
*   security control: Protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Implemented using tokens.
*   security control: Regular security updates and patches to address vulnerabilities. Provided through the PrestaShop update mechanism.
*   security control: Secure development guidelines and best practices. Documented and promoted to developers.
*   security control: Access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality. Implemented in the back-office user roles and permissions system.
*   security control: Use of prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Implemented in database interactions.
*   security control: Option to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) encryption. Configurable in the back-office settings.
*   security control: File upload restrictions to prevent malicious file uploads. Implemented in file upload handling.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party modules and themes, which may introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by users, leading to security weaknesses.
*   accepted risk: Dependence on the security of the underlying server environment (e.g., PHP, MySQL).

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
*   Introduce a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
*   Implement regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Provide two-factor authentication (2FA) for back-office users.
*   Implement a strong session management system with secure cookies.
*   Introduce a file integrity monitoring system to detect unauthorized changes.
*   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   Provide security hardening guides for server configuration.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies (length, complexity, expiration).
    *   Secure password storage using strong hashing algorithms.
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
    *   Two-factor authentication (recommended).
    *   Secure session management.

*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) for back-office users.
    *   Fine-grained permissions to control access to specific resources and actions.
    *   Secure handling of API keys and access tokens.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other injection attacks.
    *   Validation of data types, lengths, and formats.

    A[Developer]
    B[Git Repository]
    C[CI/CD Pipeline]
    D[Code Analysis Tools]
    E[Container Registry]
    F[Artifacts]

```

Build Process:

1.  Developers commit code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  The CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by the commit.
3.  The pipeline runs automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
4.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., SonarQube) are used to analyze the code for security vulnerabilities.
5.  Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools are used to identify and manage open-source dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
6.  A Docker image is built containing the PrestaShop application and its dependencies.
7.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).
8.  Build artifacts, such as installation packages, are published.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Automated testing to identify bugs and vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   security control: SAST to detect security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: SCA to manage open-source dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Secure build environment to prevent tampering with the build process.
