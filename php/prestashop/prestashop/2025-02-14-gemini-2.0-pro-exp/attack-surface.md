# Attack Surface Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Modules](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_modules.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of security flaws in modules developed by third parties.
    *   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop's core architecture *relies* on a vast ecosystem of third-party modules for functionality.  This inherent reliance, combined with varying levels of developer security expertise and a marketplace that doesn't guarantee security, creates a *direct* and substantial attack surface.  The update mechanism, while present, is not always sufficient to ensure timely patching of all modules.
    *   **Example:** A module designed for payment processing contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access customer payment information.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (customer data, order details, payment information), complete site takeover, defacement, malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Conduct rigorous security audits (static and dynamic analysis) of *all* third-party modules before integration. Prioritize modules from reputable developers with a proven track record of security responsiveness. Implement secure coding practices within any custom modules or modifications.
        *   **Users:**  Minimize the number of installed modules to only those absolutely essential.  Choose modules from trusted sources (the official PrestaShop Addons marketplace *with careful scrutiny*, or reputable developers directly).  Maintain *all* modules at their latest versions.  Regularly review installed modules and remove any that are unused, outdated, or from untrusted sources.  Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules specifically designed to mitigate known module vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Themes](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_themes.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of security flaws in themes developed by third parties, often involving XSS or file inclusion.
    *   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop's theming system, while providing flexibility, allows for the inclusion of custom code (JavaScript, PHP) within themes. This *direct* allowance for third-party code within the presentation layer creates a significant attack surface if themes are not thoroughly vetted.
    *   **Example:** A theme includes a vulnerable JavaScript library that allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker injects malicious JavaScript, potentially stealing user cookies or redirecting users.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side attacks (XSS), session hijacking, phishing, defacement, potentially leading to further compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Audit theme code meticulously for vulnerabilities, paying close attention to JavaScript and any areas handling user input.  Utilize only up-to-date and secure JavaScript libraries.  Sanitize all data displayed within theme templates rigorously.
        *   **Users:**  Select themes exclusively from reputable sources.  Keep themes updated to their latest versions.  Avoid themes with excessive or unnecessary features.  If modifying a theme, adhere strictly to secure coding practices.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured PrestaShop Webservice (API)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_prestashop_webservice__api_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the PrestaShop API, allowing unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop *provides* a built-in API (Webservice) as a core component for external integrations. This *direct* provision of an API, without mandatory robust security configurations out-of-the-box, creates a significant attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers an improperly secured API endpoint that allows them to retrieve a list of all customers and their order history without proper authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (customer data, order details), unauthorized modification of store data, denial-of-service attacks against the API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement strong authentication and authorization for *all* API endpoints.  Employ secure methods for storing and managing API keys (never expose them in client-side code or publicly accessible files).  Validate *all* input received through the API rigorously.  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
        *   **Users:**  Regularly review and audit API keys, revoking any that are unused or potentially compromised.  Ensure that any modules or applications interacting with the API are themselves properly secured and follow best practices.  Monitor API usage for any suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Core PrestaShop Software](./attack_surfaces/outdated_core_prestashop_software.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of the PrestaShop core software, which may contain known and publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
    *   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop, as the software provider, is *directly* responsible for releasing security updates.  The existence of outdated installations, vulnerable to known exploits, is a direct consequence of the platform's update cycle and the user's responsibility to apply them.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in an older version of PrestaShop's core, allowing for remote code execution. An attacker exploits this publicly known vulnerability to gain complete control of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete site takeover, data breaches, defacement, malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide clear, user-friendly, and reliable update mechanisms.  Clearly communicate the security implications of each update.  Consider more aggressive update reminders or even forced updates for critical security patches.
        *   **Users:**  Maintain PrestaShop at its *latest* stable version.  Enable automatic updates if possible (and actively monitor for any update failures).  Subscribe to PrestaShop's official security advisories to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and available patches.
