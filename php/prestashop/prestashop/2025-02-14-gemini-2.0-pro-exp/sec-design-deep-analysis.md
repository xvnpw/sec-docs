### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

**2.1 Web Application (PrestaShop Core)**

*   **Authentication:**
    *   **Threats:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking, phishing.
    *   **Existing Controls:** Password hashing (bcrypt), CSRF protection.
    *   **Inferred Vulnerabilities:**  Potential weaknesses in session management (e.g., predictable session IDs, lack of HTTP-only and secure flags on cookies).  Lack of 2FA by default.  Potential for insufficient password complexity enforcement.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Mandatory 2FA:**  Enforce 2FA for all back-office users, ideally with options for TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) or WebAuthn.
        *   **Session Security:**  Ensure all session cookies have the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set.  Use a cryptographically secure random number generator for session IDs.  Implement session expiration and idle timeouts.  Consider session fixation protection mechanisms.
        *   **Password Policy:**  Enforce a strong password policy (minimum length, complexity, and regular changes).  Consider using a password strength meter.  Prevent reuse of previous passwords.
        *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts, with a time-based delay before unlocking.  Log all failed login attempts.
        *   **CAPTCHA:** Implement CAPTCHA on login and registration pages to mitigate automated attacks.

*   **Authorization:**
    *   **Threats:**  Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **Existing Controls:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the back-office.
    *   **Inferred Vulnerabilities:**  Potential for insufficient granularity in permissions.  Risk of misconfigured roles leading to excessive privileges.  Lack of auditing of permission changes.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Review and refine RBAC roles to ensure users have only the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid overly permissive default roles.
        *   **Permission Auditing:**  Implement logging of all changes to user roles and permissions.  Regularly review user permissions to identify and correct any misconfigurations.
        *   **API Security:** If PrestaShop exposes APIs, ensure proper authentication and authorization for API access, using API keys or OAuth 2.0.  Implement rate limiting on API calls.
