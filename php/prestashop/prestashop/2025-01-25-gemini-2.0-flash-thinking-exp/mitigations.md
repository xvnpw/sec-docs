# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update PrestaShop Core](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_prestashop_core.md)

### Description:
*   **Step 1:** Monitor the official PrestaShop project on GitHub ([https://github.com/prestashop/prestashop](https://github.com/prestashop/prestashop)) and the PrestaShop official website for announcements of new releases and security patches. Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow PrestaShop's social media channels for timely updates.
*   **Step 2:** Before applying updates to your live PrestaShop store, create a staging environment that is a replica of your production setup. This staging environment should use the same PrestaShop version, modules, theme, and data (anonymized if necessary for privacy).
*   **Step 3:** Utilize PrestaShop's built-in "1-Click Upgrade" module (available in the back office) or follow the manual upgrade instructions provided in the official PrestaShop documentation. Apply the update to your staging environment first.
*   **Step 4:** After upgrading the staging environment, thoroughly test all critical functionalities of your PrestaShop store. This includes browsing products, adding to cart, checkout process, payment gateway integrations, user account management, and back office administration features. Pay special attention to any custom modules or theme customizations for compatibility issues.
*   **Step 5:** If the update is successful in the staging environment and no critical issues are found, schedule a maintenance window for your production PrestaShop store.
*   **Step 6:** Before initiating the update on the production store, create a full backup of your PrestaShop database and files. This backup is essential for rollback in case of unforeseen problems during the update process.
*   **Step 7:** Apply the update to your production PrestaShop store using the same method as in the staging environment (1-Click Upgrade or manual upgrade).
*   **Step 8:** After updating the production store, perform basic functional checks to ensure the store is online and key features are working as expected. Monitor server logs and PrestaShop error logs for any immediate issues.

### Impact:
*   Exploitation of Known PrestaShop Core Vulnerabilities: High reduction - Directly addresses and patches vulnerabilities identified and fixed by the PrestaShop development team in the core software.
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) in PrestaShop Core: High reduction - Updates often include critical patches for RCE vulnerabilities, preventing attackers from gaining control of the PrestaShop server through core exploits.
*   SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in PrestaShop Core: Medium to High reduction - Core updates may contain fixes for SQL injection flaws, depending on the nature of the update and reported vulnerabilities.
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in PrestaShop Core: Medium reduction - Core updates can patch XSS vulnerabilities present in the PrestaShop core code, improving overall security.
*   Data Breaches due to Core Vulnerabilities: Medium to High reduction - By resolving core vulnerabilities, updates reduce the likelihood of data breaches stemming from exploits in the PrestaShop core.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks exploiting Core weaknesses: Low to Medium reduction - Some updates may address performance bottlenecks or vulnerabilities in the core that could be leveraged for DoS attacks.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially Implemented - The project likely has some awareness of updates, but a consistent, rigorously tested, and documented update process specifically for PrestaShop core might be lacking. Back office update notifications are likely enabled.

### Missing Implementation:
Establish a formal, documented PrestaShop core update process that mandates staging environment testing, pre-update backups, and a rollback plan. Implement a regular schedule for checking for and applying PrestaShop core updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Remove Unnecessary Default PrestaShop Modules](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_remove_unnecessary_default_prestashop_modules.md)

### Description:
*   **Step 1:** Access the PrestaShop back office administration panel.
*   **Step 2:** Navigate to the "Modules" section, typically found in the left-hand menu under "Modules" -> "Module Manager".
*   **Step 3:** Review the list of "Installed modules". Focus on modules that are part of the default PrestaShop installation (often listed under categories like "PrestaShop Native modules" or similar). Identify modules that are not actively used by your store and are not essential for your required functionalities. Consider modules related to features you don't utilize, such as specific payment methods, shipping carriers, or marketing tools if you rely on external services instead.
*   **Step 4:** For each identified unnecessary default module, initially attempt to "Disable" it. Locate the module in the list and use the "Disable" action (usually found in a dropdown menu or action button associated with the module). Disabling keeps the module installed but inactive, allowing for easy re-enabling if needed.
*   **Step 5:** After disabling modules, thoroughly test your PrestaShop store's front-end and back-end functionalities to ensure disabling these modules has not inadvertently broken any features you are using.
*   **Step 6:** If you are confident that a disabled module will not be required in the future and disabling it has no adverse effects, consider completely "Uninstalling" it. Find the disabled module in the module list and use the "Uninstall" action (typically in the same action menu as "Disable"). Uninstalling removes the module's files and database entries, further reducing the attack surface.
*   **Step 7:** After uninstalling modules, re-test your store to confirm no issues have arisen from the uninstallation process.
*   **Step 8:** Repeat steps 3-7 for all identified unnecessary default PrestaShop modules.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Default PrestaShop Modules - Severity: Medium
*   Increased Attack Surface due to Unnecessary PrestaShop Code - Severity: Medium
*   Maintenance Overhead for Unused PrestaShop Components - Severity: Low

### Impact:
*   Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Unused Default PrestaShop Modules: Medium reduction - Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in default PrestaShop modules that are not actively contributing to your store's functionality.
*   Increased Attack Surface due to Unnecessary PrestaShop Code: Medium reduction - Decreases the overall attack surface by removing potentially vulnerable code that is not required for your PrestaShop store to operate.
*   Maintenance Overhead for Unused PrestaShop Components: Low reduction - Simplifies module management and reduces the number of PrestaShop components that need to be monitored for updates and security issues.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially Implemented - Some obviously unused default modules might be disabled, but a systematic review and removal of all non-essential default PrestaShop modules is likely not a standard practice.

### Missing Implementation:
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all default PrestaShop modules to identify and disable/uninstall those that are not essential for the store's operation. This should be a part of the initial PrestaShop setup and periodically reviewed as store requirements evolve.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure PrestaShop Back Office Access (Specific to PrestaShop)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_prestashop_back_office_access__specific_to_prestashop_.md)

### Description:
*   **Change the default PrestaShop back office folder name:**
    *   Step 1: Access your PrestaShop installation directory on the server using FTP, SSH, or your hosting control panel's file manager.
    *   Step 2: Locate the default back office folder. By default, it is named "admin" or "administration" (the exact name might vary slightly depending on the PrestaShop version and installation process).
    *   Step 3: Rename this folder to a unique, less predictable name. Avoid easily guessable names like "admin-panel" or "backend". Use a more obscure name, for example, "secure-store-management" or a randomly generated string.
    *   Step 4: After renaming the folder, you might need to update PrestaShop's configuration to reflect this change. In most cases, PrestaShop automatically detects the renamed folder. However, if you encounter issues accessing the back office after renaming, you might need to manually adjust the `_PS_ADMIN_DIR_` constant in the `config/defines.inc.php` file to match the new folder name.
*   **Implement PrestaShop Back Office IP Address Whitelisting (using server configuration):**
    *   Step 1: Identify the static IP addresses or IP ranges of your development team, administrators, and any other authorized personnel who require access to the PrestaShop back office.
    *   Step 2: Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to restrict access to the renamed PrestaShop back office directory. This is typically achieved by modifying the web server's configuration files (e.g., `.htaccess` for Apache or server block configuration for Nginx) to only allow requests to the back office directory from the whitelisted IP addresses.
*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies for PrestaShop Back Office Users (within PrestaShop):**
    *   Step 1: Log in to the PrestaShop back office.
    *   Step 2: Navigate to "Advanced Parameters" -> "Administration" -> "Preferences".
    *   Step 3: Configure the password policy settings available in PrestaShop. This typically includes options to enforce minimum password length, require a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and potentially set password expiration periods.
    *   Step 4: Educate all PrestaShop back office users about the importance of creating and maintaining strong, unique passwords and following secure password management practices.
    *   Step 5: Consider recommending or implementing a password manager for PrestaShop back office users to aid in generating and securely storing complex passwords.
*   **Regularly Review and Audit PrestaShop Back Office User Accounts (within PrestaShop):**
    *   Step 1: Periodically (e.g., monthly or quarterly) review the list of PrestaShop back office user accounts. This can be done in the back office under "Administration" -> "Employees".
    *   Step 2: Identify user accounts that are no longer necessary, such as accounts belonging to former employees, temporary contractors, or accounts created for testing purposes that are no longer in use.
    *   Step 3: Disable or delete these unnecessary PrestaShop user accounts. For accounts of former employees, disable them immediately upon their departure.
    *   Step 4: Review the access permissions and roles assigned to each active PrestaShop user account. Ensure that users are granted only the minimum necessary permissions required for their job functions, following the principle of least privilege.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Brute-Force Attacks Targeting PrestaShop Back Office Login - Severity: High
*   Unauthorized Access to PrestaShop Back Office - Severity: High
*   Credential Stuffing Attacks against PrestaShop Admin Accounts - Severity: High
*   Privilege Escalation within PrestaShop Back Office - Severity: Medium

### Impact:
*   Brute-Force Attacks Targeting PrestaShop Back Office Login: High reduction - Renaming the admin folder and IP whitelisting significantly hinders automated brute-force attacks. Strong password policies further increase resistance to password guessing.
*   Unauthorized Access to PrestaShop Back Office: High reduction - IP whitelisting and strong passwords drastically reduce the risk of unauthorized individuals gaining access to the sensitive back office.
*   Credential Stuffing Attacks against PrestaShop Admin Accounts: Medium to High reduction - Strong password policies make it significantly more difficult for attackers to successfully use stolen credentials from other breaches to access PrestaShop admin accounts.
*   Privilege Escalation within PrestaShop Back Office: Medium reduction - Regular user account audits and permission reviews help prevent unauthorized privilege escalation by ensuring users only have the appropriate level of access within PrestaShop.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially Implemented - Strong password policies within PrestaShop might be configured. Renaming the admin folder and IP whitelisting at the server level are less likely to be implemented by default. Regular PrestaShop user account audits are probably not consistently performed.

### Missing Implementation:
Renaming the default PrestaShop admin folder, implementing IP whitelisting for back office access at the web server level, and establishing a routine schedule for reviewing and auditing PrestaShop back office user accounts and their permissions. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for PrestaShop back office logins is also a highly recommended missing security measure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden PrestaShop Configuration Files (Specific to PrestaShop)](./mitigation_strategies/harden_prestashop_configuration_files__specific_to_prestashop_.md)

### Description:
*   **Restrict Access to Sensitive PrestaShop Configuration Files (server-level configuration):**
    *   Step 1: Access your PrestaShop installation files on the server.
    *   Step 2: Locate the primary PrestaShop configuration files, particularly `config/defines.inc.php` and `config/settings.inc.php`. These files contain sensitive information such as database credentials and encryption keys.
    *   Step 3: Set restrictive file permissions for these configuration files using server commands or your hosting control panel's file manager. Permissions should be set so that only the web server user (the user under which PrestaShop and your web server processes run) can read these files, and no other users or the public can access them. Recommended permissions are `640` or `600`.
    *   Step 4: Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to explicitly deny direct web access to these configuration files. This prevents anyone from directly requesting these files via a web browser. This can be done using `.htaccess` files for Apache or within the server block configuration for Nginx.
*   **Secure PrestaShop Database Credentials (within PrestaShop configuration):**
    *   Step 1: During the PrestaShop installation process or when modifying database settings, ensure you generate strong, unique passwords for the PrestaShop database user.
    *   Step 2: Verify that these strong database credentials are correctly configured within the PrestaShop configuration files, specifically in `config/defines.inc.php`.
    *   Step 3: Avoid using default database credentials or reusing passwords that are used for other systems or services.
    *   Step 4: For enhanced security, consider using environment variables to store PrestaShop database credentials instead of hardcoding them directly in the `config/defines.inc.php` file. This is especially beneficial in development and deployment pipelines and can be configured within PrestaShop's environment settings if supported by your hosting environment.
*   **Disable PrestaShop Debug Mode in Production (within PrestaShop configuration):**
    *   Step 1: Log in to the PrestaShop back office.
    *   Step 2: Navigate to "Advanced Parameters" -> "Performance".
    *   Step 3: Ensure that the "Debug mode" setting is set to "No" or "Never" for your production PrestaShop environment. Debug mode should only be enabled temporarily in staging or development environments for troubleshooting.
    *   Step 4: Double-check that the `_PS_MODE_DEV_` constant in the `config/defines.inc.php` file is explicitly set to `false` in your production environment configuration.
    *   Step 5: Regularly verify that debug mode remains disabled in production, as accidentally enabling it can expose sensitive information and negatively impact performance.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Information Disclosure from PrestaShop Configuration Files - Severity: Medium to High
*   Remote Code Execution via Configuration File Modification (less direct, but potential) - Severity: High
*   PrestaShop Database Compromise due to Exposed Credentials - Severity: High
*   Exposure of Sensitive PrestaShop Data (API keys, encryption keys, etc.) - Severity: High

### Impact:
*   Information Disclosure from PrestaShop Configuration Files: High reduction - Restricting access and preventing web access to configuration files effectively prevents attackers from directly reading sensitive information.
*   Remote Code Execution via Configuration File Modification: High reduction - Prevents attackers from directly modifying configuration files to inject malicious code or alter critical settings.
*   PrestaShop Database Compromise due to Exposed Credentials: High reduction - Securing database credentials and preventing their exposure significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized database access and compromise.
*   Exposure of Sensitive PrestaShop Data: High reduction - Minimizes the risk of exposing sensitive data stored in configuration files, such as API keys, encryption keys, and other confidential settings.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially Implemented - PrestaShop debug mode is likely disabled in production environments. However, restrictive file permissions on configuration files and web server configurations to deny direct access are less likely to be implemented by default and require manual hardening.

### Missing Implementation:
Verifying and enforcing restrictive file permissions on key PrestaShop configuration files, configuring the web server to explicitly deny direct web access to these files, and exploring the use of environment variables for managing sensitive PrestaShop configuration data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in PrestaShop](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__in_prestashop.md)

### Description:
*   Step 1: Define a Content Security Policy (CSP) tailored to your PrestaShop store's specific resource needs. Start with a restrictive policy and progressively refine it as necessary. A basic CSP for PrestaShop might include directives like:
    *   `default-src 'self';` (Restrict resource loading to the same origin by default)
    *   `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://trusted-cdn.com;` (Allow scripts from the same origin, inline scripts, `eval()`, and trusted CDNs - carefully consider the use of `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`)
    *   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://trusted-cdn.com;` (Allow styles from the same origin, inline styles, and trusted CDNs - carefully consider `'unsafe-inline'`)
    *   `img-src 'self' data: https://trusted-image-sources.com;` (Allow images from the same origin, data URLs, and trusted image sources)
    *   `font-src 'self' https://trusted-font-sources.com;` (Allow fonts from the same origin and trusted font sources)
    *   `connect-src 'self' https://api.your-domain.com;` (Allow AJAX/Fetch requests to the same origin and your API domain)
*   Step 2: Implement the CSP by sending the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header from your PrestaShop application. This can be achieved in several ways within PrestaShop:
    *   **Web Server Configuration:** Configure your web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to add the `Content-Security-Policy` header to all responses served by your PrestaShop store. This is often the most efficient and recommended method.
    *   **PrestaShop Module:** Develop or use an existing PrestaShop module that is designed to add custom HTTP headers, including the CSP header.
    *   **PrestaShop Theme Modification:** Modify your PrestaShop theme's header template file (e.g., `header.tpl` or similar) to output the CSP header using PHP code.
*   Step 3: Initially, test your CSP in "report-only" mode. Set the header to `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` instead of `Content-Security-Policy`. Also, include the `report-uri` directive in your CSP to specify an endpoint where violation reports should be sent (e.g., `report-uri /csp-report-endpoint`). Analyze these reports to identify any legitimate resources that are being blocked by your CSP and adjust the policy accordingly. You'll need to create a script or service at the `report-uri` endpoint to receive and process these reports.
*   Step 4: Once you are satisfied with your CSP and have addressed all reported violations in report-only mode, switch to enforcing mode by using the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
*   Step 5: Regularly review and refine your PrestaShop CSP as your store's functionality, modules, theme, and external resource dependencies evolve. New modules or integrations might require adjustments to your CSP to maintain both security and functionality.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in PrestaShop - Severity: High
*   Clickjacking attacks targeting PrestaShop pages - Severity: Medium
*   Data Injection Attacks within PrestaShop context - Severity: Medium
*   MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities in PrestaShop - Severity: Low

### Impact:
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in PrestaShop: High reduction - CSP is a highly effective defense against many forms of XSS attacks by preventing browsers from executing malicious scripts injected into PrestaShop pages.
*   Clickjacking attacks targeting PrestaShop pages: Medium reduction - CSP's `frame-ancestors` directive can prevent clickjacking attempts by controlling which domains are allowed to embed your PrestaShop site in frames.
*   Data Injection Attacks within PrestaShop context: Medium reduction - CSP can help mitigate certain data injection attacks by limiting the sources from which scripts and other resources can be loaded within PrestaShop.
*   MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities in PrestaShop: Low reduction - CSP often includes the `X-Content-Type-Options` directive (though technically a separate header), which prevents MIME-sniffing vulnerabilities in browsers accessing your PrestaShop site.

### Currently Implemented:
Not Implemented - Content Security Policy is generally not implemented by default in standard PrestaShop installations.

### Missing Implementation:
Implementing a Content Security Policy for the PrestaShop store. This includes defining a suitable CSP, choosing an implementation method (web server config, module, or theme modification), testing in report-only mode, and then enforcing the policy in production. Regular review and updates of the CSP are also essential.
