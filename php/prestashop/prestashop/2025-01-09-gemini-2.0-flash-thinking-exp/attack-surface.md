# Attack Surface Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Modules (Addons)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_modules__addons_.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party or even official PrestaShop modules contain security vulnerabilities.
*   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** PrestaShop's architecture relies heavily on modules for extending functionality, creating a large attack surface if modules are poorly coded or outdated. The official marketplace doesn't guarantee complete security vetting for all modules.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable payment module allows an attacker to bypass payment verification and complete orders without paying.
*   **Impact:** Financial loss, data breach (customer payment information), reputation damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install modules from trusted sources (official PrestaShop Addons marketplace or reputable developers).
    *   Thoroughly research modules before installation, checking reviews and developer reputation.
    *   Regularly update PrestaShop core, modules, and themes to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Enable automatic updates where feasible and carefully review changelogs before updating.
    *   Implement a process for security testing of installed modules.
    *   Uninstall unused modules to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Smarty](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_smarty.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly sanitized data passed to the Smarty template engine can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** PrestaShop uses the Smarty template engine extensively for rendering its front-end and back-end. Vulnerabilities can arise when user-supplied data is directly used in template assignments without proper escaping.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious code into a product description field, which, when rendered by Smarty, executes arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, website defacement, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and validate user input before passing it to Smarty templates.
    *   Use Smarty's built-in security features and output escaping functions.
    *   Regularly review and audit template code for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
    *   Restrict the use of potentially dangerous Smarty functions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure PrestaShop Webservice API](./attack_surfaces/insecure_prestashop_webservice_api.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the PrestaShop Webservice API allow unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
*   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** PrestaShop provides a built-in Webservice API for external integrations. If not properly secured, this API can become a significant entry point for attackers.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a lack of proper authentication in the API to retrieve sensitive customer data or modify product prices.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, business logic manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
    *   Use secure API keys and manage them properly.
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Carefully validate all input received through the API.
    *   Regularly review API access logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Disable the Webservice API if it's not being used.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration and Installation](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_and_installation.md)

*   **Description:**  Weak default settings or vulnerabilities during the installation process can leave the application vulnerable.
*   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** PrestaShop's initial setup and configuration steps, if not followed securely, can introduce vulnerabilities. Leaving default credentials or failing to remove installation files are common issues.
*   **Example:** Attackers use default administrative credentials to gain access to the PrestaShop back office.
*   **Impact:** Full control of the store, data breach, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Change default administrative credentials immediately after installation.
    *   Remove or secure the installation directory after setup is complete.
    *   Configure strong database credentials and secure database access.
    *   Disable debug mode in production environments.
    *   Review and harden server configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads (via modules or features)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads__via_modules_or_features_.md)

*   **Description:**  Functionalities allowing file uploads without proper validation can enable attackers to upload malicious scripts.
*   **How PrestaShop Contributes:**  Modules or even core features (like theme customization or product image uploads) might not adequately sanitize uploaded files.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP backdoor through a vulnerable module's file upload functionality, gaining remote access to the server.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation and whitelisting for all file upload functionalities.
    *   Sanitize uploaded file names to prevent directory traversal attacks.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible.
    *   Regularly scan uploaded files for malware.
    *   Restrict file upload permissions to only necessary users and roles.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (PrestaShop Specific Queries)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities__prestashop_specific_queries_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in PrestaShop's database queries allow attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **How PrestaShop Contributes:**  Developers might write custom queries or modules that don't properly sanitize user input before including it in SQL statements.
*   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a product search query to extract sensitive customer data from the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, potential for full database compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before using it in database queries.
    *   Regularly review and audit database queries for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts.
