    * **Developer Action:** Ensure these settings are enabled and clearly communicated to administrators during account creation and password resets. Consider using a password strength meter on the admin profile page.
* **Enable Account Lockout After a Certain Number of Failed Login Attempts:**
    * **Technical Implementation:**
        * **Core Modification (Careful):**  Modify the authentication logic in the admin controller to track failed login attempts per IP address or username. Implement a lockout mechanism (e.g., temporary block for a few minutes, increasing with subsequent failures).
        * **Module Usage:** Explore existing PrestaShop security modules that offer this functionality (e.g., modules that track login attempts and block IPs).
    * **Developer Action:**  Thoroughly test the lockout mechanism to ensure it doesn't inadvertently lock out legitimate users. Provide clear error messages and instructions for unlocking accounts.
* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Administrator Accounts:**
    * **Technical Implementation:**
        * **Module Integration:**  Integrate a robust MFA module (e.g., using Google Authenticator, Authy, or hardware tokens). PrestaShop offers modules for this purpose.
        * **Custom Implementation (Advanced):** Develop a custom MFA solution using standard authentication protocols (e.g., TOTP).
    * **Developer Action:**  Provide clear documentation and user-friendly instructions for setting up and using MFA. Enforce MFA for all administrator accounts.
* **Consider Using CAPTCHA on the Login Page:**
    * **Technical Implementation:**
        * **Module Integration:** Utilize CAPTCHA modules available for PrestaShop (e.g., reCAPTCHA).
