# Threat Model Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Core Vulnerabilities](./threats/sql_injection_via_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Core Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits undiscovered SQL injection vulnerabilities within the PrestaShop core codebase. They craft malicious SQL queries through user-accessible parameters or internal processing flaws to directly interact with the database, bypassing normal application logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (customer details, orders, payment information), data manipulation (modifying prices, order statuses), or even complete database takeover leading to potential data deletion or the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core functionality related to database interaction and data handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update PrestaShop to the latest stable version, as updates often contain patches for discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow official PrestaShop security advisories and apply recommended patches promptly.
        *   Developers contributing to the core should adhere to secure coding practices, including using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization even on data handled internally by the core.
        *   Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools on the PrestaShop core codebase during development.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Core Vulnerabilities](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Core Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the PrestaShop core code allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could be through insecure file handling, deserialization flaws, or other code execution vulnerabilities within the core.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, allowing the attacker to control the web server, access sensitive files, install malware, and potentially pivot to other systems on the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core functionality related to file handling, data processing, or specific libraries used by the core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain an up-to-date PrestaShop version, as updates often patch RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to official PrestaShop security notifications and apply patches immediately.
        *   Implement strict server security measures, including proper file permissions and disabling unnecessary services.
        *   Developers contributing to the core should be vigilant about potential RCE vulnerabilities during code development and review.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Core Functionality](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_core_functionality.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Core Functionality
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the core rendering or data handling allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can occur when the core application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking (stealing user cookies), redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the website, or information theft from the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core functionality related to rendering web pages and handling user input (e.g., displaying product information, handling customer comments).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep PrestaShop updated to benefit from fixes for known XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Developers contributing to the core should implement proper output encoding/escaping techniques in template files and PHP code to neutralize malicious scripts.
        *   Be aware of context-sensitive encoding (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Core Functionality](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_core_functionality.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Core Functionality
    *   **Description:** The PrestaShop core application allows users to access resources (e.g., order details, customer profiles) by directly manipulating object identifiers in URLs or form parameters without proper authorization checks. An attacker can guess or enumerate these identifiers to access data belonging to other users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, including personal information, order history, and potentially payment details.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core functionality related to data retrieval and display (e.g., order management functions, customer account pages).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers should implement robust authorization checks within the core before granting access to resources.
        *   Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in URLs. Use unique, non-guessable identifiers or implement access control lists (ACLs).
        *   Regularly review and audit access control mechanisms within the core application.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Core Vulnerabilities](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Core Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the PrestaShop core allow an attacker with lower privileges (e.g., a registered customer) to perform actions that require higher privileges, potentially gaining administrative access or the ability to modify critical settings.
    *   **Impact:** Full store compromise, ability to modify critical settings, access sensitive data, install malicious modules, and potentially take over the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core functionality related to user authentication and authorization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep PrestaShop updated to patch privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
        *   Developers contributing to the core should implement robust role-based access control and thoroughly test authorization logic.
        *   Regularly audit user roles and permissions within the PrestaShop admin panel.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attack on Admin Panel](./threats/brute-force_attack_on_admin_panel.md)

*   **Threat:** Brute-Force Attack on Admin Panel
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess administrator credentials by repeatedly trying different username and password combinations on the PrestaShop admin login page.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the administrative backend, allowing attackers to control the entire store.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core admin login functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong password policies and enforce their use.
        *   Enable account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts.
        *   Consider using CAPTCHA on the login page.
        *   Restrict access to the admin panel by IP address.
