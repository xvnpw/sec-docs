## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Access (Critical Node): Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws (High-Risk Path): Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_access__critical_node__exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws__high-risk_path_8a794006.md)

Attackers attempt to log in using well-known default usernames (e.g., 'admin') and passwords (e.g., 'admin', 'password', '12345'). This is a very common and easily exploitable vulnerability if the default credentials are not changed during installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Access (Critical Node): Exploit Admin Panel Vulnerabilities (Critical Node): Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Admin Panel (Critical Node): Exploit vulnerabilities in file upload functionality](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_access__critical_node__exploit_admin_panel_vulnerabilities__critical_node__remot_6a0b80f6.md)

Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., PHP webshells) by bypassing weak or non-existent file type checks in admin panel features like theme upload, module installation, or media management. Successfully uploaded webshells allow arbitrary command execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Access (Critical Node): Exploit Admin Panel Vulnerabilities (Critical Node): Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Admin Panel (Critical Node): Exploit vulnerabilities in template rendering engines (Smarty)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_access__critical_node__exploit_admin_panel_vulnerabilities__critical_node__remot_8ad01371.md)

Attackers inject malicious code into Smarty template files or input fields that are processed by the Smarty engine. If not properly sanitized, this code can be executed server-side, leading to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Administrative Access (Critical Node): Exploit Admin Panel Vulnerabilities (Critical Node): Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Admin Panel (Critical Node): Exploit vulnerabilities in specific admin modules](./attack_tree_paths/gain_administrative_access__critical_node__exploit_admin_panel_vulnerabilities__critical_node__remot_8db1c092.md)

Attackers target specific, potentially vulnerable modules within the admin panel. These vulnerabilities could be anything from SQL injection to insecure file handling, potentially leading to RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Module Vulnerabilities (Core or Third-Party) (High-Risk Path): Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Installed Modules (High-Risk Path): Leverage public exploits for outdated or vulnerable modules (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_module_vulnerabilities__core_or_third-party___high-risk_path__exploit_known_vulnerabilities__9d81e39f.md)

Attackers identify the versions of installed PrestaShop modules. If these versions are known to have security vulnerabilities (published in CVEs or security advisories), attackers can utilize readily available exploit code to compromise the application. This often involves sending crafted requests to the vulnerable module endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Sensitive Data: Exploit File System Access Vulnerabilities: Backup File Exposure (High-Risk Path): Access publicly accessible backup files containing sensitive data (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/steal_sensitive_data_exploit_file_system_access_vulnerabilities_backup_file_exposure__high-risk_path_791bfce0.md)

Attackers discover and access backup files (often with extensions like `.sql`, `.zip`, `.tar.gz`) that are unintentionally left in publicly accessible web directories. These backups can contain the entire database, including customer data, admin credentials (hashed), and other sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (High-Risk Path): Failure to Update PrestaShop and Modules (High-Risk Path): Exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated versions (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_path__failure_to_update_prestashop_and_modules__high-ris_afda8990.md)

Attackers target known security vulnerabilities present in older, unpatched versions of PrestaShop core or its modules. They leverage publicly available information and exploits to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Engine Vulnerabilities (Smarty) (Critical Node): Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (Critical Node): Inject malicious code into Smarty templates (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_engine_vulnerabilities__smarty___critical_node__server-side_template_injection__sst_33ab00c2.md)

Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., Smarty syntax that executes PHP functions) into input fields or by modifying template files if they have gained some level of access. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or escape template input, the Smarty engine will execute the injected code server-side, leading to Remote Code Execution.
