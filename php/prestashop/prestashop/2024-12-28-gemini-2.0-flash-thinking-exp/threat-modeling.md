### High and Critical PrestaShop Core Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the PrestaShop core.

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution in PrestaShop Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in the PrestaShop core code (e.g., insecure deserialization, flaws in file handling). They craft a malicious request that exploits this flaw, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the PrestaShop instance. This could involve uploading a webshell, modifying system files, or accessing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the PrestaShop server. Attackers can steal sensitive customer data, financial information, modify product listings, deface the website, or use the server for further malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core (specific functions or classes related to input processing, file handling, or serialization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep PrestaShop core updated to the latest version. Follow secure coding practices during development. Implement input validation and sanitization. Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass in PrestaShop Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in PrestaShop's authentication mechanism to gain unauthorized access to administrative or customer accounts without providing valid credentials. This could involve exploiting logic errors, timing attacks, or flaws in password reset functionalities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of store settings, manipulation of customer orders, and potential financial loss. Compromised admin accounts can lead to complete site takeover.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core (authentication classes, session management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep PrestaShop core updated. Enforce strong password policies. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts. Regularly review and audit authentication logic.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through PrestaShop Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the PrestaShop core to access sensitive information that should not be publicly accessible. This could involve accessing configuration files, database credentials, API keys, or internal system details through insecure file access or flawed error handling.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data can lead to further attacks, such as database breaches, API abuse, or complete system compromise. It can also result in privacy violations and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Core (file system access, error handling mechanisms, configuration management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Restrict file system permissions. Implement secure error handling that doesn't reveal sensitive information. Securely store configuration files and database credentials. Regularly review access controls.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Update Packages
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the PrestaShop update servers or the distribution channel, injecting malicious code into update packages for the core. Users who apply these updates unknowingly install malware.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of PrestaShop installations, leading to data theft, website defacement, and potential server takeover.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Update Mechanism, Core.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Verify the integrity of update packages using digital signatures. Monitor PrestaShop security advisories. Ensure secure communication channels for updates.

*   **Threat:** API Authentication and Authorization Flaws
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in PrestaShop's API authentication or authorization mechanisms allow attackers to access or manipulate API endpoints without proper credentials or with insufficient privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of store data, or abuse of API functionalities.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop API (authentication and authorization logic, specific API endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Enforce proper authorization checks on all API endpoints. Use API keys and rate limiting.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Credentials during Installation
    *   **Description:** The PrestaShop installation process sets weak default credentials for administrative accounts that are not immediately changed by the user. Attackers can exploit these default credentials to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the PrestaShop installation.
    *   **Affected Component:** PrestaShop Installation Process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Force users to set strong, unique passwords during the installation process. Provide clear guidance on changing default credentials.
