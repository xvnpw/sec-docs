### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Core PrestaShop Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]

This top-level node represents the overarching goal of an attacker to leverage weaknesses within the fundamental codebase of PrestaShop. Success at this level grants significant control and access to the application and its underlying data. The "HIGH RISK PATH" designation underscores the severe potential consequences of such exploitation.

#### 4.2. Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]

SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities arise when user-supplied data is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, manipulating the query's logic and potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database.

##### 4.2.1. Target Vulnerable Core Queries:

* **Description:** Attackers meticulously examine PrestaShop's core PHP files, identifying database interaction points where user input is directly used in SQL queries without adequate escaping or parameterized queries. This could involve parameters passed through GET or POST requests, cookies, or other input sources.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual):**  Imagine a simplified scenario where a product ID is taken directly from the URL:
      ```php
      $product_id = $_GET['id'];
      $sql = "SELECT * FROM ps_product WHERE id_product = " . $product_id;
      $result = Db::getInstance()->executeS($sql);
      ```
      An attacker could manipulate the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL, such as `?id=1 OR 1=1--`, which would bypass the intended filtering and potentially return all products.
    * **Attack Scenarios:**
        * **Data Exfiltration:**  Injecting queries to extract sensitive customer data, order information, administrator credentials, etc.
        * **Data Modification:**  Injecting queries to alter product prices, change order statuses, or modify user accounts.
        * **Privilege Escalation:**  Injecting queries to grant themselves administrative privileges.
        * **Database Server Takeover (in severe cases):**  Depending on database configurations and permissions, advanced SQLi could potentially lead to command execution on the database server.
* **Impact:**  Critical. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the application's data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  This is the most effective defense against SQL Injection. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries. Use whitelisting to allow only expected characters and formats.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure database user accounts used by PrestaShop have only the necessary permissions.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Proactively identify and fix potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  Can help detect and block SQL injection attempts.

##### 4.2.2. Target Vulnerable API Endpoints:

* **Description:** PrestaShop exposes various API endpoints for different functionalities. If these endpoints accept user input that is directly used in database queries without proper sanitization, they become targets for SQL injection attacks.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual):**  Consider an API endpoint that allows filtering products by name:
      ```php
      $product_name = $_GET['name'];
      $sql = "SELECT * FROM ps_product WHERE name LIKE '%" . $product_name . "%'";
      $result = Db::getInstance()->executeS($sql);
      ```
      An attacker could inject malicious SQL through the `name` parameter, such as `?name=%' OR 1=1--`.
    * **Attack Scenarios:** Similar to targeting core queries, attackers can exploit API endpoints to exfiltrate, modify, or delete data, and potentially escalate privileges.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Compromise of API endpoints can have widespread impact, potentially affecting integrations with other systems and exposing sensitive data.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Apply the same SQL Injection mitigation strategies as for core queries:** Parameterized queries, input validation, and sanitization are crucial for API endpoints.
    * **API Input Validation:**  Implement robust validation rules for all API parameters, including data types, formats, and allowed values.
    * **Authentication and Authorization:**  Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place for API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation.
    * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from making excessive requests and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]

Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities are among the most severe, as they allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the PrestaShop application. This grants them complete control over the system.

##### 4.3.1. Template Injection:

* **Description:** PrestaShop uses the Smarty template engine to render dynamic content. Template injection vulnerabilities occur when user-controlled input is directly embedded into Smarty templates without proper escaping or when vulnerable Smarty functions are used. This allows attackers to inject malicious code that is then executed by the template engine.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual):**  Imagine a scenario where a user-provided message is directly displayed in a template:
      ```smarty
      <h1>{$message}</h1>
      ```
      If the `$message` variable is not properly escaped and an attacker can control its value, they could inject Smarty code like `{php}system('rm -rf /');{/php}` (though `php` tags are often disabled for security reasons, other dangerous Smarty functions might exist or be exploitable).
    * **Attack Scenarios:**
        * **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Executing system commands to gain control of the server, install malware, or manipulate files.
        * **Data Breaches:**  Accessing sensitive files and databases on the server.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Executing commands that crash the server or consume excessive resources.
* **Impact:** Critical. Successful template injection can lead to complete server compromise.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Output Encoding:**  Always escape user-provided data before displaying it in Smarty templates using appropriate escaping functions (e.g., `escapeHtml`).
    * **Disable or Restrict Dangerous Smarty Functions:**  Configure Smarty to disable or restrict the use of functions that can execute arbitrary code (e.g., `{php}`, `eval`).
    * **Secure Template Development Practices:**  Educate developers on secure template development practices and the risks of template injection.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating some potential consequences of RCE.

##### 4.3.2. Insecure File Uploads:

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in file upload functionalities allow attackers to upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts, to the server. If these uploaded files can be accessed and executed by the web server, the attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary code.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual):**  A simplified example of an insecure upload handler:
      ```php
      $target_dir = "uploads/";
      $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);
      move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $target_file);
      ```
      This code lacks proper validation of the file type and allows uploading files to a publicly accessible directory. An attacker could upload a PHP backdoor script.
    * **Attack Scenarios:**
        * **Web Shell Upload:**  Uploading a PHP script that provides a web-based interface for executing commands on the server.
        * **Malware Deployment:**  Uploading and executing malware to compromise the server or other systems on the network.
        * **Data Exfiltration:**  Uploading scripts to access and download sensitive data.
* **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation can lead to complete server compromise.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict File Type Validation:**  Validate file types based on their content (magic numbers) and not just the file extension. Use a whitelist of allowed file types.
    * **Rename Uploaded Files:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent attackers from predicting their URLs and executing them directly.
    * **Store Uploaded Files Outside the Webroot:**  Store uploaded files in a directory that is not directly accessible by the web server. Access them through a controlled script that performs necessary security checks.
    * **Disable Script Execution in Upload Directories:**  Configure the web server to prevent the execution of scripts in upload directories (e.g., using `.htaccess` for Apache).
    * **Implement File Size Limits:**  Restrict the maximum size of uploaded files to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    * **Regular Security Audits of Upload Functionalities:**  Thoroughly review file upload code for potential vulnerabilities.
