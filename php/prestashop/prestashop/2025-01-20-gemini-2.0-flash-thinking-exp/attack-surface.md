# Attack Surface Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Module Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in modules developed by third-party developers.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** PrestaShop's architecture allows for easy integration of third-party modules, creating a large ecosystem but also introducing potential vulnerabilities if these modules are not securely coded. PrestaShop doesn't inherently vet all third-party modules for security.
    *   **Example:** A popular shipping module has an unpatched SQL injection vulnerability allowing an attacker to extract customer data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (customer information, orders, etc.), website defacement, potential for remote code execution leading to full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization in module development. Follow secure coding practices. Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities. Conduct thorough testing and security audits before releasing modules.
        *   **Users:**  Only install modules from trusted sources and reputable developers. Research module developers and their security track record. Keep all installed modules updated to the latest versions. Regularly review installed modules and remove any that are no longer needed or supported. Consider using security modules that scan for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Theme Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_theme_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in themes developed by third-party developers.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** Similar to modules, PrestaShop's theming system allows for easy integration of third-party themes, which may contain vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
    *   **Example:** A theme contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into pages viewed by customers.
    *   **Impact:**  Customer account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, theft of session cookies, website defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Sanitize user input in theme templates. Avoid including external resources from untrusted sources. Follow secure coding practices for front-end development.
        *   **Users:**  Choose themes from reputable marketplaces or developers with a good security history. Keep the active theme updated. Avoid using nulled or pirated themes. Regularly review theme files for suspicious code if customization is done.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel Brute-Force Attacks](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel_brute-force_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempting to guess admin credentials through repeated login attempts.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** PrestaShop's default admin panel login page is a well-known target. Without proper security measures, it's susceptible to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to try thousands of username/password combinations against the admin login page.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the admin panel, leading to full control of the store, including data manipulation, financial fraud, and malware injection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust rate limiting on login attempts. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin logins.
        *   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords for admin accounts. Change the default admin folder name. Implement IP address whitelisting or blacklisting for admin access. Utilize security modules that offer brute-force protection.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads in Modules or Themes](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads_in_modules_or_themes.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities allowing attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., PHP shells) to the server.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** Modules or themes might have file upload functionalities that lack proper validation and security checks.
    *   **Example:** A module allows uploading product images without proper validation, enabling an attacker to upload a PHP script that grants them remote access.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, website defacement, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension. Sanitize filenames. Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible. Implement access controls on uploaded files.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about installing modules or themes that require file uploads. Regularly review uploaded files for suspicious content. Ensure proper file permissions are set on the server.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Modules or Core](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_modules_or_core.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the database.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:**  Both core PrestaShop code and modules can be vulnerable if database queries are not properly parameterized or if input is not sanitized.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable module allows an attacker to manipulate a product search query to extract all customer passwords from the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution in some database configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database. Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data. Regularly review and audit database interaction code.
        *   **Users:** Keep PrestaShop and all modules updated to patch known SQL injection vulnerabilities. Regularly review module code if custom development is involved.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Modules or Themes](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_modules_or_themes.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How PrestaShop Contributes:** Modules and themes might not properly sanitize user input before displaying it on the page.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable theme displays a customer's name without proper encoding, allowing an attacker to inject JavaScript that steals session cookies.
    *   **Impact:** Account hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, theft of sensitive information, website defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Implement proper output encoding for all user-supplied data displayed on the page. Use context-aware encoding techniques. Regularly review and audit front-end code.
        *   **Users:** Keep PrestaShop and all modules/themes updated to patch known XSS vulnerabilities. Be cautious about clicking on suspicious links or entering data on untrusted sites.
