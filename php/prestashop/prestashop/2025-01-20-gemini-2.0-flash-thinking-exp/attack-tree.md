## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Core PrestaShop Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_core_prestashop_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Core PrestaShop Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Target Vulnerable Core Queries:
            * Attackers identify and exploit flaws in PrestaShop's database interaction logic within the core codebase. This could involve manipulating user input to inject malicious SQL queries, allowing them to bypass security checks, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
        * Target Vulnerable API Endpoints:
            * Attackers target insecure API calls that directly interact with the database without proper sanitization or authorization checks. This allows them to inject malicious SQL through API parameters, achieving the same outcomes as targeting core queries.
    * **Exploit Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Template Injection:
            * Attackers inject malicious code into Smarty template files or exploit vulnerable template rendering mechanisms. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server when the template is processed.
        * Insecure File Uploads:
            * Attackers upload malicious PHP files through vulnerable upload functionalities, such as those found in module uploaders or image uploaders. Once uploaded, these files can be accessed and executed, granting the attacker control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Module Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_module_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Module Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Modules [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in widely used PrestaShop modules. Exploit code is often readily available, making this a relatively easy attack vector for even less skilled attackers. The impact can range from data breaches to complete site compromise, depending on the module and the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Abuse Administrative Features [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__abuse_administrative_features__high_risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Abuse Administrative Features [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit Weak or Default Admin Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Brute-force Admin Login:
            * Attackers use automated tools to try numerous password combinations to guess the admin login credentials. If weak passwords are used, this attack can be successful.
        * Use Default Credentials:
            * Attackers attempt to log in using default administrator credentials that were not changed after the initial PrestaShop installation. This is a very low-effort attack if default credentials persist.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Insecurely Configured Installation Directory [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/access_insecurely_configured_installation_directory__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Installation Process Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Access Insecurely Configured Installation Directory [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * If the `/install` directory is not removed or properly secured after the PrestaShop installation is complete, attackers can access it. This directory may contain sensitive information or vulnerable scripts that can be exploited to gain access or re-install the application maliciously.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Database Directly](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_database_directly.md)

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Database Directly:**
    * **Obtain Database Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * Access Configuration Files:
            * Attackers gain access to the web server file system (often through other vulnerabilities) and retrieve database credentials from configuration files like `parameters.php`. If file permissions are weak, this is a straightforward process.
