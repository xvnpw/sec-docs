# Threat Model Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Core Code](./threats/sql_injection_in_core_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate input fields or URL parameters to inject malicious SQL queries into database interactions within the PrestaShop core. This could allow them to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data (customer information, admin credentials, financial data), modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, complete compromise of the database, potential server takeover.

**Affected Component:** PrestaShop core codebase, particularly database interaction functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize PrestaShop's built-in database abstraction layer (e.g., using Doctrine ORM with parameterized queries).
* Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in database queries within the core.
* Regularly update PrestaShop to the latest version, which includes security patches for core vulnerabilities.
* Perform static and dynamic code analysis of the core codebase to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Core Templates or Functionality](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_core_templates_or_functionality.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into website content generated by the PrestaShop core that is then executed in the browsers of other users. This could allow them to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.

**Affected Component:** PrestaShop core templates (Smarty), core JavaScript files, and any core functionality that displays user-generated content without proper encoding.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper output encoding for all user-generated content displayed by the core on the website. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML context, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript context).
* Utilize PrestaShop's built-in security functions for output encoding within the core.
* Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
* Regularly update PrestaShop to patch known XSS vulnerabilities in the core.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Template Injection](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_template_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the Smarty templating engine (used by the PrestaShop core) or insecurely developed core themes to inject malicious code that is then executed on the server. This could allow them to gain complete control of the server, install malware, or steal sensitive data.

**Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, malware installation, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Smarty templating engine, PrestaShop core theme files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the Smarty templating engine is up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities.
* Develop core themes following secure coding practices, avoiding direct execution of arbitrary code within templates.
* Restrict access to core template modification functionalities.
* Implement regular security audits of core themes.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling in Core](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling_in_core.md)

**Description:** Attackers could upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, web shells) through vulnerable file upload functionalities within the PrestaShop core (e.g., product image uploads, attachment uploads). These files could then be executed on the server, granting the attacker control.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, data theft, server compromise.

**Affected Component:** File upload functionalities within the PrestaShop core.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly validate file types and extensions allowed for upload within the core.
* Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities in core file upload handling.
* Store uploaded files outside of the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions.
* Implement content scanning for files uploaded through core functionalities to detect malicious content.

## Threat: [API Vulnerabilities Leading to Data Exposure or Manipulation](./threats/api_vulnerabilities_leading_to_data_exposure_or_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in PrestaShop's core web service APIs (if enabled) to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., customer information, order details) or manipulate data (e.g., modify orders, create fraudulent accounts). This could involve authentication bypasses, insufficient authorization checks, or vulnerabilities in core API endpoints.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, financial loss, reputation damage.

**Affected Component:** PrestaShop Webservice API (core implementation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for core API access.
* Carefully validate and sanitize all input data received through the core API.
* Rate-limit core API requests to prevent abuse.
* Regularly audit core API endpoints for security vulnerabilities.
* Only expose necessary core API endpoints and restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Auto-Update Mechanism Compromise](./threats/auto-update_mechanism_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the PrestaShop update server or the core update delivery mechanism to distribute malicious updates containing malware or backdoors to unsuspecting stores.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of PrestaShop installations, data breach, server takeover.

**Affected Component:** PrestaShop's core auto-update system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the communication channel for core updates is secure (e.g., using HTTPS with proper certificate validation).
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) for core update packages.
* Consider manual updates or staged rollouts for critical core updates.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Payment Gateway Integrations within Core](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_payment_gateway_integrations_within_core.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the core modules or methods used to integrate with payment gateways, potentially leading to unauthorized transactions, theft of payment information, or redirection of payments.

**Impact:** Financial loss, data breach (payment card information), reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Core payment gateway integration modules and related functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that core payment gateway integration code follows secure coding practices.
* Keep core payment gateway integration components up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Follow PCI DSS compliance guidelines for handling payment card data within the core.
* Implement secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for all payment-related transactions handled by the core.
