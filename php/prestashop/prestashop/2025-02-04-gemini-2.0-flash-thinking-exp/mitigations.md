# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Control Module and Theme Sources (PrestaShop Ecosystem)](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_control_module_and_theme_sources__prestashop_ecosystem_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize PrestaShop Addons Marketplace as primary source:**  Prioritize modules and themes from the official PrestaShop Addons Marketplace due to their review process (though not foolproof, it offers a baseline of scrutiny).
    2.  **Vet developers outside Marketplace:** If using modules/themes from outside the Marketplace, thoroughly vet the developer's reputation, security track record, and community feedback. Check for developer profiles on PrestaShop forums or communities.
    3.  **Disable non-essential module sources:** If PrestaShop configuration allows, restrict module installation to specific sources or require administrator approval for installations from unknown sources.
    4.  **Leverage PrestaShop's module manager for updates:**  Utilize the PrestaShop module manager to check for updates from the Addons Marketplace and trusted developers.
    5.  **Educate users on PrestaShop module risks:** Train administrators and developers about the inherent risks of installing modules and themes, especially from untrusted sources within the PrestaShop ecosystem.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malware Injection via Modules/Themes (High Severity):** Malicious code embedded within PrestaShop modules or themes from untrusted sources.
    *   **Backdoors in Modules/Themes (High Severity):**  Hidden backdoors introduced through compromised or malicious PrestaShop modules/themes.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party PrestaShop Extensions (High/Medium Severity):** Security flaws in modules and themes due to poor coding practices or lack of security awareness by developers within the PrestaShop ecosystem.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malware Injection via Modules/Themes:** High risk reduction.  Significantly reduces the chance of installing malware by focusing on trusted PrestaShop sources.
    *   **Backdoors in Modules/Themes:** High risk reduction. Makes it harder for attackers to introduce backdoors through PrestaShop extensions.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party PrestaShop Extensions:** Medium to High risk reduction. Reduces exposure to vulnerabilities from less reputable developers in the PrestaShop ecosystem, but vetting is still crucial.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. We generally prefer modules from the official marketplace, but there isn't a formal policy or enforced blocking of other sources. Vetting of external developers is inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal policy document for PrestaShop module/theme sourcing.
    *   Technical controls within PrestaShop or server-level to restrict module sources.
    *   Mandatory vetting process for developers outside the PrestaShop Addons Marketplace.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Modules and Themes (PrestaShop Update Mechanism)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_modules_and_themes__prestashop_update_mechanism_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize PrestaShop's module update notifications:** Regularly check the PrestaShop admin panel for module and theme update notifications.
    2.  **Subscribe to PrestaShop security channels:** Monitor PrestaShop's official security blog, newsletters, and social media for announcements regarding core, module, and theme security updates.
    3.  **Test updates in PrestaShop staging environment:**  Always test module and theme updates in a dedicated PrestaShop staging environment that mirrors the production setup before applying them to the live store.
    4.  **Prioritize PrestaShop security updates:** Treat security updates for PrestaShop core, modules, and themes as critical and apply them promptly.
    5.  **Document PrestaShop update procedures:** Create and maintain documented procedures specifically for updating PrestaShop core, modules, and themes, including rollback steps within the PrestaShop environment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known PrestaShop Module/Theme Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Attackers targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in outdated PrestaShop modules and themes.
    *   **Compromise through Outdated PrestaShop Extensions (High Severity):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in older versions of PrestaShop modules and themes to gain control of the store.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known PrestaShop Module/Theme Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction.  Significantly reduces the risk of attacks targeting known flaws in PrestaShop extensions.
    *   **Compromise through Outdated PrestaShop Extensions:** High risk reduction.  Keeps the PrestaShop environment secure against exploits targeting older module/theme versions.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. We attempt to update modules and themes periodically, but it's not on a strict schedule. Testing in staging is sometimes skipped for minor PrestaShop extension updates. Security updates are not always prioritized within PrestaShop update cycles.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal update schedule and documented process specifically for PrestaShop updates.
    *   Automated or semi-automated system to track PrestaShop module/theme updates.
    *   Strict process for prioritizing and rapidly deploying security updates within the PrestaShop update workflow.
    *   Consistent use of a PrestaShop staging environment for testing all updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure the Administration Directory (PrestaShop Admin Panel)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_the_administration_directory__prestashop_admin_panel_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rename PrestaShop's default admin folder:** During PrestaShop installation or post-installation, rename the default `/admin` directory to a unique, less predictable name using PrestaShop's configuration or manual file system operations.
    2.  **Implement IP whitelisting for PrestaShop admin access:** Configure web server or firewall rules to restrict access to the renamed PrestaShop administration directory to only authorized IP addresses or IP ranges.
    3.  **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in PrestaShop:**  Activate PrestaShop's built-in 2FA feature or use a compatible module for administrator accounts.
    4.  **Utilize PrestaShop's security settings:** Explore and configure security-related settings within the PrestaShop admin panel, such as password policies and session management.
    5.  **Regularly audit PrestaShop admin user accounts:** Review administrator accounts within PrestaShop periodically and remove or disable unnecessary accounts. Enforce strong password policies using PrestaShop's password management features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on PrestaShop Admin Login (High Severity):** Attackers attempting to guess administrator credentials to access the PrestaShop backend.
    *   **Credential Stuffing against PrestaShop Admin Panel (High Severity):** Using compromised credentials to log in to the PrestaShop admin panel.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to PrestaShop Administration (High Severity):**  Gaining unauthorized access to control the PrestaShop store and its data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on PrestaShop Admin Login:** High risk reduction. Renaming admin directory and IP whitelisting significantly reduces the attack surface targeting the PrestaShop admin panel. 2FA adds strong protection.
    *   **Credential Stuffing against PrestaShop Admin Panel:** High risk reduction. 2FA effectively mitigates credential stuffing attempts against PrestaShop admin accounts.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to PrestaShop Administration:** High risk reduction. Combined measures make unauthorized access to the PrestaShop backend significantly harder.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. We have renamed the admin directory. IP whitelisting for PrestaShop admin is considered but not consistently applied. 2FA is encouraged but not mandatory for all PrestaShop admin accounts.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Mandatory 2FA for all PrestaShop administrator accounts.
    *   Formal IP whitelisting rules and enforcement specifically for PrestaShop admin access.
    *   Leveraging PrestaShop's built-in security settings more comprehensively.
    *   Regular audits of PrestaShop admin user accounts and password policies within the PrestaShop user management system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debug Mode in Production (PrestaShop Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debug_mode_in_production__prestashop_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify PrestaShop's `_PS_MODE_DEV_` constant:**  In the `config/defines.inc.php` file of your PrestaShop installation, explicitly set `define('_PS_MODE_DEV_', false);` for the production environment. This is a core PrestaShop configuration setting.
    2.  **Review PrestaShop error reporting settings:** Check error reporting configuration within PrestaShop's admin panel (if available) or directly in `config/defines.inc.php` and PHP configuration. Ensure error reporting is minimized in production to avoid exposing sensitive PrestaShop details.
    3.  **Utilize PrestaShop environment variables:** If deploying in different environments, use PrestaShop's environment variable capabilities (if available in your PrestaShop version) to manage debug mode and other environment-specific settings.
    4.  **Document PrestaShop environment configurations:** Clearly document the intended configuration for each PrestaShop environment (development, staging, production), especially regarding debug mode.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via PrestaShop Debug Output (Medium Severity):** Debug mode in PrestaShop can reveal sensitive configuration details, database credentials, and code paths in error messages.
    *   **PrestaShop Specific Information Leakage (Low Severity):**  Debug mode might expose PrestaShop version information or internal workings that could be helpful to attackers targeting PrestaShop specifically.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via PrestaShop Debug Output:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive PrestaShop configuration and internal details through debug mode errors.
    *   **PrestaShop Specific Information Leakage:** Low risk reduction. Minimizes information leakage that could aid attackers in targeting the PrestaShop platform.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely implemented. Debug mode is generally disabled in production PrestaShop environments as a standard practice. However, explicit verification of the `_PS_MODE_DEV_` setting in `defines.inc.php` is needed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated configuration management for PrestaShop environment settings, including debug mode.
    *   Regular automated checks to verify `_PS_MODE_DEV_` is set to `false` in production PrestaShop instances.
    *   Clear documentation specifically for PrestaShop developers regarding debug mode settings in different environments.
