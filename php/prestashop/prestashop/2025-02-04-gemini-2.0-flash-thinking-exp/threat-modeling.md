# Threat Model Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Module](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_module.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability in a third-party PrestaShop module. This could involve sending malicious requests to the vulnerable module's endpoints, injecting code through exposed parameters, or leveraging insecure functionalities within the module.

**Impact:**  Full website compromise, data breach (customer data, orders, potentially payment information), website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, installation of backdoors for persistent access.

**Affected PrestaShop Component:** Third-Party Modules (e.g., payment modules, SEO modules, marketing modules, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet modules before installation: check developer reputation, reviews, security history.
*   Prefer modules from the official PrestaShop Addons Marketplace.
*   Regularly update all installed modules to the latest versions.
*   Implement a module vulnerability scanning process (manual or automated).
*   Minimize the number of installed modules.
*   Disable or uninstall unused modules.

## Threat: [Malicious Module Installation (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/malicious_module_installation__supply_chain_attack_.md)

**Description:** An attacker distributes a seemingly legitimate module that contains hidden malicious code.  Upon installation, this code executes within the PrestaShop environment, allowing the attacker to gain control. This could be distributed through unofficial channels or even by compromising a legitimate developer account.

**Impact:**  Complete server takeover, data theft, injection of malware into the website, redirection of users to phishing sites, long-term persistent compromise.

**Affected PrestaShop Component:** Module installation process, potentially core files if the module modifies them.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Download modules only from the official PrestaShop Addons Marketplace or trusted developers' official websites.
*   Verify module integrity using checksums if provided.
*   Implement code integrity monitoring for installed modules to detect unauthorized modifications.
*   Consider code review of modules, especially those handling sensitive data or core functionalities.
*   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block suspicious module behavior.

## Threat: [Unpatched PrestaShop Core Vulnerability](./threats/unpatched_prestashop_core_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a publicly disclosed or zero-day vulnerability in the PrestaShop core code. They might use publicly available exploit code or develop their own to target known weaknesses in older versions of PrestaShop.

**Impact:**  Full system compromise, database access, data exfiltration, website defacement, denial of service, remote code execution.

**Affected PrestaShop Component:** PrestaShop Core (various components depending on the vulnerability, e.g., controllers, libraries, database interaction logic)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep PrestaShop core updated to the latest stable version.
*   Subscribe to PrestaShop security advisories and apply security patches immediately.
*   Implement a vulnerability scanning process for the PrestaShop core using security tools.
*   Use a WAF to provide virtual patching and protection against known exploits before updates are applied.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Smarty](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_smarty.md)

**Description:** An attacker finds a way to inject malicious Smarty code into a template that is processed by the Smarty engine. This is often achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in custom modules or themes that improperly handle user input and pass it directly to Smarty for rendering.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution on the server, full system compromise, data manipulation, website defacement.

**Affected PrestaShop Component:** Smarty Templating Engine, custom modules and themes using Smarty, potentially core modules if vulnerabilities exist there.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never pass unsanitized user input directly to Smarty templates.**
*   Use Smarty's built-in escaping and sanitization functions (e.g., `escape` modifier).
*   Implement robust input validation and output encoding in modules and themes.
*   Regularly audit template code for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
*   Use a WAF to detect and block SSTI attempts.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload (Product Images, Module Uploads)](./threats/insecure_file_upload__product_images__module_uploads_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in PrestaShop's file upload functionalities (e.g., product image uploads, module uploads, theme uploads). They upload a malicious file (e.g., a PHP shell) disguised as a legitimate file type. If the server executes this file, the attacker gains control.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, website defacement, malware hosting, data theft, potential for lateral movement within the server.

**Affected PrestaShop Component:** File upload functionalities in PrestaShop core and modules (e.g., product management, module installation, theme installation).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement strict file type validation:** only allow necessary file types (e.g., images for product uploads).
*   **Sanitize filenames:** prevent directory traversal attacks and malicious characters in filenames.
*   **Store uploaded files outside the web root:** prevent direct execution of uploaded files.
*   **Configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in upload directories.**
*   **Scan uploaded files for malware** using antivirus or malware scanning tools.
*   **Restrict access to file upload functionalities** based on user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Delayed PrestaShop Updates](./threats/delayed_prestashop_updates.md)

**Description:**  Administrators fail to apply security updates for PrestaShop core and modules in a timely manner. This leaves the website vulnerable to publicly known exploits that attackers can easily leverage.

**Impact:**  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, system compromise, data breaches, website defacement, reputational damage.

**Affected PrestaShop Component:** Entire PrestaShop installation becomes vulnerable due to outdated components.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Establish a regular update schedule** for PrestaShop core and modules.
*   **Monitor PrestaShop security advisories and release notes** for new updates and security patches.
*   **Implement automated update processes** where possible (with thorough testing in a staging environment before production).
*   **Use a staging environment** to test updates before applying them to the production website.
*   **Have a rollback plan** in case updates cause issues.
