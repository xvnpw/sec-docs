# Attack Surface Analysis for prestashop/prestashop

## Attack Surface: [Outdated PrestaShop Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_prestashop_version.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of PrestaShop exposes known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases.
*   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop, like any software, has vulnerabilities discovered and fixed over time. Using older versions means missing these security fixes, directly exposing the application to PrestaShop-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A publicly disclosed Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in PrestaShop version 8.0.3 and earlier. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the store is running an unpatched version, leading to full server compromise.
*   **Impact:** Full website compromise, data breach (customer data, admin credentials), website defacement, malware distribution, remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update PrestaShop core:**  Stay up-to-date with the latest stable PrestaShop releases and security patches.
    *   **Subscribe to security advisories:** Monitor PrestaShop's official channels and security mailing lists for vulnerability announcements.
    *   **Implement a patch management process:** Establish a process for promptly applying security updates.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Modules (Third-Party)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_modules__third-party_.md)

*   **Description:** Modules, especially from third-party developers, can contain security vulnerabilities due to varying code quality and security awareness, directly impacting PrestaShop installations.
*   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop's modular architecture encourages the use of third-party modules, expanding functionality but also introducing potential vulnerabilities *within the PrestaShop ecosystem* if modules are not securely developed.
*   **Example:** A popular third-party module for advanced product filtering contains an SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through the module's filtering functionality to extract sensitive customer data from the PrestaShop database.
*   **Impact:** Website compromise, data theft, backdoors, website defacement, malicious redirects, potential for remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the module vulnerability and its privileges within PrestaShop).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use reputable module sources:** Download modules from the official PrestaShop Addons Marketplace or trusted developers with a proven security track record.
    *   **Review module permissions:** Carefully check the permissions requested by a module before installation. Grant only necessary permissions within PrestaShop.
    *   **Regularly update modules:** Keep modules updated to the latest versions, as developers often release security patches.
    *   **Security audits of modules:** For critical modules, consider performing security audits or penetration testing, especially for custom or less common modules.
    *   **Disable unused modules:** Remove or disable modules that are not actively used to reduce the attack surface within PrestaShop.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection in Core or Modules](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_in_core_or_modules.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in database queries within PrestaShop core or modules allow attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the PrestaShop database or manipulating it.
*   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop's core and modules heavily rely on database interactions. Vulnerabilities in these interactions, specific to PrestaShop's codebase or module code, can lead to SQL injection.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in PrestaShop core's category display functionality allows for SQL injection. An attacker crafts a malicious URL to exploit this, bypassing authentication and retrieving admin user credentials directly from the PrestaShop database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (customer data, admin credentials, financial information stored in PrestaShop database), data manipulation within the store, website unavailability, potential for remote code execution on the database server in some scenarios.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements:**  This is the primary defense against SQL injection within PrestaShop code. Ensure all database interactions in core and modules use these techniques.
    *   **Input validation and sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs *within PrestaShop components* before using them in database queries.
    *   **Principle of least privilege for database users:** Grant database users used by PrestaShop only the necessary permissions. Avoid using overly privileged database users.
    *   **Regular code reviews and security testing:** Conduct code reviews and penetration testing specifically focusing on PrestaShop core and module code to identify and fix potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block common SQL injection attempts targeting PrestaShop applications.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads (Modules, Themes, Core)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads__modules__themes__core_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in file upload functionalities within PrestaShop modules, themes, or core that allow attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, malware) to the server hosting PrestaShop.
*   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop modules and themes often include file upload features. Vulnerabilities in *these PrestaShop specific features* can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A PrestaShop module for customer support tickets allows file attachments. The upload functionality within this module lacks proper file type validation. An attacker uploads a PHP backdoor script disguised as a support document, gaining remote code execution on the PrestaShop server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website takeover, data breach, malware hosting, all directly impacting the PrestaShop installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File type validation:**  Strictly validate file types on the server-side *within PrestaShop upload handlers*, allowing only expected and safe file extensions.
    *   **File size limits:** Implement file size limits within PrestaShop upload features to prevent denial-of-service or resource exhaustion.
    *   **Input sanitization and validation for filenames:** Sanitize and validate filenames *within PrestaShop upload processing* to prevent path traversal attacks and other filename-based vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure file storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web root if possible, or in a directory with restricted execution permissions *configured for the PrestaShop environment*.
    *   **Anti-virus scanning:** Integrate anti-virus scanning for uploaded files *within PrestaShop's file handling processes*.
    *   **Rename uploaded files:**  Rename uploaded files *by PrestaShop* to prevent predictable filenames and potential directory traversal issues.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Admin Panel Security (Default Credentials, Brute Force)](./attack_surfaces/weak_admin_panel_security__default_credentials__brute_force_.md)

*   **Description:**  Inadequate security measures protecting the PrestaShop admin panel, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access specifically to manage the PrestaShop store.
*   **PrestaShop Contribution:** PrestaShop's admin panel is the central control point for managing the store. Weak security *of this PrestaShop component* directly compromises the entire store.
*   **Example:** The default PrestaShop installation uses easily guessable or default credentials. An attacker attempts to log in using common default usernames and passwords and gains access to the PrestaShop admin panel. Alternatively, the PrestaShop admin login page lacks brute-force protection, allowing automated password guessing attacks targeting admin accounts.
*   **Impact:** Full website compromise, data breach, store manipulation, financial loss, all impacting the PrestaShop business operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Change default admin credentials immediately:**  Set strong, unique passwords for all admin accounts during and after PrestaShop installation.
    *   **Implement strong password policies:** Enforce strong password requirements for PrestaShop admin users.
    *   **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):**  Add an extra layer of security to PrestaShop admin login using 2FA.
    *   **Limit login attempts and implement account lockout:**  Implement brute-force protection on the PrestaShop admin login by limiting login attempts and locking out accounts after too many failed attempts.
    *   **Restrict admin panel access by IP address:**  Limit access to the PrestaShop admin panel to specific IP addresses or networks.
    *   **Use a non-default admin panel URL:** Change the default PrestaShop admin panel URL to make it less easily discoverable by attackers.
