## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit PrestaShop Core Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_prestashop_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in PrestaShop core.
    *   **Description:** Attackers research known vulnerabilities (CVEs, security advisories) for the specific PrestaShop version being used. If the application is running an outdated or unpatched version, attackers can leverage readily available exploits to compromise the system.
    *   **Common Vulnerability Types:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining complete control.
        *   SQL Injection (SQLi): Enables attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially extracting sensitive data, modifying data, or bypassing authentication.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially stealing admin session cookies or defacing the website.
        *   Authentication Bypass: Enables attackers to gain administrative access without valid credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit PrestaShop Module Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_prestashop_module_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in PrestaShop modules (plugins).
    *   **Description:** Similar to core vulnerabilities, attackers target known vulnerabilities in installed modules. Modules, especially third-party ones, are often less rigorously tested and can contain security flaws.
    *   **Common Vulnerability Types:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Modules: Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code through vulnerable module functionality.
        *   SQL Injection (SQLi) in Modules: Enables attackers to manipulate database queries through vulnerable module components.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Modules: Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts via module inputs, affecting users and administrators.
        *   Authentication Bypass in Modules: Enables attackers to bypass authentication checks within a module's functionality.
        *   File Inclusion Vulnerability in Modules: Allows attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server through a vulnerable module.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Configuration Weaknesses:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting common misconfigurations in PrestaShop or the server environment.
    *   **Description:** Attackers look for easily identifiable misconfigurations that provide an entry point into the application.
    *   **Common Configuration Weaknesses:**
        *   Default Credentials: Using default administrator credentials that were not changed during installation.
        *   Insecure Server Configuration:
            *   Exposed Debug Mode: Leaving debug mode enabled in production, revealing sensitive information.
            *   Directory Listing Enabled: Allowing directory listing, enabling attackers to browse sensitive files.
        *   Insecure File Permissions: Incorrect file permissions allowing attackers to write to sensitive files like configuration files or module/theme files.
        *   Weak Password Policies: Lack of strong password policies, making accounts vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Authentication and Authorization Flaws:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in PrestaShop's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Description:** Attackers target flaws in how PrestaShop verifies user identity and manages access control.
    *   **Common Authentication/Authorization Flaws:**
        *   Session Hijacking/Fixation: Stealing or fixating admin or customer session cookies to gain unauthorized access.
        *   Insecure Password Reset Mechanism: Exploiting flaws in the password reset process to gain access to accounts.
        *   Insecure Cookie Handling: Exploiting vulnerabilities related to cookie security, such as lack of `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags, making cookies susceptible to theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Supply Chain Attacks (Module Focused):](./attack_tree_paths/5__supply_chain_attacks__module_focused_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the supply chain of PrestaShop modules to inject malicious code.
    *   **Description:** Attackers target the module development and distribution process to inject malicious code into modules. This can have a wide-reaching impact, affecting many PrestaShop installations that use the compromised module.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack Vectors:**
        *   Compromise Module Developer Account: Gaining access to a legitimate module developer's account on marketplaces or distribution channels.
        *   Compromise Module Repository: Gaining access to the code repository (e.g., GitHub) of a module.
        *   Compromise Module Distribution Channel: Compromising the infrastructure of a module distribution channel to inject malicious code into module packages.
        *   Backdoor Module Updates: Pushing malicious updates to existing modules, affecting users who update.
        *   Compromise Existing Module Packages: Modifying existing module packages on distribution channels to include malicious code.
