- Service disruption and downtime, impacting sales and customer trust. This can be caused by technical failures, cyberattacks (DDoS), or lack of scalability.
- Security vulnerabilities in the platform or its extensions that could be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data breaches, defacement, or malware distribution.
- Compliance violations with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) due to inadequate security measures or data handling practices.
- Supply chain risks associated with third-party modules and themes, which could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code.
- Performance issues that negatively impact user experience and conversion rates, leading to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Input validation and sanitization are likely implemented throughout the codebase to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection. (Implementation details would require code review).
- security control: Protection against common web attacks (CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection) is mentioned in PrestaShop documentation and community discussions, suggesting awareness and mitigation efforts. (Documentation and community forums).
- security control: Regular security updates and patches are released by the PrestaShop team to address reported vulnerabilities. (PrestaShop Security Blog, GitHub release notes).
- security control: Password hashing is used for storing user credentials. (Likely implementation in authentication modules, needs code verification).
- security control: HTTPS encryption is recommended and widely adopted for PrestaShop stores to protect data in transit. (PrestaShop documentation, best practices).

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party modules and themes are a potential risk, as PrestaShop relies on an ecosystem of external extensions. Mitigation relies on module vetting and merchant awareness.
- accepted risk: Configuration errors by merchants can introduce security weaknesses, such as weak passwords, misconfigured permissions, or exposed admin panels. Mitigation relies on documentation and best practices guidance.
- accepted risk: Zero-day vulnerabilities in core PrestaShop or underlying technologies are an inherent risk for any software platform. Mitigation relies on proactive security monitoring and incident response capabilities.

Recommended security controls:

- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for merchants and customers, including strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an option, and protection against brute-force attacks.
    - security requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different user roles within the merchant admin panel.
    - security requirement: Secure session management to prevent session hijacking and unauthorized access.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Implement a robust authorization model to control access to resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
    - security requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to all user accounts and system components.
    - security requirement: Secure API access control to protect APIs used by modules and integrations.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    - security requirement: Use of parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - security requirement: Encoding of output data to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms and protocols for protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS, TLS).
    - security requirement: Secure storage of cryptographic keys and secrets.
    - security requirement: Proper implementation of cryptographic functions for password hashing, data encryption, and digital signatures.
