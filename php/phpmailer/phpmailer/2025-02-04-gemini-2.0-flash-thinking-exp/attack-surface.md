# Attack Surface Analysis for phpmailer/phpmailer

## Attack Surface: [Email Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/email_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious headers into email messages by manipulating input fields used for email addresses (To, From, CC, BCC, Reply-To).
*   **PHPMailer Contribution:** PHPMailer uses user-provided input to construct email headers. If input is not sanitized, attackers can inject arbitrary headers through PHPMailer.
*   **Example:** A contact form takes an email address. An attacker enters: `attacker@example.com\nBcc: spamrecipient@example.com`. PHPMailer, without proper sanitization in the application code *before* passing to PHPMailer, sends the email to the intended recipient *and* `spamrecipient@example.com` as a BCC, effectively using the application as a spam relay.
*   **Impact:** Spam distribution, email spoofing, bypassing security filters, reputational damage, blacklisting of sending servers.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation & Sanitization *Before* PHPMailer:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all email address inputs *before* passing them to PHPMailer's address functions. Remove or encode newline characters (`\n`, `\r`) and other header-injection characters.
    *   **Utilize PHPMailer's Address Functions:** Use PHPMailer's `addAddress()`, `addCC()`, `addBCC()`, `addReplyTo()` functions. These provide a basic level of validation but are not sufficient alone and must be combined with robust input sanitization in the application.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/attachment_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit insecure handling of file paths for attachments to access and attach arbitrary files from the server file system.
*   **PHPMailer Contribution:** PHPMailer's `addAttachment()` function can be misused if file paths provided to it are directly derived from user input without validation in the application code.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to "attach a document" by providing a file name. An attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd`. If the application directly uses this path in `addAttachment()` *without validation*, PHPMailer might attach the `/etc/passwd` file to the email, exposing sensitive system information.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive server-side files, arbitrary file attachment, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User-Provided File Paths to PHPMailer:**  Never directly pass user-provided file paths to PHPMailer's `addAttachment()` function without rigorous validation and sanitization in the application.
    *   **Secure File Management in Application:** Implement a secure file upload and management system within the application. Store files securely and reference them internally using identifiers, not direct paths.
    *   **Path Whitelisting and Validation (If absolutely necessary):** If user input *must* influence file selection, strictly whitelist allowed directories and rigorously validate file paths *before* using them with `addAttachment()`.

## Attack Surface: [Plaintext SMTP Authentication](./attack_surfaces/plaintext_smtp_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** SMTP credentials are transmitted in plaintext over the network when encryption (TLS/SSL) is not used for SMTP communication.
*   **PHPMailer Contribution:** PHPMailer supports SMTP and can be configured to use or not use encryption via the `SMTPSecure` property. Incorrect configuration in PHPMailer leads to plaintext transmission.
*   **Example:** An application is configured to use SMTP with PHPMailer, but `SMTPSecure` is not set to `'tls'` or `'ssl'`. An attacker on the network performs packet sniffing and captures the plaintext SMTP username and password during authentication initiated by PHPMailer.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of SMTP credentials, unauthorized access to email sending capabilities, potential for further attacks if SMTP credentials are reused elsewhere.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable SMTP Encryption in PHPMailer Configuration:** **Always** configure PHPMailer to use secure SMTP connections by setting `SMTPSecure = 'tls'` or `SMTPSecure = 'ssl'`.
    *   **Verify SMTP Server Configuration:** Ensure the SMTP server itself supports and is configured for secure connections (TLS/SSL).
    *   **Use STARTTLS or SSL/TLS in PHPMailer:** Explicitly set `SMTPSecure = 'tls'` (STARTTLS) or `SMTPSecure = 'ssl'` (SSL/TLS) in PHPMailer configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of SMTP Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_smtp_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** SMTP credentials (username and password) required by PHPMailer are stored insecurely, making them accessible to attackers.
*   **PHPMailer Contribution:** PHPMailer requires SMTP credentials to be configured via properties like `Username` and `Password`. Insecure storage of these credentials in the application configuration makes the application vulnerable.
*   **Example:** SMTP credentials are hardcoded directly in the PHP code where PHPMailer is initialized, or stored in a configuration file accessible via the web server. An attacker gains access to the source code or configuration file and retrieves the plaintext credentials used by PHPMailer.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of SMTP credentials, unauthorized access to email sending capabilities, potential for further attacks if SMTP credentials are reused elsewhere.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Credential Storage in Application:** **Never hardcode SMTP credentials directly in the application code.**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store credentials in environment variables, which are generally not accessible via the web server and are a more secure configuration method.
    *   **Secret Management Systems:** Utilize dedicated secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store, manage, and retrieve credentials for PHPMailer.
    *   **Secure Configuration Files:** If using configuration files, ensure they are stored outside the web root and have restricted access permissions enforced by the operating system.

## Attack Surface: [Using Outdated PHPMailer Versions](./attack_surfaces/using_outdated_phpmailer_versions.md)

*   **Description:** Using older versions of PHPMailer that may contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   **PHPMailer Contribution:**  Using any version of PHPMailer introduces the risk of vulnerabilities present in that specific version. Outdated versions are more likely to have known, publicly disclosed, and potentially easily exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An application continues to use an old version of PHPMailer that has a publicly known and patched header injection or remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker exploits this known vulnerability in the outdated PHPMailer library to compromise the application.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potential for various attacks depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., header injection, remote code execution, information disclosure).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (Can be Critical if specific vulnerabilities are highly severe and easily exploitable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates of PHPMailer:** **Always use the latest stable version of PHPMailer.** Regularly check for updates and upgrade PHPMailer to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools like Composer (for PHP) to manage PHPMailer and other dependencies, making updates easier and more systematic.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement regular vulnerability scanning of application dependencies, including PHPMailer, to identify and address known vulnerabilities proactively.
