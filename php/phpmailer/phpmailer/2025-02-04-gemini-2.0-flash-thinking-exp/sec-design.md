# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, PHPMailer, is a widely used open-source library for sending emails from PHP applications. Its primary business priority is to provide a reliable and feature-rich solution for developers to integrate email sending functionality into their applications.

Business priorities:
- Reliable email delivery: Ensuring emails are sent and received successfully.
- Ease of integration: Providing a simple and straightforward API for developers to use.
- Feature richness: Supporting various email protocols, authentication methods, and email formats.
- Maintainability: Keeping the library up-to-date, secure, and compatible with modern PHP environments.
- Community support: Leveraging the open-source community for contributions, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.

Business goals:
- To be the leading PHP email sending library.
- To maintain a large and active user base.
- To ensure the library remains secure and reliable.
- To adapt to evolving email standards and technologies.

Most important business risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to exploitation of applications using PHPMailer, resulting in data breaches, spam campaigns, or reputational damage.
- Email delivery failures due to misconfiguration, compatibility issues, or changes in email service provider policies could disrupt critical business processes relying on email communication.
- Lack of maintenance or slow response to security issues could erode user trust and lead to migration to alternative solutions.
- Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies or the PHPMailer distribution channels could compromise the library's integrity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: TLS encryption for SMTP communication. Implemented within PHPMailer configuration options to enable secure connections to SMTP servers.
- security control: Input validation on email addresses and headers to prevent basic injection attacks. Implemented within PHPMailer code, but might not be comprehensive.
- security control: Open-source nature allows for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Described by the project's public availability on GitHub.
- security control: Usage of prepared statements or parameterized queries for database interactions (if applicable for email storage or logging). Depends on the application using PHPMailer.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying PHP environment and server infrastructure.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by PHPMailer.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of PHPMailer by developers leading to security weaknesses (e.g., insecure SMTP settings).
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities might be discovered and exploited before patches are available, despite community review.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by PHPMailer.
- security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development process to automatically detect potential security flaws in the code.
- security control: Provide secure configuration guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using PHPMailer.
- security control: Implement regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and incident response process.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: PHPMailer must support secure authentication mechanisms for SMTP servers, such as username/password, OAuth 2.0, and client certificates.
    - requirement: Credentials for SMTP authentication should be securely stored and managed, avoiding hardcoding in application code.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: The application using PHPMailer should implement authorization controls to ensure only authorized users or processes can send emails. PHPMailer itself does not handle application-level authorization.
- Input validation:
    - requirement: PHPMailer must perform robust input validation on all email inputs, including recipient addresses, sender addresses, subject, body, and headers, to prevent injection attacks (e.g., header injection, command injection).
    - requirement: Input validation should include checks for format, length, and character encoding to prevent unexpected behavior and security issues.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: PHPMailer must enforce TLS encryption for all SMTP communication to protect the confidentiality and integrity of email messages in transit.
    - requirement: PHPMailer should support and encourage the use of cryptographic signatures (e.g., DKIM) and encryption (e.g., S/MIME) for email messages to enhance security and authenticity.

    style build_artifacts fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code, commit changes, and push them to the Git repository (GitHub).
2. Git Repository (GitHub): Hosts the source code of PHPMailer. Code changes trigger a webhook to the CI server.
3. CI Server (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions is used as the CI server. It receives webhook triggers from the Git repository on code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
4. Build Process: The CI server executes the build process defined in GitHub Actions workflows. This typically includes:
    - Checking out the code from the Git repository.
    - Installing dependencies using Composer.
    - Running linters and code formatters.
    - Building distribution packages (e.g., ZIP, Phar).
5. Security Checks: As part of the build process, security checks are performed:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Tools like Psalm or PHPStan can be used to analyze the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency Scanning: Tools like `composer audit` or third-party dependency scanning tools can be used to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
6. Build Artifacts: If the build and security checks are successful, the CI server produces build artifacts, such as distribution packages (ZIP files, Phar archives) of PHPMailer. These artifacts are then ready for release or distribution.

Security Controls in Build Process:
- security control: Automated build process using CI/CD (GitHub Actions) to ensure consistent and repeatable builds.
- security control: Source code hosted in a version control system (Git/GitHub) to track changes and enable code review.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) integrated into the build pipeline to detect potential code vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency scanning to identify and alert on vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- security control: Code linting and formatting to enforce code quality and consistency.
- security control: Build artifacts are generated automatically and can be signed or checksummed for integrity verification.
- security control: Access control to CI/CD pipelines and build artifacts to prevent unauthorized modifications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- For applications using PHPMailer, critical business processes often rely on email communication. Examples include:
    - User registration and account verification.
    - Password reset functionality.
    - Order confirmations and transaction notifications.
    - Marketing and promotional emails.
    - System alerts and notifications.
    - Contact forms and customer support communication.

Disruption or compromise of email sending capabilities can directly impact these business processes, leading to:
- Loss of revenue (e.g., if order confirmations are not sent).
- Customer dissatisfaction and churn (e.g., if password resets fail).
- Reputational damage (e.g., if spam or malicious emails are sent due to vulnerabilities).
- Operational disruptions (e.g., if system alerts are missed).

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Email content: Can contain sensitive information depending on the application and use case. This could include:
    - Personal Identifiable Information (PII) of users (names, email addresses, order details, etc.).
    - Confidential business information.
    - Financial data.
- Recipient email addresses: Considered PII and should be protected to maintain user privacy and prevent unauthorized access or misuse.
- SMTP credentials: Usernames and passwords or API keys used to authenticate with SMTP servers. These are highly sensitive and must be protected to prevent unauthorized email sending and potential abuse of SMTP services.
- Application logs: Logs might contain email sending details, recipient addresses, and potentially parts of email content. Logs should be secured to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure of sensitive information.

Sensitivity levels of data:
- SMTP Credentials: Highly Sensitive - Compromise can lead to unauthorized email sending, spam, and reputational damage.
- PII in Email Content and Recipient Addresses: Sensitive - Requires protection to comply with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and maintain user trust.
- Business Confidential Information in Email Content: Confidential - Requires protection to maintain competitive advantage and prevent leaks of sensitive business data.
- Application Logs: Moderately Sensitive - Should be protected to prevent unauthorized access to email details and potential PII.
