### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1. Header Injection - Critical Node 1.1.1.1. Manipulate Email Headers Input

#### 4.1. Technical Explanation of Header Injection

Email header injection is a type of injection attack that exploits vulnerabilities in email systems or applications that construct email messages. It occurs when an attacker can inject malicious data into email headers, leading to unintended or malicious behavior by email clients and servers.

Email messages are structured into two main parts: **headers** and **body**, separated by a blank line (CRLF - Carriage Return Line Feed, represented as `\r\n`). Headers contain metadata about the email, such as sender, recipient, subject, and routing information.  Email clients and servers parse these headers to understand and process the email.

The core of header injection vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing email headers. If an application directly incorporates user-provided data into header fields without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker can inject special characters, specifically CRLF sequences (`\r\n`), to terminate the current header and start injecting new headers or modify existing ones.

**In the context of PHPMailer:**

PHPMailer provides functions to set various email headers programmatically. If an application uses user input directly to populate these header functions without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to header injection. For example, if user input is used to set the `Subject`, `From`, `To`, `Cc`, `Bcc`, or custom headers, and this input is not validated to prevent CRLF injection, an attacker can manipulate the email headers.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Examples in PHPMailer

The "Manipulate Email Headers Input" critical node highlights several attack vectors. Let's examine each with specific examples in the context of PHPMailer:

* **Injecting `Bcc:` headers for spam/phishing:**
    * **Vulnerability:** An attacker injects `\r\nBcc: attacker@example.com` into a header field that accepts user input (e.g., a "Subject" field if improperly handled).
    * **PHPMailer Code (Vulnerable Example):**
      ```php
      <?php
      use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
      use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

      require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Assuming PHPMailer is installed via Composer

      $mail = new PHPMailer(true);

      try {
          $userInputSubject = $_POST['subject']; // User input from a form
          $mail->setFrom('sender@example.com', 'Sender Name');
          $mail->addAddress('recipient@example.com', 'Recipient Name');
          $mail->Subject = $userInputSubject; // Directly using user input!
          $mail->Body    = 'This is the body of the email.';

          $mail->send();
          echo 'Message has been sent';
      } catch (Exception $e) {
          echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
      }
      ?>
      ```
    * **Attack Payload Example:**  If a user enters in the "subject" field: `Subject Text\r\nBcc: attacker@example.com`
    * **Result:** The email will be sent to `recipient@example.com` and also silently BCC'd to `attacker@example.com`. This can be used for spam campaigns or phishing attempts without the primary recipient's knowledge.

* **Injecting `Cc:` headers for information disclosure:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Similar to Bcc, injecting `\r\nCc: internal.email@example.internal` can expose internal email addresses to external recipients.
    * **Attack Payload Example:** `Subject Text\r\nCc: internal.email@example.internal`
    * **Result:**  The email will be sent to the intended recipient and also CC'd to `internal.email@example.internal`, potentially disclosing sensitive internal contacts.

* **Injecting `Reply-To:` headers for phishing/social engineering:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Injecting `\r\nReply-To: attacker@example.com` can redirect replies to an attacker-controlled address.
    * **Attack Payload Example:** `Subject Text\r\nReply-To: attacker@example.com`
    * **Result:** When the recipient replies to the email, the reply will be sent to `attacker@example.com` instead of the legitimate sender. This is a classic phishing technique to harvest credentials or sensitive information.

* **Injecting `Sender:` or `Return-Path:` to spoof sender address:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Injecting `\r\nSender: attacker@example.com` or `\r\nReturn-Path: attacker@example.com` can manipulate the sender information displayed to recipients and the bounce address for undeliverable emails.
    * **Attack Payload Example:** `Subject Text\r\nSender: attacker@example.com`
    * **Result:** The email might appear to originate from `attacker@example.com` (depending on email client display and server handling), facilitating sender spoofing. `Return-Path` manipulation can be used to avoid receiving bounce messages and further obfuscate the attack.

* **Injecting custom headers to exploit vulnerabilities:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Injecting arbitrary custom headers might exploit vulnerabilities in specific email clients or servers. While less common, some email systems might have vulnerabilities related to parsing or processing specific headers.
    * **Example:**  Injecting a header known to cause parsing errors in a specific email client version, potentially leading to denial of service or other unexpected behavior. This is a more advanced and less predictable attack vector.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

Successful header injection attacks can have significant impact:

* **Email Spoofing:** Attackers can forge the sender address, making emails appear to originate from trusted sources. This is a cornerstone of phishing and social engineering attacks.
* **Phishing Attacks:** By manipulating `Reply-To`, `Sender`, or email body content (often in conjunction with header injection), attackers can craft convincing phishing emails to steal credentials, sensitive data, or distribute malware.
* **Bypassing Security Filters (SPF, DKIM, DMARC):** While header injection itself might not directly bypass SPF/DKIM/DMARC, it can be used in conjunction with other techniques to make spoofed emails appear more legitimate or to redirect responses in a way that circumvents these security measures.
* **Information Disclosure:** Injecting `Cc:` or other headers can unintentionally or maliciously disclose email addresses or other sensitive information to unauthorized recipients.
* **Spam Campaigns:** Injecting `Bcc:` headers allows attackers to send unsolicited emails to a large number of recipients without their knowledge, contributing to spam distribution.
* **Reputation Damage:** If an application is used to send spam or phishing emails due to header injection vulnerabilities, the application's domain and IP address can be blacklisted, damaging its reputation and deliverability of legitimate emails.
* **Exploiting Recipient Systems:** In rare cases, injecting specific custom headers might trigger vulnerabilities in recipient email clients or servers, potentially leading to more severe consequences like remote code execution (though this is less common with modern email systems).

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate header injection vulnerabilities in applications using PHPMailer, the following strategies are recommended:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strict Validation:**  Validate all user-provided input that will be used in email headers. Define allowed characters and formats for each header field (e.g., email addresses, subjects).
    * **CRLF Prevention:**  **Crucially, prevent CRLF characters (`\r\n`, `%0D%0A`, `\n`, `%0A`, `\r`, `%0D`) from being included in user input used for headers.**  This is the most critical step.
    * **Sanitization:** If strict validation is not feasible, sanitize user input by encoding or removing CRLF characters and other potentially harmful characters before using it in headers.

2. **Use PHPMailer's Built-in Features (Where Applicable):**
    * **Utilize PHPMailer's functions for setting headers:** Use functions like `$mail->Subject`, `$mail->setFrom()`, `$mail->addAddress()`, `$mail->addCC()`, `$mail->addBCC()`, `$mail->addReplyTo()`, etc. These functions are designed to handle header encoding and formatting correctly.
    * **Avoid directly manipulating raw header strings:**  Minimize or eliminate the need to manually construct raw header strings using user input. Rely on PHPMailer's API to manage headers.

3. **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only use user input for header fields when absolutely necessary. Avoid using user input for critical headers like `From`, `Sender`, `Return-Path`, or custom headers unless there is a strong and validated use case.
    * **Output Encoding (Context-Aware Encoding):** While primarily for body content, be mindful of output encoding if you are dynamically generating parts of the email body based on user input.

4. **Content Security Policy (CSP) and Email Security Policies (SPF, DKIM, DMARC):**
    * **CSP (for web applications generating emails):** While CSP is primarily for web browsers, consider using CSP headers in the web application that generates emails to further enhance security and potentially mitigate some client-side risks.
    * **SPF, DKIM, DMARC:** Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your sending domain. While these don't directly prevent header injection, they significantly improve email authentication and reduce the effectiveness of sender spoofing attacks originating from outside your domain.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**
    * **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential header injection vulnerabilities in your application.
    * **Code Reviews:** Perform code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input is used to construct emails and headers.

**Example of Mitigation in PHP (using sanitization - removing CRLF):**

```php
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    $userInputSubject = $_POST['subject'];
    // Sanitize user input by removing CRLF characters
    $sanitizedSubject = str_replace(array("\r", "\n", "%0D", "%0A"), '', $userInputSubject);

    $mail->setFrom('sender@example.com', 'Sender Name');
    $mail->addAddress('recipient@example.com', 'Recipient Name');
    $mail->Subject = $sanitizedSubject; // Using sanitized input
    $mail->Body    = 'This is the body of the email.';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
?>
```

**Best Practice:**  Prioritize **strict validation** over sanitization whenever possible. Clearly define what is allowed in each header field and reject any input that does not conform to the defined rules. If sanitization is used, ensure it is robust and effectively removes or encodes all CRLF sequences and other potentially harmful characters.
