## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Header Injection [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__header_injection__high_risk_.md)

**Critical Node: 1.1.1.1. Manipulate Email Headers Input [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used to construct email headers in PHPMailer, injects additional or modified headers. This is possible if the application directly uses user-provided data to set email headers without proper validation or sanitization.
    * **Example Actions:**
        * Injecting `Bcc:` headers to send emails to unintended recipients, potentially for spam or phishing campaigns.
        * Injecting `Cc:` headers for information disclosure.
        * Injecting `Reply-To:` headers to redirect replies to an attacker-controlled address for phishing or social engineering.
        * Injecting `Sender:` or `Return-Path:` to spoof the sender's email address.
        * Injecting custom headers that might exploit vulnerabilities in email clients or servers.
    * **Impact:** Email spoofing, phishing attacks, bypassing security filters (e.g., SPF, DKIM), information disclosure through internal headers, and potentially triggering vulnerabilities in recipient email systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Command Injection [HIGH RISK - RCE Potential]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__command_injection__high_risk_-_rce_potential_.md)

**Critical Node: 1.1.3.1. Vulnerable Application Logic using PHPMailer Parameters [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** Although PHPMailer core is generally safe from direct command injection, vulnerable application logic *using* PHPMailer can introduce this risk. If the application uses user input to dynamically construct PHPMailer parameters that are then interpreted as commands by the underlying system or libraries, command injection becomes possible. This is less about PHPMailer's vulnerabilities and more about insecure application design around its usage.
    * **Example Actions (Hypothetical and less direct in PHPMailer):**
        * If the application were to use user input to construct file paths for attachments in a way that is then passed to a system command (though PHPMailer itself doesn't directly do this), command injection could occur. This is highly dependent on flawed application logic *around* PHPMailer, not within PHPMailer itself.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This is the most severe impact, allowing the attacker to fully compromise the server and application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Attachment Path Traversal [HIGH RISK if user-defined paths allowed]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__attachment_path_traversal__high_risk_if_user-defined_paths_allowed_.md)

**Critical Node: 1.2.1.1. Manipulate Attachment File Path Input [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to specify file paths for attachments (which is generally bad practice), and these paths are not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker can use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) to access files outside the intended directory.
    * **Example Actions:**
        * Providing a malicious file path like `../../../../etc/passwd` as an attachment path.
        * Accessing sensitive configuration files, application code, or system files.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure by reading arbitrary files from the server. This can lead to exposure of sensitive data, credentials, or application logic, which can be used for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Resource Exhaustion (Email Bombing) [HIGH RISK - Service Disruption]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__resource_exhaustion__email_bombing___high_risk_-_service_disruption_.md)

**Critical Node: 1.3.1.1. Abuse Email Sending Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker abuses the application's email sending functionality to send a massive volume of emails or very large emails. This can overwhelm the application's resources, the SMTP server, or network bandwidth.
    * **Example Actions:**
        * Scripting to repeatedly trigger email sending functionality with large recipient lists or large attachments.
        * Exploiting application features that allow sending emails to multiple recipients at once.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application or email sending service becomes unavailable to legitimate users due to resource exhaustion. This can lead to business disruption and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Weak or Default SMTP Credentials [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__weak_or_default_smtp_credentials__high_risk_.md)

**Critical Node: 2.1.1.1. Use Default or Easily Guessable SMTP Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application is configured to use an SMTP server with weak, default, or easily guessable credentials. Attackers can attempt to guess or brute-force these credentials.
    * **Example Actions:**
        * Trying common default usernames and passwords for SMTP servers.
        * Using password dictionaries or brute-force tools to try various password combinations.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the SMTP server. This allows attackers to send emails as the application, potentially for spam, phishing, or further attacks targeting users or even internal systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1. Pass Unsanitized User Input to PHPMailer Functions [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1__pass_unsanitized_user_input_to_phpmailer_functions__high_risk_.md)

**Critical Node: 2.2.1.1. Pass Unsanitized User Input to PHPMailer Functions [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application directly uses user-provided data (e.g., from web forms, APIs) as parameters to PHPMailer functions without proper validation or sanitization. This is a broad category encompassing various input-related vulnerabilities.
    * **Example Actions:**
        * Using unsanitized user input for email recipient addresses, leading to spam or unintended email delivery.
        * Using unsanitized user input for email subjects or bodies, leading to body injection and potential XSS if emails are rendered in a web context.
        * As discussed in 1.1.1, using unsanitized input for email headers, leading to header injection.
    * **Impact:** Header injection, body injection, spamming, phishing, and potentially other vulnerabilities depending on how the unsanitized input is used within PHPMailer and the application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1.1. Misconfigured Web Server or Application Deployment [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_1__misconfigured_web_server_or_application_deployment__critical_node_.md)

**Critical Node: 2.3.1.1. Misconfigured Web Server or Application Deployment [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:**  The web server or application deployment is misconfigured in a way that makes PHPMailer configuration files (or application configuration files containing PHPMailer settings) publicly accessible via the web.
    * **Example Actions:**
        * Accessing configuration files directly through the web server (e.g., `/config/phpmailer.ini`, `/application.yml`).
        * Exploiting directory listing vulnerabilities to browse and find configuration files.
    * **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information, including SMTP credentials, API keys, database passwords, and other application secrets stored in configuration files. This can lead to full application compromise, data breaches, and unauthorized access to connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1.1. Use Older PHPMailer Version with Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_1__use_older_phpmailer_version_with_vulnerable_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

**Critical Node: 3.1.1.1. Use Older PHPMailer Version with Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application uses an outdated version of PHPMailer or an outdated version of PHP itself, which may contain known security vulnerabilities or rely on vulnerable dependencies. While PHPMailer has minimal direct dependencies, vulnerabilities in PHP or indirectly used libraries could still be exploited.
    * **Example Actions:**
        * Exploiting known vulnerabilities in older versions of PHPMailer (if any exist and are relevant to the application's usage).
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in older versions of PHP that PHPMailer relies on.
    * **Impact:**  Depending on the specific vulnerability, the impact can range from Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), to Information Disclosure.  It's crucial to keep PHPMailer and PHP updated to mitigate these risks.
