# Threat Model Analysis for phpmailer/phpmailer

## Threat: [Header Injection Vulnerability](./threats/header_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input fields (e.g., `From`, `To`, `Cc`, `Subject`, custom headers) to inject arbitrary email headers. They might add extra recipients, modify the sender address for phishing, or inject malicious headers to bypass spam filters or inject arbitrary content. This directly exploits how PHPMailer processes header information.
    *   **Impact:** Spoofing email addresses, facilitating phishing attacks, bypassing spam filters, injecting malicious content into emails, potentially leading to malware distribution or further compromise of recipient systems.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Functions responsible for setting email headers, including `setFrom()`, `addAddress()`, `addReplyTo()`, `addCC()`, `addBCC()`, `Subject`, and methods for adding custom headers (`addCustomHeader()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-supplied input that is used in email headers.
        *   Use PHPMailer's built-in methods for adding recipients and headers (`addAddress()`, `addCC()`, `addBCC()`, `addCustomHeader()`) instead of directly concatenating strings.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to set the `From` address; consider using a predefined sender address and the `Reply-To` header for user replies.

## Threat: [Body Injection Vulnerability](./threats/body_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input used for the email body to inject arbitrary content. This directly exploits how PHPMailer handles the email body content.
    *   **Impact:** Delivery of malicious content, phishing attacks, spreading misinformation, damaging the sender's reputation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Functions responsible for setting the email body, primarily `Body` and `AltBody` properties or methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate user-supplied input used for the email body.
        *   Properly encode the email body content, especially when sending HTML emails, to prevent the interpretation of malicious scripts or tags.
        *   Consider using a templating engine to separate content from code and make it easier to sanitize.

## Threat: [Insecure SMTP Connection (Plain Text Authentication)](./threats/insecure_smtp_connection__plain_text_authentication_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic when PHPMailer connects to the SMTP server without encryption (TLS/SSL) and retrieves the SMTP credentials (username and password) transmitted in plain text. This is a direct consequence of PHPMailer's SMTP connection configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of SMTP credentials, allowing the attacker to send emails through the compromised account, potentially leading to further phishing attacks or spam campaigns.
    *   **Affected Component:**  SMTP connection handling, specifically the configuration of `SMTPSecure` and related settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use secure SMTP connections (STARTTLS or SMTPS).
        *   Ensure the `SMTPSecure` property is set to `tls` or `ssl`.
        *   Verify that the SMTP server supports and is configured for secure connections.

## Threat: [Disabled or Improper TLS/SSL Verification](./threats/disabled_or_improper_tlsssl_verification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting the connection to the SMTP server. If PHPMailer's TLS/SSL certificate verification is disabled or improperly configured, the application might connect to a malicious server impersonating the legitimate one, potentially exposing SMTP credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of SMTP credentials, allowing the attacker to send emails through the compromised account.
    *   **Affected Component:** SMTP connection handling, specifically settings related to TLS/SSL verification, potentially within the `SMTPOptions` array.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure TLS/SSL certificate verification is enabled. The default settings in PHPMailer usually enable verification.
        *   If using custom `SMTPOptions`, ensure that settings related to certificate verification are correctly configured.
        *   Keep the operating system's certificate authority (CA) bundle up-to-date.

## Threat: [Exposure of SMTP Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_smtp_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to SMTP credentials if they are directly used within the PHPMailer configuration (e.g., setting `$mail->Username` and `$mail->Password` with hardcoded values).
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of SMTP credentials, allowing the attacker to send emails through the compromised account, potentially leading to further phishing attacks or spam campaigns.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Configuration and storage of SMTP authentication details (`Username` and `Password` properties).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never hardcode SMTP credentials in the application code.
        *   Store SMTP credentials securely using environment variables, a dedicated secrets management system, or encrypted configuration files.
        *   Ensure that configuration files containing sensitive information are not publicly accessible.
        *   Avoid logging SMTP credentials.

## Threat: [Using Vulnerable PHPMailer Version](./threats/using_vulnerable_phpmailer_version.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities present within the PHPMailer library itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or other forms of compromise directly within the email sending process.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The entire PHPMailer library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update PHPMailer to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories related to PHPMailer to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and update library versions.
