## Deep Analysis: PHPMailer Header Injection (CRITICAL)

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the "Header Injection" attack path within an attack tree analysis for an application utilizing the PHPMailer library. This path is classified as "CRITICAL" due to the potentially severe consequences of successful exploitation.

**Vulnerability Description:**

Header injection, in the context of email, occurs when an attacker can inject arbitrary email headers into an email being sent by the application. This happens because the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input that is used to construct email headers. PHPMailer, while providing tools to mitigate this, can be vulnerable if developers don't use its features correctly or rely on unsanitized user input directly for header values.

**Attack Tree Path Breakdown:**

Let's dissect each attack vector within the "Header Injection" path:

**1. Injecting arbitrary email headers by including special characters (like newlines) in user-supplied input used for headers.**

* **Mechanism:**  The core of header injection lies in the way SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) interprets email headers. Headers are separated by newline characters (`\r\n`). By injecting these characters into user-supplied input that is directly used to construct headers (e.g., in the `From`, `To`, `Subject`, or custom headers), an attacker can introduce new, malicious headers.
* **PHPMailer Relevance:** If the application uses user input directly in PHPMailer functions like `setFrom()`, `addAddress()`, `Subject`, or `addCustomHeader()` without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable. For example, if a user-provided name for the "From" address contains `\r\nBcc: attacker@example.com`, a BCC recipient can be added without authorization.
* **Impact:**
    * **Spam/Phishing:** Injecting `Bcc` or `Cc` headers allows attackers to send unsolicited emails or phishing attempts through the application's email infrastructure.
    * **Information Leakage:**  Adding `Bcc` recipients can expose email content to unauthorized individuals.
    * **Bypassing Security Controls:** Attackers might inject headers to bypass spam filters or email authentication mechanisms (though this is becoming increasingly difficult with modern email security).

**Example (Vulnerable Code Snippet):**

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    $user_name = $_POST['user_name']; // User-supplied name
    $user_email = $_POST['user_email']; // User-supplied email
    $subject = "Thank you for your registration";
    $body = "Thank you for registering!";

    $mail->isSMTP();
    $mail->Host       = 'smtp.example.com';
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;
    $mail->Username   = 'your_smtp_username';
    $mail->Password   = 'your_smtp_password';
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS;
    $mail->Port       = 587;

    // Vulnerable: Directly using user input in setFrom
    $mail->setFrom($user_email, $user_name);
    $mail->addAddress('recipient@example.com');
    $mail->Subject = $subject;
    $mail->Body    = $body;

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
?>
```

**If `$_POST['user_name']` contains `Evil User\r\nBcc: attacker@example.com`, the resulting headers will include a BCC recipient.**

**2. Manipulating the `From` header to spoof the sender's identity.**

* **Mechanism:** By injecting newline characters followed by a new `From:` header, an attacker can overwrite the intended sender's address. This allows them to impersonate legitimate users or organizations.
* **PHPMailer Relevance:**  Similar to the previous point, if user input is directly used in `setFrom()` without proper validation, this attack is possible.
* **Impact:**
    * **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can send emails that appear to originate from trusted sources, increasing the likelihood of recipients clicking malicious links or providing sensitive information.
    * **Reputation Damage:** The application's domain or the legitimate sender's domain can be blacklisted due to the malicious activity.
    * **Social Engineering:** Spoofed emails can be used to trick users into performing actions they wouldn't normally take.

**3. Adding `BCC` or `CC` recipients without authorization.**

* **Mechanism:** As demonstrated in the first point, injecting `Bcc:` or `Cc:` headers allows attackers to silently include additional recipients in the email.
* **PHPMailer Relevance:**  This directly relates to the improper handling of user input in header construction.
* **Impact:**
    * **Privacy Violation:**  Sensitive information can be shared with unauthorized individuals.
    * **Compliance Issues:**  Depending on the data being sent, this could violate privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
    * **Internal Espionage:**  Malicious insiders could use this to exfiltrate information.

**4. Modifying the email's routing or delivery path.**

* **Mechanism:**  While less common in typical header injection scenarios targeting PHPMailer, it's theoretically possible to inject headers that influence email routing. This could involve manipulating `Return-Path` or other less common headers.
* **PHPMailer Relevance:**  This would require the application to allow users to control or influence these specific headers, which is less frequent. However, if custom headers are allowed without strict validation, it could be a potential avenue.
* **Impact:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Misdirecting emails could overload other mail servers.
    * **Interception:**  In rare cases, manipulating routing might allow attackers to intercept emails (though this is highly complex and dependent on the mail infrastructure).

**5. Injecting headers that can alter the email's content or formatting in unexpected ways.**

* **Mechanism:** Attackers might inject headers like `Content-Type` or `MIME-Version` to manipulate how the email is rendered by the recipient's email client.
* **PHPMailer Relevance:** If the application allows users to define custom headers without proper validation, attackers could inject these headers.
* **Impact:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Email:** While less direct than web-based XSS, manipulating `Content-Type` could potentially lead to the execution of scripts if the email client is vulnerable.
    * **Display Issues:**  Altering `Content-Type` can cause the email to be displayed incorrectly or not at all.
    * **Bypassing Security Scanners:**  Manipulating the email structure might help bypass some basic email security scanners.

**Mitigation Strategies (Development Team Actions):**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strictly validate all user-supplied input used for email headers.**  Use whitelisting to allow only expected characters and formats.
    * **Sanitize input by removing or escaping newline characters (`\r` and `\n`).**  PHP's `str_replace()` or regular expressions can be used for this.
    * **Avoid directly concatenating user input into header strings.**

* **Utilize PHPMailer's Built-in Security Features:**
    * **Use the `setFrom()` method correctly:**  Provide the email address and the name as separate parameters. PHPMailer will handle the proper formatting and escaping.
    * **Use `addAddress()`, `addCC()`, and `addBCC()` for recipient management.**  These methods are designed to prevent header injection.
    * **Avoid using `addCustomHeader()` with unsanitized user input.** If absolutely necessary, implement rigorous validation and sanitization before using this method.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Email (If Applicable):** While not directly enforced by all email clients, defining a strict CSP can help mitigate potential XSS issues if attackers manage to manipulate the email content.

* **Regularly Update PHPMailer:** Ensure the application is using the latest version of PHPMailer to benefit from security patches and improvements.

* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including header injection flaws.

* **Educate Developers:** Ensure the development team understands the risks associated with header injection and how to prevent it when using PHPMailer.

**Exploitation Scenario Example:**

1. **Attacker identifies a form or API endpoint where user input is used to populate the "From" name field.**
2. **Attacker crafts malicious input containing newline characters and a `Bcc:` header:**  `Evil User\r\nBcc: attacker@example.com`
3. **The application, without proper sanitization, uses this input directly in the `setFrom()` method of PHPMailer.**
4. **PHPMailer constructs the email headers, including the injected `Bcc:` header.**
5. **The email is sent, and a copy is silently sent to `attacker@example.com`.**

**Conclusion:**

Header injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences. The "CRITICAL" classification of this attack path is justified due to the potential for widespread abuse, including phishing, spam, and data breaches. By understanding the mechanisms of this attack and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and protect the application and its users. Focusing on proper input validation and leveraging PHPMailer's built-in security features are crucial steps in preventing this type of attack.
