# Attack Surface Analysis for phpmailer/phpmailer

## Attack Surface: [Email Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/email_header_injection.md)

*   **How PHPMailer Contributes:** PHPMailer allows setting email headers (To, CC, BCC, From, Reply-To, etc.) via its properties and methods. If user-provided data is directly used to populate these headers without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary headers *through PHPMailer's header manipulation functions*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides the following email address: `victim@example.com%0ABCC: attacker@example.com`. If this is used directly in the `$mail->addAddress()` method, it will inject a BCC header.
    *   **Impact:** Sending emails to unintended recipients, spoofing sender addresses, injecting malicious headers (e.g., for spam or phishing), potentially bypassing spam filters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate all user-provided email addresses and other header-related inputs against expected formats *before passing them to PHPMailer's header functions*.
        *   **Header Encoding:** Use PHPMailer's built-in functions or manual encoding to ensure special characters are properly escaped *before setting header values via PHPMailer*.
        *   **Avoid Direct Input:** Avoid directly incorporating user input into header strings *when using PHPMailer's header manipulation methods*. If necessary, use a controlled list of allowed values or patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Message Body Injection (HTML/Script Injection)](./attack_surfaces/message_body_injection__htmlscript_injection_.md)

*   **How PHPMailer Contributes:** PHPMailer allows setting the email body as HTML or plain text using the `$mail->Body` and `$mail->AltBody` properties. If user-provided content is used here without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript *that PHPMailer will then include in the email*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a form field that populates the email body, which is then set using `$mail->Body = $_POST['body'];`.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the email client renders the HTML, phishing attempts by embedding malicious links or forms, displaying misleading or harmful content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTML Sanitization:** Sanitize user-provided HTML content using a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., HTMLPurifier) *before setting the `$mail->Body` property*.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement CSP headers for HTML emails (where supported by email clients) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
        *   **Escape Output:** If displaying user-provided content in the email body, escape HTML entities *before setting it in PHPMailer* to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
        *   **Prefer Plain Text:** When possible, prefer sending emails in plain text format *using PHPMailer's plain text body functionality* to avoid HTML injection risks.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/attachment_path_traversal.md)

*   **How PHPMailer Contributes:** The `$mail->addAttachment()` method takes a file path as input. If this path is directly derived from user input without validation, attackers might be able to access and attach arbitrary files from the server's filesystem *through PHPMailer's file attachment mechanism*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` as the attachment path, which is then used in `$mail->addAttachment($_POST['filepath']);`.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential information disclosure, and potentially unauthorized access to server resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Paths:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed directories from which attachments can be sourced *before passing the path to PHPMailer*.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate user-provided file paths to ensure they are within the expected directory and do not contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) *before using them with PHPMailer's attachment functions*.
        *   **Use File Uploads:**  Instead of directly using user-provided paths, encourage users to upload files, and then store and access those files securely *before attaching them using PHPMailer*.
        *   **Unique Identifiers:** Use unique identifiers for stored files instead of relying on user-provided names or paths *when managing files to be attached with PHPMailer*.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in PHPMailer Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_phpmailer_library_itself.md)

*   **How PHPMailer Contributes:** Like any software, PHPMailer may contain security vulnerabilities within its code. Using an outdated or unpatched version exposes the application to these known flaws *inherent in PHPMailer's implementation*.
    *   **Example:** Using a version of PHPMailer known to have a remote code execution vulnerability, allowing attackers to exploit the flaw *within PHPMailer's processing logic*.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution on the server, information disclosure, or other security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for known RCE vulnerabilities), High (for other significant vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep PHPMailer Updated:** Regularly update PHPMailer to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities *within the library itself*.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Composer) to manage PHPMailer and easily update it.
        *   **Security Audits:** Periodically review the application's dependencies and conduct security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities *within PHPMailer and other components*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure SMTP Connection](./attack_surfaces/insecure_smtp_connection.md)

*   **How PHPMailer Contributes:** PHPMailer allows configuring the SMTP connection, including whether to use encryption (TLS/SSL) via its properties. If encryption is not enforced *in PHPMailer's configuration*, communication with the SMTP server is vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** The PHPMailer configuration uses `$mail->SMTPSecure = '';` or `$mail->SMTPAutoTLS = false;` on a public network, leading to unencrypted communication *handled by PHPMailer*.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks could intercept email content, including sensitive information and potentially SMTP credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Always configure PHPMailer to use secure SMTP connections by setting `$mail->SMTPSecure = 'tls'` or `$mail->SMTPSecure = 'ssl'` *within the PHPMailer setup*.
        *   **Enable SMTP Authentication:** Ensure SMTP authentication is enabled on the server and used in PHPMailer's configuration.
        *   **Verify SSL Certificates:** Ensure PHPMailer is configured to verify the SSL certificate of the SMTP server (avoid disabling certificate verification in production *within PHPMailer's settings*).
