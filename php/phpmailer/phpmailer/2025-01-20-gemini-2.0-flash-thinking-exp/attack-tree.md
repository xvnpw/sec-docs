## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit PHPMailer Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_phpmailer_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Identify and Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE, XSS) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify the specific version of PHPMailer used by the application. They then search public vulnerability databases (like CVE) and exploit databases for known vulnerabilities affecting that version. If a suitable vulnerability exists (e.g., Remote Code Execution or Cross-Site Scripting), they craft specific payloads designed to trigger the vulnerability and compromise the application or its users.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific PHPMailer version might allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code through a specially crafted email header, leading to the execution of malicious commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse PHPMailer Features/Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_phpmailer_featuresmisconfigurations.md)

*   **Header Injection [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the lack of proper input sanitization in the application when constructing email headers using PHPMailer. By injecting newline characters and additional header fields, they can manipulate the email's routing and content.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Injecting arbitrary "To", "Cc", or "Bcc" recipients to send spam or phishing emails using the application's infrastructure.
        *   Injecting an arbitrary "From" address to spoof the sender's identity for phishing or social engineering attacks.
        *   Injecting an arbitrary "Reply-To" address to redirect replies to an attacker-controlled address.
*   **Body Injection [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to header injection, attackers exploit the lack of input sanitization when constructing the email body. They inject malicious content into the body of the email.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Injecting HTML with malicious JavaScript that executes in the recipient's email client (if the email is rendered as HTML), potentially leading to account takeover or data theft.
        *   Injecting phishing links that redirect users to malicious websites to steal credentials or install malware.
*   **Send Malicious Attachments [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the application's attachment functionality to send malicious files to recipients. This often relies on the application allowing arbitrary file uploads without proper validation or scanning.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Uploading and sending executable files (e.g., `.exe`, `.bat`) containing malware to infect the recipient's system.
        *   Uploading and sending documents (e.g., `.doc`, `.xls`) with malicious macros that execute harmful code when the document is opened.
*   **Abuse SMTP Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Exploit Insecure SMTP Settings (Application-Side) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit insecure configurations in how the application connects to the SMTP server using PHPMailer.
        *   **Example:** Using weak or default SMTP credentials allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the mail server and send emails directly, bypassing the application's intended use.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Integration with PHPMailer](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_integration_with_phpmailer.md)

*   **Insecure Input Handling [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Supply Malicious Input to PHPMailer Parameters:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** This is a fundamental vulnerability where the application directly passes user-supplied data (e.g., from web forms) to PHPMailer functions without proper validation or sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious content into email headers, bodies, or attachment paths.
        *   **Example:** If the application uses user input directly for the recipient's email address without sanitization, an attacker could inject additional recipients through header injection. Similarly, unsanitized input used for the email body can lead to body injection attacks.
