# Threat Model Analysis for phpmailer/phpmailer

## Threat: [Header Injection](./threats/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit the way PHPMailer processes header information. By injecting newline characters (`\r\n`) followed by malicious header fields into input passed to PHPMailer's header-related methods, they can manipulate email headers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Spamming:** Adding BCC recipients to send unsolicited emails.
    *   **Spoofing:** Modifying the "From" address to impersonate others.
    *   **Bypassing Spam Filters:** Adding headers to circumvent detection.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Forwarding or copying emails to unintended recipients.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `PHPMailer` class, specifically methods like `addAddress`, `addCC`, `addBCC`, `setFrom`, and `addCustomHeader`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize PHPMailer's built-in escaping mechanisms (if available and applicable).**
    *   **Sanitize input before passing it to PHPMailer's header-related methods by removing or escaping newline characters.**

## Threat: [Attachment Path Traversal](./threats/attachment_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide manipulated file paths to PHPMailer's `addAttachment` method, potentially accessing and attaching arbitrary files from the server's file system if PHPMailer doesn't perform sufficient path validation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Files:** Leaking configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Unintentional sharing of internal documents.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `PHPMailer` class, specifically the `addAttachment` method.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid directly using user-provided paths with `addAttachment`.**
    *   **If user input is involved, strictly validate and sanitize file paths before passing them to `addAttachment`.**
    *   **Consider using a whitelist of allowed attachment directories.**

## Threat: [Insecure SMTP Configuration](./threats/insecure_smtp_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** PHPMailer is configured to use insecure SMTP settings, such as connecting without TLS/SSL encryption or using plain text authentication, making the communication vulnerable to interception.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** SMTP credentials can be intercepted if the connection is not encrypted.
    *   **Eavesdropping:** Email content can be intercepted and read during transmission.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `PHPMailer` class, specifically properties and methods related to SMTP configuration (`SMTPAuth`, `Username`, `Password`, `SMTPSecure`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always configure PHPMailer to use `SMTPSecure = 'tls'` or `SMTPSecure = 'ssl'`.**
    *   **Ensure `SMTPAuth = true` and use strong, unique passwords for SMTP accounts.**
    *   **Consider using OAuth 2.0 for authentication if supported by the mail server.**

## Threat: [Using Outdated PHPMailer Version](./threats/using_outdated_phpmailer_version.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of PHPMailer that contains known security vulnerabilities within its code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the outdated version to compromise the email sending process or potentially the application itself.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   The entire `PHPMailer` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerabilities)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update PHPMailer to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.**
    *   **Monitor security advisories related to PHPMailer.**
