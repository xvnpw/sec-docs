# Threat Model Analysis for phpmailer/phpmailer

## Threat: [Email Header Injection (SMTP Smuggling)](./threats/email_header_injection__smtp_smuggling_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input containing newline characters (`\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`) and other special characters within fields intended for email headers (e.g., recipient addresses, subject, sender). They inject additional headers (like `Bcc` to send copies to themselves) or even entire SMTP commands, bypassing the intended email flow and potentially gaining control over the email sending process. This is a direct attack against how PHPMailer handles user-supplied data for email headers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized sending of spam/phishing emails.
    *   Bypassing of email security filters.
    *   Sender address spoofing.
    *   Potential unauthorized access to email accounts (in severe SMTP smuggling cases).
    *   Reputational damage and legal consequences.
*   **Affected PHPMailer Component:**
    *   `addAddress()`
    *   `addCC()`
    *   `addBCC()`
    *   `addReplyTo()`
    *   `Subject` property
    *   `From` property
    *   `FromName` property
    *   Any method or property that directly sets email headers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate all user-supplied input used in email headers against a strict whitelist of allowed characters. Reject any input containing newline characters or other potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Email Address Validation:** Use a dedicated email validation library (like `egulias/email-validator`) to ensure email addresses conform to RFC specifications.
    *   **Encode/Escape Special Characters:** If newline characters are absolutely necessary (highly unlikely in email addresses), ensure they are properly encoded or escaped before being passed to PHPMailer.
    *   **Use PHPMailer's Methods:** Utilize PHPMailer's built-in methods (e.g., `addAddress()`) which *should* perform some sanitization, but *do not rely on them solely*. Always validate input *before* passing it to these methods.

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Inclusion via Attachments](./threats/arbitrary_file_inclusion_via_attachments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious file path (e.g., `../../etc/passwd` or a path to an uploaded PHP script) to a PHPMailer function that handles attachments. If the application doesn't validate this path *before passing it to PHPMailer*, PHPMailer might include and potentially execute the attacker's file. This is a direct threat because it exploits how PHPMailer handles file paths for attachments.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) – allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.
    *   Information Disclosure – revealing sensitive files and data.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) – by including large or resource-intensive files.
*   **Affected PHPMailer Component:**
    *   `addAttachment()`
    *   `addStringAttachment()`
    *   `addEmbeddedImage()`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Trust User Input for File Paths:** Do *not* allow users to directly specify file paths.
    *   **Controlled Attachment Storage:** Store attachments in a designated, non-web-accessible directory with unique, randomly generated filenames.
    *   **Whitelist File Extensions:** Only allow specific, safe file extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.png`).
    *   **Validate MIME Types (with Caution):** Check the MIME type of uploaded files, but *do not rely on it solely* as it can be spoofed. Combine with file extension whitelisting.
    *   **File Content Scanning:** Scan uploaded files for malicious content using a virus scanner or other security tools.

## Threat: [Exploitation of PHPMailer Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_phpmailer_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the PHPMailer library itself or its dependencies. This is a direct threat to the library's code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Affected PHPMailer Component:**
    *   Potentially any part of the PHPMailer library or its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep PHPMailer Updated:** Regularly update PHPMailer to the latest version using a dependency manager (like Composer).
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor security advisories related to PHPMailer and its dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in your application and its dependencies.

## Threat: [`mail()` Function Command Injection (if used)](./threats/_mail____function_command_injection__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If PHPMailer is configured to use PHP's `mail()` function (`Mailer = 'mail'`) *and* the fifth parameter (additional parameters) is used without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject arbitrary commands to be executed by the underlying `sendmail` program. This is a direct threat when PHPMailer is explicitly configured to use the vulnerable `mail()` function in a specific, unsafe way.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   System compromise.
*   **Affected PHPMailer Component:**
    *   `Mailer` property (set to `'mail'`)
    *   Indirectly, any part of PHPMailer that uses the `mail()` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prefer SMTP:** Use direct SMTP (`Mailer = 'smtp';`) instead of the `mail()` function whenever possible.
    *   **Avoid Fifth Parameter:** If using `mail()`, avoid using the fifth parameter if possible.
    *   **Strict Sanitization:** If the fifth parameter *must* be used, sanitize it *extremely* thoroughly to prevent command injection. This is a very high-risk area. Consider a whitelist approach, allowing only specific, known-safe parameters.
