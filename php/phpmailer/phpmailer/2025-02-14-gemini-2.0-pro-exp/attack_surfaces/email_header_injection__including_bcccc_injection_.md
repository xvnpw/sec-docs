## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Email Header Injection

### 2.1. Vulnerability Description

Email Header Injection, also known as Email Injection or SMTP Header Injection, occurs when an attacker can inject malicious email headers into an email message generated by an application.  This is typically achieved by exploiting insufficient input validation on user-supplied data that is used to construct email headers.  The most common injection point is through newline characters (`\r` - CR, `\n` - LF, or `\r\n` - CRLF), which are used to separate headers in the SMTP protocol.

### 2.2. PHPMailer's Role and Contribution

PHPMailer, while a powerful and widely-used library, is *not* inherently vulnerable to Email Header Injection.  The vulnerability arises from *how the application uses* PHPMailer.  PHPMailer provides functions to set email headers, and if these functions are fed with unsanitized user input, the application becomes vulnerable.

**Key PHPMailer functions involved (and how they can be misused):**

*   **`$mail->setFrom($address, $name)`:**  Sets the "From" address and name.  If `$address` or `$name` contains newline characters followed by malicious headers, those headers will be injected.
*   **`$mail->addAddress($address, $name)`:**  Adds a recipient.  Similar vulnerability as `setFrom()`.
*   **`$mail->addReplyTo($address, $name)`:**  Sets the "Reply-To" address.  Same vulnerability.
*   **`$mail->addCC($address, $name)`:**  Adds a "Cc" recipient.  Same vulnerability.
*   **`$mail->addBCC($address, $name)`:**  Adds a "Bcc" recipient.  Same vulnerability.
*   **`$mail->Subject = $subject;`:**  Sets the email subject.  While less common, newline injection here can also lead to header injection.
*   **`$mail->addCustomHeader($headerLine)`:**  This function is *particularly dangerous* if used with user input. It allows adding arbitrary header lines, making it a prime target for injection.

**Crucially, PHPMailer *does* perform some internal escaping, but this escaping is designed to handle valid email addresses and names, *not* to prevent header injection attacks.**  It's the developer's responsibility to ensure that the data passed to these functions is free of malicious header injection attempts.

### 2.3. Attack Vectors and Examples

**Example 1:  BCC Injection via "Your Name" field**

```php
// Vulnerable Code
$userName = $_POST['your_name']; // User input:  "John Doe\nBcc: spam@example.com"
$mail->setFrom('noreply@example.com', $userName);
$mail->addAddress('recipient@example.com');
$mail->Subject = 'Welcome!';
$mail->Body = '...';
$mail->send();
```

In this case, the attacker provides `John Doe\nBcc: spam@example.com` as their name.  The newline character causes PHPMailer to treat `Bcc: spam@example.com` as a separate header, adding a hidden BCC recipient.

**Example 2:  Subject and Header Manipulation**

```php
// Vulnerable Code
$subject = $_POST['subject']; // User input: "Normal Subject\nX-Spam-Flag: YES"
$mail->Subject = $subject;
$mail->addAddress('recipient@example.com');
$mail->Body = '...';
$mail->send();
```
Here attacker can inject custom headers.

**Example 3:  `addCustomHeader()` Misuse**

```php
// Vulnerable Code
$customHeader = $_POST['custom_header']; // User input: "X-My-Header: Value\nBcc: spam@example.com"
$mail->addCustomHeader($customHeader);
$mail->addAddress('recipient@example.com');
$mail->Subject = 'Welcome!';
$mail->Body = '...';
$mail->send();
```

This is the most direct way to inject headers, as `addCustomHeader()` is designed to add raw header lines.

### 2.4. Impact and Risk Severity

As stated, the risk severity is **Critical**.  The impact includes:

*   **Spam and Phishing:**  The application can be used to send unsolicited emails, damaging the sender's reputation and potentially leading to legal issues.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can leak email addresses of other users by injecting BCC headers.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  Emails sent from the compromised application may be flagged as spam, affecting deliverability for legitimate emails.
*   **Account Takeover (in some cases):**  If the attacker can control the "From" address, they might be able to initiate password reset requests or other actions that rely on email verification.

### 2.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

**1. Strict Input Validation (Whitelist Approach - Preferred):**

*   **Define allowed characters:**  For each input field that will be used in an email header, create a whitelist of allowed characters.  For example, for a "name" field, you might allow letters, spaces, and a limited set of punctuation (e.g., `.`, `-`, `'`).
*   **Reject invalid input:**  If the input contains any characters *not* on the whitelist, reject it entirely.  Do *not* attempt to "clean" the input by removing invalid characters; this can be error-prone.
*   **Example (PHP):**

    ```php
    function validateName($name) {
        if (preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z\s.\-\']+$/', $name)) {
            return $name;
        } else {
            return false; // Or throw an exception
        }
    }

    $userName = $_POST['your_name'];
    $validatedName = validateName($userName);

    if ($validatedName) {
        $mail->setFrom('noreply@example.com', $validatedName);
        // ... rest of the email sending code ...
    } else {
        // Handle the error (e.g., display an error message to the user)
    }
    ```

**2. Input Sanitization (Blacklist Approach - Less Preferred, but acceptable if whitelist is not possible):**

*   **Remove newline characters:**  At a minimum, remove all occurrences of `\r`, `\n`, and `\r\n` from the input *before* passing it to PHPMailer.
*   **Example (PHP):**

    ```php
    $userName = $_POST['your_name'];
    $sanitizedName = str_replace(array("\r", "\n"), '', $userName);
    $mail->setFrom('noreply@example.com', $sanitizedName);
    // ... rest of the email sending code ...
    ```
    This is less secure than whitelisting, as it's harder to anticipate all possible malicious input.

**3. Correct Use of PHPMailer's API (Essential):**

*   **Always use dedicated methods:**  Use `$mail->addAddress()`, `$mail->addReplyTo()`, `$mail->setFrom()`, `$mail->Subject = ...`, etc., to set header values.  These methods are designed to handle the specific formatting requirements of each header.
*   **Avoid direct concatenation:**  *Never* build header strings manually by concatenating user input.  This bypasses any internal escaping that PHPMailer might perform.

**4. Avoid `addCustomHeader()` with User Input (or Sanitize Extremely Thoroughly):**

*   **Strong preference:**  Avoid using `addCustomHeader()` with any data that originates from user input.
*   **If unavoidable:**  If you *must* use `addCustomHeader()` with user input, apply *both* whitelisting and newline removal, and consider additional escaping specific to the header you're adding.  This is a high-risk area, so proceed with extreme caution.

**5. Encoding:**

*   Use consistent encoding (UTF-8 is recommended) throughout your application and within PHPMailer: `$mail->CharSet = 'UTF-8';`

**6.  Regular Updates:**

*   Keep PHPMailer updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches.

**7.  Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

*   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including Email Header Injection.

## 3. Conclusion

Email Header Injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences.  By understanding how PHPMailer interacts with email headers and by implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can effectively protect their applications from this attack.
