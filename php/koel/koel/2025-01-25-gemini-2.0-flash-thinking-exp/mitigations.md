# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for koel/koel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation for Media File Uploads (Koel Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_for_media_file_uploads__koel_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Koel Supported File Types:**  Within Koel's upload functionality, strictly validate uploaded files against the audio formats Koel is designed to handle (MP3, FLAC, AAC, etc.).  Reject any other file types at the server level within Koel's upload processing logic.
    *   **Step 2: Koel Filename Context:** Sanitize filenames specifically within Koel's file handling routines.  Consider how Koel uses filenames for display, storage, and database entries, and sanitize to prevent issues in these Koel-specific contexts. Focus on characters that could be problematic within Koel's internal operations.
    *   **Step 3: Koel Metadata Handling:** When Koel processes audio metadata (ID3 tags, etc.), use libraries within Koel's backend that are secure and designed for audio metadata parsing. Sanitize metadata specifically before it's used in Koel's frontend display or database storage to prevent issues within Koel's application logic.
    *   **Step 4: Koel Resource Limits:** Configure file size limits within Koel's upload settings or server-side processing to prevent resource exhaustion specifically related to Koel's media handling capabilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (High Severity):** Through malicious file uploads exploiting vulnerabilities in Koel's media processing or filename handling *specifically within Koel's code*.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Via malicious metadata injected into audio files, potentially executed when Koel displays this metadata in its user interface.
        *   **Directory Traversal (Medium Severity):** Through crafted filenames attempting to access files outside the intended upload directory *when processed by Koel's file handling*.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** By uploading excessively large files or files designed to consume excessive processing resources *within Koel's media processing pipeline*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing execution of arbitrary code through file uploads *within Koel's application*.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Moderately reduces risk by sanitizing metadata, minimizing the chance of injecting and executing malicious scripts *within Koel's frontend*.
        *   **Directory Traversal:** Significantly reduces risk by sanitizing filenames and preventing access to unauthorized file paths *during Koel's file operations*.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Moderately reduces risk by limiting file sizes and preventing resource exhaustion from large uploads *affecting Koel's performance*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Partially Implemented:** Laravel framework (Koel's base) provides some input handling, but Koel's specific media processing and upload logic needs dedicated checks.
        *   **File type validation:** Likely present to some extent within Koel's upload flow, but needs review for Koel-specific file types and robustness.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Detailed Metadata Validation within Koel:** Specific validation and sanitization of audio metadata (ID3 tags) *within Koel's backend code* might be missing or insufficient.
        *   **Robust Filename Sanitization for Koel Context:** Review and strengthen filename sanitization logic *specifically considering how Koel uses filenames*.
        *   **Koel Specific Error Handling:** Implement error handling within Koel's upload and media processing to gracefully handle invalid files and prevent information leakage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Media File Storage and Access (Koel Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_media_file_storage_and_access__koel_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Koel Storage Location:** Ensure Koel is configured to store uploaded media files outside of the web server's document root, preventing direct web access *to Koel's media library*. Verify Koel's configuration settings enforce this.
    *   **Step 2: Koel Access Control Logic:** Implement access control mechanisms *within Koel's application logic* to manage access to media files.  Koel should verify user authentication and authorization before allowing streaming or download of media. Review Koel's authorization checks for media access.
    *   **Step 3: Koel Unique Filenames:**  Koel should generate unique, non-predictable filenames when storing media files *within its storage system*. Review the filename generation logic used by Koel.
    *   **Step 4: Koel File System Permissions:** Configure file system permissions on the media storage directory *used by Koel*. Ensure only the Koel application process (and necessary system users) have appropriate access.
    *   **Step 5: Koel Streaming Security:**  Review Koel's media streaming implementation. Ensure Koel performs authorization checks *before serving media streams* and uses secure streaming methods.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data (High Severity):**  Direct access to Koel's media files by unauthenticated or unauthorized users, bypassing Koel's access controls.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Exposure of Koel's media library file paths or directory structure if files are stored insecurely or filenames are predictable *within Koel's storage*.
        *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** In case of a wider vulnerability in Koel, insecure storage could lead to mass download of Koel's media files.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing direct web access and enforcing access control *within Koel*.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Moderately reduces risk by using non-predictable filenames and storing files outside the web root *in Koel's context*.
        *   **Data Breach:** Significantly reduces risk by limiting access points to Koel's application logic and making mass data extraction more difficult.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Likely Implemented (Out-of-Webroot Storage):** Koel, as a Laravel app, likely defaults to storing uploads outside the web root. Configuration verification needed.
        *   **Access Control:** Koel's user authentication likely provides basic access control, but media file access control *within Koel's code* needs verification.
        *   **Unique Filenames:**  Likely implemented in Koel, but randomness and unpredictability of filename generation *within Koel's logic* should be reviewed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Granular Access Control within Koel:**  Review and enhance access control mechanisms *specifically within Koel's media serving logic* to ensure robustness.
        *   **Security Audit of Koel Storage and Access Logic:** Conduct a security audit focused on Koel's media file storage and access control *code*.

    *   **Step 2: Authorization Checks (Koel API):** Enforce authorization checks on every Koel API endpoint. Verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions *within Koel's permission system* to perform the requested action. Review Koel's authorization logic for its API.
    *   **Step 3: Rate Limiting (Koel API):** Implement rate limiting on Koel's API endpoints to prevent abuse and DoS attacks *specifically targeting Koel's API*. Configure rate limits appropriate for Koel's expected usage.
    *   **Step 4: Koel API Authentication:** Use secure authentication mechanisms for accessing Koel's API. For frontend-to-backend, session-based authentication (Laravel's default in Koel) is likely used. For external API integrations (if Koel supports them), review and secure those authentication methods.
    *   **Step 5: Koel API Documentation Security Review:** Maintain up-to-date API documentation for Koel, including security considerations *specific to Koel's API*. Conduct security reviews of Koel's API endpoints.
