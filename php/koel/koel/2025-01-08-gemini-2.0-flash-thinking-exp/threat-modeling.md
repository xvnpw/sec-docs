    - **User:** Ensure the Koel server is running with minimal necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Insecure Media File Storage leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/insecure_media_file_storage_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

- **Description:** Koel stores uploaded media files in a location that is directly accessible via the web server *due to Koel's configuration or lack of access controls within the application*.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized users can directly download and access all the media files stored on the Koel server, potentially including sensitive or private audio content.
- **Affected Component:** Media Storage, Web Server Configuration *as it relates to Koel's setup*.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developer:** Ensure that the media storage directory is not directly accessible via the web server *by default in Koel's configuration*.
    - **Developer:** Implement access controls within the Koel application to serve media files only to authenticated and authorized users.
    - **User:** Configure the web server to restrict direct access to the media storage directory.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Media Processing Libraries](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_media_processing_libraries.md)

- **Description:** Koel relies on third-party libraries for media processing tasks. These libraries may contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers if Koel doesn't keep them updated.
- **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to RCE, DoS, or information disclosure.
