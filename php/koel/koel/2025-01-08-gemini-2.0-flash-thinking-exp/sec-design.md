## 7. Security Considerations (Focus for Threat Modeling)

This section highlights potential areas of security concern, providing specific examples relevant for threat modeling.

* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Threat:** Brute-force attacks on login forms to guess user credentials.
    * **Threat:** Weak password policies leading to easily compromised accounts.
    * **Threat:** Insecure storage of user credentials in the database (e.g., not using strong hashing algorithms).
    * **Threat:** Privilege escalation vulnerabilities allowing users to access resources they shouldn't.
* **Input Validation:**
    * **Threat:** SQL injection vulnerabilities through unsanitized user input in database queries.
    * **Threat:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by injecting malicious scripts into input fields that are later displayed to other users.
    * **Threat:** Command injection vulnerabilities if user input is used to construct system commands.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Threat:** Stored XSS vulnerabilities where malicious scripts are stored in the database (e.g., in playlist names) and executed when other users view the content.
    * **Threat:** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities where malicious scripts are injected into URLs and executed when a user clicks the link.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    * **Threat:** Attackers tricking authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the Koel application without their knowledge.
* **Data Security:**
    * **Threat:** Unauthorized access to the database, potentially exposing sensitive user data and music metadata.
    * **Threat:** Data breaches during transmission if HTTPS is not properly implemented or configured.
    * **Threat:** Insecure storage of sensitive data in logs or temporary files.
* **File System Security:**
    * **Threat:** Unauthorized access to the music library directory, potentially allowing attackers to download, modify, or delete audio files.
    * **Threat:** Path traversal vulnerabilities allowing access to files outside the intended music library directory.
* **API Security:**
    * **Threat:** API endpoints being accessed without proper authentication or authorization.
    * **Threat:** Denial-of-service attacks by flooding API endpoints with requests.
    * **Threat:** Data exposure through API endpoints returning more information than necessary.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * **Threat:** Using outdated libraries or frameworks with known security vulnerabilities.
* **Error Handling:**
    * **Threat:** Information leakage through overly detailed error messages that reveal sensitive system information.

## 8. Assumptions and Constraints

* The design is based on the publicly available information in the Koel GitHub repository and general web application architecture principles.
* Specific implementation details and configurations may vary depending on the deployment environment.
* This document focuses on the core functionalities and does not cover all possible features, edge cases, or third-party integrations.
* The threat modeling process will utilize this design to identify specific vulnerabilities and is a separate, subsequent activity.

## 9. Future Considerations

* **Scalability:** Strategies for scaling the application to handle a growing number of users and a larger music library (e.g., load balancing, database sharding).
* **Performance Optimization:** Techniques for improving the performance of audio streaming and library browsing (e.g., caching, content delivery networks).
* **Security Enhancements:** Implementation of advanced security features such as multi-factor authentication, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits.
* **Feature Expansion:** Potential future features like podcast support, integration with music streaming services, or mobile applications.
