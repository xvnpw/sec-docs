# Attack Surface Analysis for koel/koel

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Music Metadata](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_music_metadata.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Music Metadata
    *   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into music metadata (like artist, title, album) and stored in the database. When this metadata is displayed in the Koel web interface, the script executes in the user's browser.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** Koel relies on displaying user-provided or externally sourced metadata without proper sanitization on the backend before rendering it in the frontend.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a song with the artist name set to `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views this song, the alert box appears.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking, cookie theft), redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Koel interface for other users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust input sanitization on the backend when processing music metadata.
        *   **Developer:** Use context-aware output encoding when rendering metadata in the web interface (e.g., escaping HTML entities).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) related to Media or Playlists](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__related_to_media_or_playlists.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) related to Media or Playlists
    *   **Description:** The application uses predictable or easily guessable IDs to access resources like music files or playlists. An attacker can manipulate these IDs to access resources belonging to other users.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** If Koel uses sequential or easily enumerable IDs for accessing media files or playlists in API requests or URLs, it becomes vulnerable to IDOR.
    *   **Example:** A user's playlist can be accessed via a URL like `/playlist/123`. An attacker might try changing the ID to `/playlist/124` to access another user's playlist.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to other users' music libraries or playlists, potentially revealing sensitive information or allowing manipulation of their data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement authorization checks on the backend to verify that the user has permission to access the requested resource.
        *   **Developer:** Use non-sequential, unpredictable, and sufficiently long IDs (UUIDs or hashes) for resources.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Koel-Specific Queries](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_koel-specific_queries.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Koel-Specific Queries
    *   **Description:**  Malicious SQL code can be injected into input fields that are used in database queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate the database.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** If Koel's backend code constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided input (e.g., in search functionality or when filtering media), it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Example:** An attacker enters `' OR '1'='1` in a search field, potentially bypassing authentication or retrieving all data from a table.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (access to sensitive user data, music metadata), data manipulation, potential for remote code execution on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. This prevents user input from being interpreted as SQL code.
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious characters from being passed to the database.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities during Media Access](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_during_media_access.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities during Media Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths provided to the application to access files outside of the intended media library directory.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** If Koel doesn't properly sanitize or validate file paths when retrieving or serving media files, it could allow attackers to access arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a request with a file path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to try and access the system's password file.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (access to sensitive system files), potential for remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for file paths.
        *   **Developer:** Use absolute paths or a whitelist of allowed directories for accessing media files.
        *   **Developer:** Avoid allowing users to directly specify file paths.

## Attack Surface: [Potential for Command Injection via Media Processing](./attack_surfaces/potential_for_command_injection_via_media_processing.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Potential for Command Injection via Media Processing
    *   **Description:** If Koel uses external tools or system commands to process media files (e.g., for extracting metadata or generating thumbnails), and user-controlled input is not properly sanitized before being passed to these commands, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:**  Koel might rely on external utilities for tasks like metadata extraction or transcoding, and if the integration isn't secure, it opens this attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a music file with specially crafted metadata that, when processed by an external tool, executes a malicious command on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Avoid using system calls with user-provided input whenever possible.
        *   **Developer:** If system calls are necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization.
        *   **Developer:** Consider using safer alternatives or libraries for media processing that don't involve direct system calls.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Koel](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_koel.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by Koel
    *   **Description:** Koel relies on various third-party PHP libraries. If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, Koel becomes vulnerable as well.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** Koel's functionality depends on these libraries, inheriting any vulnerabilities they might have.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable version of a library used for image processing could allow an attacker to upload a specially crafted image to gain remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the library (remote code execution, denial of service, data breach).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Regularly update all dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   **Developer:** Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
        *   **Developer:** Employ security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Leading to Information Disclosure or Compromise](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_leading_to_information_disclosure_or_compromise.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Configuration Leading to Information Disclosure or Compromise
    *   **Description:** Improperly configured settings can expose sensitive information or create security weaknesses.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** Koel's configuration files might contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or overly permissive settings.
    *   **Example:**  Database credentials stored in plain text in a publicly accessible configuration file.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database or other sensitive resources, potential for full system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Store sensitive configuration data securely (e.g., using environment variables or encrypted configuration files).
        *   **Developer:** Ensure proper file permissions are set for configuration files to restrict access.
        *   **Developer:** Avoid using default or weak credentials for administrative accounts or database access.
