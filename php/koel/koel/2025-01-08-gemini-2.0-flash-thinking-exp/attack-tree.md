## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in Koel's code where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**How it Works:**
* **Via Search Parameters:** An attacker crafts malicious input within search queries (e.g., in the Koel interface or through API calls) that, when processed by the database, executes unintended SQL commands. This can allow them to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, or even modify database records.
* **Via Metadata Update Forms:** Similarly, attackers can inject malicious SQL code into metadata fields (like artist, album, or title) when updating song information. This injected code is then stored in the database and potentially executed when the metadata is retrieved and displayed or used in other database operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit flaws in Koel's handling of uploaded files or its media processing capabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**How it Works:**
* **Exploit vulnerabilities in file upload functionality:**
    * An attacker uploads a file disguised as a legitimate music file (e.g., with a valid extension) but containing malicious code, such as PHP scripts. If Koel doesn't properly validate the file content or stores the uploaded file in a location accessible by the web server, the attacker can then access this malicious file through a web request, causing the server to execute the embedded code.
* **Exploit vulnerabilities in media processing libraries:**
    * Attackers craft malicious media files (e.g., MP3s with specially crafted ID3 tags) that exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries Koel uses to process these files. When Koel attempts to read the metadata or process the file, the vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages served by the application, which is then executed by other users' browsers.

**How it Works:**
* **Stored XSS via metadata fields:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into metadata fields (artist, album, title). This code is then stored in the database. When other users view pages displaying this metadata (e.g., song listings, album details), their browsers execute the malicious script. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on their behalf.
* **Reflected XSS via search parameters or API endpoints:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within a search parameter or API request. When a user clicks on this link or the application processes the malicious API request, the server reflects the malicious script back in the response. The user's browser then executes this script.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Koel's Libraries [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_koel's_libraries__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and frameworks that Koel relies upon (e.g., Laravel, specific media processing libraries).

**How it Works:**
* Attackers identify publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Koel's dependencies. If Koel is using an outdated or vulnerable version of a library, attackers can leverage existing exploits for those vulnerabilities. The impact can range from remote code execution to cross-site scripting, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to Koel's administrative interface using default usernames and passwords that were not changed during the initial setup.

**How it Works:**
* Many applications, including Koel, come with default administrative credentials for initial setup. If the administrator fails to change these credentials, attackers can easily find them through public documentation or by trying common default combinations. Successful login with default credentials grants the attacker full administrative control over the Koel instance, allowing them to manage users, media, and potentially even execute commands on the underlying server.
