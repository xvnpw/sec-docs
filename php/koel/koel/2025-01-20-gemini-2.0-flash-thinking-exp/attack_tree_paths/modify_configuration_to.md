### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. Modify configuration to Inject malicious code or scripts [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This top-level attack vector focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that allow an attacker to modify Koel's configuration files. Successful modification can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**4.1.1. Attack Flow:**

1. **Gain Unauthorized Access:** The attacker needs to gain access to the server's filesystem where Koel's configuration files are stored. This could be achieved through various means:
    * **Exploiting vulnerabilities in other services:**  Compromising other applications running on the same server.
    * **Compromised credentials:** Obtaining legitimate credentials for the server or the Koel application itself.
    * **Local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities:** If Koel or its dependencies have LFI vulnerabilities, attackers might be able to read and potentially manipulate configuration files.
    * **Social engineering:** Tricking administrators into revealing sensitive information or performing malicious actions.
    * **Physical access:** In some scenarios, physical access to the server could be a possibility.

2. **Locate Configuration Files:** Once access is gained, the attacker needs to identify the relevant configuration files. For Koel, this would likely include:
    * `.env`:  This file typically stores sensitive information like database credentials, application keys, and other environment variables.
    * Configuration files within the `config/` directory: These files might contain settings related to application behavior and potentially be targets for code injection.

3. **Modify Configuration Files:** The attacker will then modify the identified configuration files to inject malicious code. This could involve:
    * **Adding malicious PHP code:** Injecting PHP code directly into configuration files that are processed by the application. This could be done by appending code to existing settings or creating new settings.
    * **Modifying existing settings to execute code:**  Altering existing configuration values in a way that, when processed by the application, leads to code execution. This might involve exploiting insecure deserialization or other vulnerabilities.
    * **Introducing new configuration settings:** Adding new configuration parameters that are specifically designed to execute malicious code when the application reads them.

4. **Trigger Code Execution:**  The injected code will be executed when Koel processes the modified configuration files. This typically happens during application startup or when specific functionalities that rely on the modified configuration are triggered.

**4.1.2. Prerequisites:**

* **Vulnerability allowing file system access:**  A weakness in the system or application that grants the attacker access to the server's filesystem.
* **Knowledge of configuration file locations:** The attacker needs to know where Koel stores its configuration files.
* **Write permissions to configuration files:** The attacker's access must have sufficient permissions to modify the target configuration files.
* **Application processes configuration files:** Koel must process the modified configuration files for the injected code to be executed.

**4.1.3. Potential Impact:**

* **Complete server compromise:**  Successful code injection can grant the attacker full control over the server, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, and pivot to other systems.
* **Data breach:** Access to the server allows the attacker to steal sensitive data stored by Koel, including user information, music library details, and potentially database backups.
* **Service disruption:** The attacker could modify the application to cause denial of service, making Koel unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Malware distribution:** The compromised server could be used to host and distribute malware to other users or systems.
* **Reputational damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the application and its developers.

**4.1.4. Detection Methods:**

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Tools that monitor changes to critical files, including configuration files, can detect unauthorized modifications.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitoring system and application behavior for unusual patterns, such as unexpected file modifications or the execution of unknown processes.
* **Log Analysis:** Examining server and application logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, unauthorized file access, or error messages related to configuration loading.
* **Security Audits:** Regular security audits can identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that could enable this attack.
* **Code Reviews:**  Reviewing the codebase for potential vulnerabilities related to configuration file processing and insecure deserialization.

**4.1.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Secure File Permissions:** Implement strict file permissions to ensure that only authorized users and processes can access and modify configuration files. The principle of least privilege should be applied.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While primarily for user input, ensure that any configuration values read by the application are validated and sanitized to prevent code injection.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and processes.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests that might attempt to exploit vulnerabilities leading to file access.
* **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Koel and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Server Configuration:** Harden the server operating system and other services to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect access to the server and application.

#### 4.2. Change database credentials to gain access [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This sub-path is a specific method within the broader "Inject malicious code or scripts" attack vector. By modifying the database credentials stored in the configuration, an attacker can gain direct access to the application's database.

**4.2.1. Attack Flow:**

1. **Gain Unauthorized Access to Configuration Files:** This step is identical to the first step in the parent attack vector (4.1.1). The attacker needs access to the server's filesystem.

2. **Locate Database Credentials:** The attacker identifies the configuration file containing the database credentials. In Koel, this is highly likely to be the `.env` file.

3. **Modify Database Credentials:** The attacker changes the values for database host, username, password, and database name within the configuration file.

4. **Access the Database:** Using the modified credentials, the attacker can now directly connect to the Koel database using database management tools or scripts.

**4.2.2. Prerequisites:**

* **Unauthorized access to configuration files:**  As described in 4.1.2.
* **Database credentials stored in plaintext or easily reversible format:** If the credentials are encrypted or securely stored, this attack becomes significantly more difficult.
* **Database server accessible to the attacker:** The attacker needs network access to the database server.

**4.2.3. Potential Impact:**

* **Data Breach:** Direct access to the database allows the attacker to steal all sensitive data stored by Koel, including user credentials, music library information, and potentially other sensitive application data.
* **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption, loss of functionality, and potential legal repercussions.
* **Account Takeover:** With access to user credentials, the attacker can log in as legitimate users and perform actions on their behalf.
* **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker might be able to exploit database vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain further access to the server or other systems.
* **Planting Backdoors:** The attacker could create new administrative accounts within the database to maintain persistent access.

**4.2.4. Detection Methods:**

* **Configuration Change Monitoring:**  Detecting unauthorized modifications to the `.env` file or other configuration files containing database credentials.
* **Database Audit Logging:** Monitoring database access attempts, especially those using unusual credentials or originating from unexpected locations.
* **Failed Login Attempts:**  Monitoring for repeated failed login attempts to the database, which could indicate an attacker trying to brute-force credentials or using incorrect credentials after a configuration change.
* **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring network traffic for connections to the database server from unusual sources.

**4.2.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Secure File Permissions:**  As described in 4.1.5, restrict access to configuration files.
* **Secure Storage of Database Credentials:** Avoid storing database credentials in plaintext in configuration files. Consider using environment variables managed by the operating system or dedicated secrets management solutions.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access:** Grant only necessary database privileges to the Koel application. Avoid using a highly privileged database user for the application.
* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for database users.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the database server on a separate network segment with restricted access.
* **Regular Security Audits of Database Configuration:** Review database user permissions and access controls.
* **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** Implement DAM solutions to monitor and audit database activity in real-time.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path involving the modification of configuration files to inject malicious code, specifically by changing database credentials, represents a significant security risk for the Koel application. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences, including complete server compromise and data breaches.

By understanding the attacker's methodology, identifying prerequisites, and implementing robust detection and mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack.
