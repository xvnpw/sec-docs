**Upload Malicious Audio File (e.g., with embedded script, exploiting metadata parsing) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted audio file containing malicious code embedded within its metadata (like ID3 tags). When Koel processes this file, the malicious code is executed on the server.
        * **Upload Malicious Playlist File (e.g., with path traversal, leading to file access/overwrite) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** An attacker uploads a playlist file that contains manipulated file paths. These paths use "path traversal" techniques (like `../../`) to access or overwrite sensitive files outside of Koel's intended directories.
