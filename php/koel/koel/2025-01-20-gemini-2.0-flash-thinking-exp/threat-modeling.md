# Threat Model Analysis for koel/koel

## Threat: [Malicious Media File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_media_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially a user with upload privileges or someone exploiting an upload vulnerability *within Koel*, uploads a specially crafted audio file. This file exploits a vulnerability in *Koel's* media processing libraries (e.g., during tag parsing or codec handling). Upon *Koel* processing this file (e.g., during library scan or playback), the malicious code embedded within the file is executed on the server.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting Koel, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, install malware, or pivot to other systems on the network.

**Affected Component:** Media Processing Module (specifically libraries used for audio decoding and metadata parsing *within Koel*).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for uploaded files *within Koel*, including thorough checks on file headers and content.
* Utilize sandboxing or containerization for media processing tasks *initiated by Koel* to limit the impact of potential exploits.
* Regularly update *Koel's* dependencies, especially media processing libraries, to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during Library Scan](./threats/path_traversal_during_library_scan.md)

**Description:** An attacker, by manipulating configuration settings or exploiting a vulnerability in the library scanning functionality *within Koel*, can trick *Koel* into accessing files outside the intended music library directory. This could involve crafting specific paths or using symbolic links within the scanned directory.

**Impact:** Information disclosure by accessing sensitive files on the server, potential for arbitrary file read if the accessed files contain sensitive information, or in some cases, the ability to manipulate or delete files outside the intended scope.

**Affected Component:** Library Scanning Module (specifically the function responsible for traversing directories and accessing files *within Koel*).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict path sanitization and validation during library scanning *within Koel*, ensuring that *Koel* only accesses files within the configured music library directory.
* Avoid relying on user-provided paths directly; use canonicalization techniques *within Koel* to resolve symbolic links and ensure the final path is within the allowed boundaries.

## Threat: [Insecure API Endpoints leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/insecure_api_endpoints_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** *Koel* exposes an API for various functionalities. If certain API endpoints lack proper authentication or authorization checks *within Koel's implementation*, an attacker can directly access these endpoints without proper credentials. This could involve manipulating API requests to bypass security measures.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to music libraries, modification of user data, creation of new users, or potentially gaining administrative control over the Koel instance depending on the vulnerable endpoint.

**Affected Component:** API Endpoints and Authentication/Authorization Module *within Koel*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints *within Koel*. Ensure that every request is properly authenticated and authorized based on user roles and permissions.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing API endpoints *in Koel*, granting access only to the necessary data and functionalities.

## Threat: [Bypass of Koel's Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/bypass_of_koel's_authentication_mechanisms.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in *Koel's* specific authentication implementation (e.g., flaws in password hashing, session management, or login logic) could allow an attacker to bypass the login process without providing valid credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and their associated music libraries.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module *within Koel*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong and industry-standard authentication mechanisms *within Koel*.
* Use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
* Implement secure session management practices, including using secure and HttpOnly cookies.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Koel's User Roles](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_koel's_user_roles.md)

**Description:** If *Koel* has a role-based access control system, vulnerabilities could allow a user with limited privileges to gain access to functionalities intended for administrators or other higher-privileged users. This could be due to flaws in permission checks or insecure handling of user roles *within Koel's code*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of settings, access to other users' data, or even the ability to compromise the entire Koel instance.

**Affected Component:** Authorization and User Management Module *within Koel*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a robust and well-defined role-based access control system *within Koel*.
* Enforce strict permission checks before granting access to sensitive functionalities.
