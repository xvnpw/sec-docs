# Attack Surface Analysis for koel/koel

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows users to upload files without sufficient restrictions on file type, size, or content.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** Koel's core functionality involves uploading audio files to build a personal music library. This inherently requires a file upload mechanism.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an audio file. If the server is not configured correctly or Koel doesn't properly handle the file, this script could be executed, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the server, data breaches, malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict server-side file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not just the file extension. Enforce reasonable file size limits. Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions. Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Consider using a dedicated storage service.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about the source of the Koel application and ensure it's from a trusted source. Keep the application updated.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Audio Processing Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_audio_processing_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Koel relies on external libraries for processing and potentially transcoding audio files. These libraries might contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** Koel's functionality necessitates the use of audio processing libraries to handle various audio formats and potentially perform operations like transcoding.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a used audio decoding library could be triggered by a specially crafted audio file uploaded by a user. This could lead to a denial-of-service (crashes the Koel instance) or, in more severe cases, remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** High - Denial of service, potential remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update all third-party libraries and dependencies used by Koel, including audio processing libraries. Implement robust error handling and input validation when processing audio files. Consider using sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of vulnerabilities in these libraries.
        *   **Users:** Keep the Koel application updated to benefit from security patches for underlying libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** Koel likely exposes API endpoints for managing music libraries, playlists, and user settings. Weaknesses in authentication or authorization for these specific endpoints can be exploited.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** Koel's web interface and potentially other clients interact with a backend API. Flaws in securing these API endpoints directly expose Koel's data and functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a lack of proper authorization checks in an API endpoint to modify another user's playlists or delete their music library. Weak authentication could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** High - Data breaches, unauthorized modification of user data, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0). Enforce proper authorization checks on all API endpoints to ensure users can only access and modify resources they are permitted to. Avoid relying solely on client-side validation for security. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   **Users:** Use strong, unique passwords for their Koel accounts. Be cautious about granting access to third-party applications that interact with the Koel API.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Koel might ship with default configurations that are less secure, such as weak default passwords or overly permissive access controls.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** The initial setup and configuration of Koel are crucial. Insecure defaults can leave installations vulnerable from the start.
    *   **Example:** Koel might have a default administrative username and password that is publicly known. An attacker could use these credentials to gain full control over the Koel instance.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the Koel instance and potentially the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure Koel does not ship with any easily guessable default credentials. Force users to set strong, unique passwords during the initial setup. Implement secure default settings for access controls and other sensitive configurations. Provide clear documentation on security best practices for configuration.
        *   **Users:** Immediately change any default credentials upon installation. Review and harden the Koel configuration based on security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Handling](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_file_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  The application might not properly sanitize user-provided input when accessing files, allowing attackers to access files outside of the intended directories.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** Koel needs to access and serve audio files from the server's file system. If file paths are constructed using unsanitized user input (e.g., in API calls or when handling playlist data), this vulnerability can arise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious request containing ".." sequences in a file path parameter, potentially allowing them to access sensitive system files or other users' music files.
    *   **Impact:** High - Access to sensitive data, potential for remote code execution if executable files can be accessed and triggered.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths. Use secure file access methods and validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths. Implement proper access controls to restrict file access based on user permissions.
        *   **Users:**  Be aware of the risks of running Koel in environments where untrusted users have access to the server or can manipulate file paths.
