# Threat Model Analysis for koel/koel

## Threat: [Unauthorized Playlist Modification](./threats/unauthorized_playlist_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Playlist Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker with a valid, low-privileged Koel user account exploits vulnerabilities in the playlist management API to modify playlists they do not own.  The attacker could add, remove, or reorder songs, or even delete entire playlists belonging to other users. This is achieved by sending crafted API requests that bypass Koel's intended authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of user data (playlists), disruption of service for other users, potential reputational damage to the Koel instance owner.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend API (Laravel): `app/Http/Controllers/PlaylistController.php` (and related models/services like `app/Models/Playlist.php`, `app/Services/PlaylistService.php` - specific files may vary depending on Koel version).  Specifically, functions related to creating, updating, and deleting playlists and playlist songs (e.g., `store`, `update`, `destroy`, `addSongs`, `removeSongs`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict ownership checks within the `PlaylistController` methods.  Before any modification, verify that the authenticated user is the owner of the playlist or has explicit permission to modify it. Use Laravel's authorization features (Policies or Gates) to centralize access control logic.  Ensure that all playlist modification requests are validated against a schema to prevent unexpected data from being processed.
        *   **User/Admin:** Regularly review user permissions and ensure that only trusted users have elevated privileges.

## Threat: [Metadata Tampering](./threats/metadata_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Metadata Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker, potentially a registered user or even an unauthenticated user if API endpoints are not properly secured, sends malicious requests to Koel's API to modify song metadata (artist, album, title, etc.).  The attacker might try to inject malicious code (though this would be a general XSS vulnerability, the *entry point* is Koel's metadata update functionality), deface song information, or disrupt the organization of the music library.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption (incorrect metadata), potential for XSS if input validation is weak (though XSS is out of scope for this *Koel-specific* list, the impact is relevant), disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backend API (Laravel): `app/Http/Controllers/SongController.php` (and related models/services).  Specifically, functions related to updating song information (e.g., `update`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization *within the `SongController`'s `update` method (and any other relevant methods)*.  Validate data types, lengths, and allowed characters.  Use Laravel's validation rules and potentially custom validators.  Implement authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., administrators or users with specific roles) can modify metadata.
        *   **User/Admin:** Limit the number of users with administrative privileges.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Media File Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_media_file_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Media File Parsing Vulnerabilities

    * **Description:** An attacker uploads or places a specially crafted media file (e.g., MP3, FLAC) in the Koel music directory. This file contains malicious code or data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries Koel uses to parse media file metadata (e.g., ID3 tags). This could lead to code execution on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), complete server compromise, data breach.
    * **Affected Component:** Backend (Laravel): `app/Services/MediaInformationService.php` (or similar service responsible for extracting metadata), and any underlying libraries used for media file parsing (e.g., `getID3`, `FFmpeg` - if used for metadata extraction).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Keep all media parsing libraries (e.g., `getID3`) up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Use secure and well-vetted libraries.  Consider sandboxing or isolating the media parsing process to limit the impact of any potential vulnerabilities.  Implement input validation to check the validity of media files before parsing them.  If possible, disable or restrict the parsing of potentially dangerous metadata fields.
        * **User/Admin:** Regularly update Koel to ensure you have the latest versions of dependencies.  Be cautious about adding media files from untrusted sources.
