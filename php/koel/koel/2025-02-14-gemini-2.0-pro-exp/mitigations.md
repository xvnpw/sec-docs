## Mitigation Strategy: [Koel API Input Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/koel_api_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Comprehensive Input Validation and Sanitization for Koel's API

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All Endpoints:** Create a complete inventory of *all* Koel API endpoints (e.g., `/api/songs`, `/api/playlists`, `/api/user/login`, etc.).
2.  **Endpoint-Specific Validation:** For *each* endpoint, define precise validation rules using Laravel's validation system (or a suitable alternative). This includes:
    *   Data types (e.g., integer, string, array, boolean).
    *   String lengths (minimum and maximum).
    *   Allowed values (e.g., using `in:` rule for enums).
    *   Formats (e.g., email, URL, UUID).
    *   Required fields.
3.  **Whitelist Approach:** Prefer whitelisting allowed characters and patterns over blacklisting. For example, for song titles, explicitly define allowed characters (alphanumeric, spaces, certain punctuation) rather than trying to exclude all potentially harmful characters.
4.  **Sanitize User Input:** Before using user input in database queries, file operations, or HTML output, sanitize it to remove or encode potentially harmful characters. Use Laravel's built-in escaping functions or a dedicated sanitization library. Pay particular attention to:
    *   Song metadata (title, artist, album, lyrics).
    *   Playlist names and descriptions.
    *   User profile information.
    *   Search queries.
5.  **Parameterized Queries:** Ensure *all* database interactions use parameterized queries (via Eloquent or the query builder) to prevent SQL injection. *Never* directly concatenate user input into SQL strings.
6.  **Frontend Validation (Consistency):** While the backend validation is *critical*, maintain consistent validation rules in the Vue.js frontend for a better user experience and to reduce unnecessary server requests. Use a Vue.js validation library that mirrors the backend rules as closely as possible.
7. **Regular Expression Review:** Audit all regular expressions used for validation or data processing within Koel's codebase. Ensure they are correctly written and do not introduce ReDoS vulnerabilities. Test them with a variety of inputs, including edge cases.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Koel's API to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Injecting malicious JavaScript into Koel's web interface via API inputs (e.g., song metadata).
*   **Command Injection (High Severity):** If Koel interacts with the OS, injecting commands via API inputs.
*   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Manipulating file paths via API inputs to access unauthorized files (if Koel handles file uploads or storage).
*   **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) (Medium Severity):** Crafting input that causes a regular expression within Koel to take an extremely long time to execute.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Eliminates risk (100%) with consistent use of parameterized queries.
*   **XSS:** Significantly reduces risk (by 90-95%) with thorough input validation and sanitization specific to Koel's data.
*   **Command Injection/Path Traversal:** Significantly reduces risk (by 90-95%) if input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in file or OS operations.
*   **ReDoS:** Reduces risk (by 70-80%) with careful regex design and testing within Koel.

**Currently Implemented (Likely Partial):**
*   Koel, being a Laravel application, likely has *some* input validation in place using Laravel's validation features.
*   Eloquent ORM provides some inherent protection against SQL injection.

**Missing Implementation (Likely Areas):**
*   Incomplete or inconsistent validation across *all* Koel API endpoints.
*   Lack of a strict whitelist approach for all relevant fields.
*   Insufficient sanitization of user-provided data before it's used in various parts of the application.
*   Potential for ReDoS vulnerabilities if complex regular expressions are used without thorough testing *within Koel's context*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Koel Authentication and Authorization Logic](./mitigation_strategies/koel_authentication_and_authorization_logic.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Harden Koel's Authentication and Authorization Code

**Description:**
1.  **Review Authentication Flow:** Thoroughly review Koel's authentication code (likely involving JWT or sessions). Ensure it adheres to best practices:
    *   Secure generation and storage of secrets (e.g., JWT signing keys). Use environment variables, *not* hardcoded values.
    *   Proper token expiration and invalidation.
    *   Protection against replay attacks (if applicable).
2.  **Authorization Checks (Every Endpoint):** Implement authorization checks *within* each relevant Koel API endpoint. This is *crucial*. Don't rely solely on middleware; explicitly check user permissions *before* performing any action. For example:
    *   Before allowing a user to modify a playlist, verify that they own the playlist or have the necessary permissions.
    *   Before allowing a user to access a song, verify they have the right to stream it (e.g., based on subscription level, if applicable).
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a clear RBAC system within Koel. Define roles (e.g., "user," "admin," "moderator") and assign permissions to each role. Ensure users are assigned the appropriate roles.
4.  **Password Management:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies within Koel's user registration and password reset functionality.
    *   Use a secure password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Implement secure password reset mechanisms (e.g., using unique, expiring tokens).
5. **Session Management (if used):** If Koel uses sessions, ensure secure session handling:
   * Use secure, HTTP-only cookies.
    * Set appropriate session expiration times.
    * Implement proper session invalidation on logout.
    * Protect against session fixation and hijacking.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Users accessing Koel's features or data they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** A regular user gaining administrative privileges within Koel.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Against Koel's login functionality.
*   **Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity):** Using stolen credentials to access Koel accounts.
*   **Session Hijacking (High Severity):** Stealing a user's Koel session.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access/Privilege Escalation:** Significantly reduces risk (by 90-95%) with comprehensive authorization checks *within* Koel's code.
*   **Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:** Reduces risk (by 80-90%) with strong password policies and rate limiting (addressed separately).
*   **Session Hijacking:** Reduces risk (by 70-80%) with secure session management practices within Koel.

**Currently Implemented (Likely Partial):**
*   Koel likely has basic authentication and some level of authorization.

**Missing Implementation (Likely Areas):**
*   Incomplete or inconsistent authorization checks *within* all relevant API endpoints. This is a common area for vulnerabilities.
*   Lack of a well-defined RBAC system with granular permissions.
*   Potentially weak password policies or insecure password reset mechanisms.
*   Insecure session management practices (if sessions are used).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Koel's Media Handling (Path Traversal and Metadata)](./mitigation_strategies/koel's_media_handling__path_traversal_and_metadata_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Koel's Media File Handling and Metadata Processing

**Description:**
1.  **File Path Sanitization:** If Koel handles file paths (e.g., for storing or accessing media files), *strictly* sanitize all file paths received from user input or external sources. Use Laravel's built-in file handling functions and ensure they are used securely. *Never* construct file paths by directly concatenating user input.
2.  **Metadata Sanitization:** Koel likely processes metadata from media files (e.g., ID3 tags). Thoroughly sanitize *all* metadata fields before displaying them or using them in any way. This is crucial to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Use a dedicated library for parsing and sanitizing metadata, if available.
3.  **Access Control (Media Files):** Implement strict access control to media files. Ensure only authenticated and authorized users can access them. This might involve:
    *   Storing files outside the web root.
    *   Using a dedicated route/controller to serve media files, with authentication and authorization checks.
    *   Generating temporary, expiring URLs for media access.
4. **Review External Service Integrations:** If Koel integrates with external services (e.g., Last.fm, YouTube) for metadata or media, carefully review how data from these services is handled. Sanitize any data received from external sources before using it within Koel.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Koel's file handling to access files outside the intended media directory.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Via malicious metadata (e.g., in song titles, artist names) from media files or external services.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Media (Medium Severity):** Users accessing media files they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact:**
*   **Path Traversal:** Eliminates risk (100%) with rigorous file path sanitization and secure file handling practices *within* Koel*.
*   **XSS (via metadata):** Significantly reduces risk (by 90-95%) with thorough sanitization of all metadata.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces risk (by 80-90%) with proper access control mechanisms for media files.

**Currently Implemented (Likely Partial):**
*   Koel likely stores media files outside the web root.
*   Basic file permissions are probably set.

**Missing Implementation (Likely Areas):**
*   Insufficient sanitization of file paths and metadata.
*   Lack of robust access control mechanisms for media files, specifically within Koel's logic.
*   Potential vulnerabilities in how Koel handles data from external services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Koel-Specific Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/koel-specific_rate_limiting.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Koel-Specific Rate Limiting on Vulnerable Endpoints

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Vulnerable Endpoints:** Identify Koel API endpoints that are particularly susceptible to abuse:
    *   `/api/user/login`: Prevent brute-force login attempts.
    *   `/api/user/register`: Prevent automated account creation.
    *   `/api/search`: Prevent excessive search queries that could overload the server.
    *   `/api/playlists`: Limit the rate of playlist creation/modification to prevent spam or abuse.
    *   Any endpoints that involve external API calls (e.g., Last.fm, YouTube integration) to prevent exceeding API rate limits.
2.  **Implement Rate Limiting (Laravel):** Use Laravel's built-in rate limiting features (middleware) to apply rate limits to these specific endpoints. Configure appropriate limits based on expected usage patterns.
3.  **Custom Rate Limiting (if needed):** If Laravel's built-in rate limiter is insufficient, implement custom rate limiting logic within Koel's controllers or middleware.
4. **Informative Error Responses:** When a rate limit is exceeded, return a clear and informative error response (HTTP status code 429 Too Many Requests) with a `Retry-After` header indicating when the client can retry. This should be handled within Koel's API response logic.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Against Koel's login functionality.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Targeting specific Koel API endpoints.
*   **API Abuse (Low Severity):** Excessive use of Koel's API, potentially impacting performance or external service integrations.

**Impact:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk (by 90-95%) by limiting login attempts.
*   **DoS Attacks:** Reduces the impact of DoS attacks targeting specific Koel endpoints (by 50-70%).
*   **API Abuse:** Makes abuse more difficult and less effective (reduces risk by 60-80%).

**Currently Implemented (Likely Limited):**
*   Laravel provides built-in rate limiting, but it might not be comprehensively applied to all vulnerable Koel endpoints.

**Missing Implementation (Likely Areas):**
*   Lack of rate limiting on all identified vulnerable Koel API endpoints.
*   Insufficiently low rate limits for sensitive endpoints.
*   Missing or inconsistent error handling for rate limit exceeded scenarios within Koel.
