# Attack Surface Analysis for koel/koel

## Attack Surface: [Media File Processing](./attack_surfaces/media_file_processing.md)

**Description:** Koel processes uploaded audio files to extract metadata (artist, album, title, etc.) and potentially for transcoding. This relies on external libraries, but the *invocation and handling* of these libraries are within Koel's code.

**Koel's Contribution:** Koel's core functionality *requires* processing user-provided audio files. The logic for handling file uploads, calling external libraries, and processing the results is entirely within Koel's codebase.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted MP3 file containing a malformed ID3 tag designed to trigger a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `getID3` library (or a similar vulnerability in `taglib` or FFmpeg if used for transcoding). Koel's code calls the vulnerable library function without proper input sanitization.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. The attacker could gain full control of the Koel server and potentially the underlying host system.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developer:**
    *   *Update Dependencies Religiously:* Automate dependency updates and apply security patches for media processing libraries *immediately* upon release. This is handled *externally* to Koel, but Koel's code must be updated to use the patched versions.
    *   *Sandboxing:* Run media processing in an isolated environment (e.g., a separate Docker container with minimal privileges). This is a *deployment* concern, but Koel's code can be structured to facilitate this (e.g., by using a message queue to offload processing to a separate worker).
    *   *Input Validation:* Implement strict file type validation (checking the *actual* file content, not just the extension) *within Koel's code*. Limit file sizes to reasonable maximums. Consider using a whitelist of allowed metadata tags *before* passing data to external libraries.
    *   *Fuzzing:* Perform fuzz testing on the Koel code that handles media file processing and interacts with external libraries.
    *   *Code Review:* Thoroughly review the Koel code that handles media file processing, paying close attention to memory management and input validation.

## Attack Surface: [JWT Authentication](./attack_surfaces/jwt_authentication.md)

**Description:** Koel uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for API authentication. The security of the API hinges on Koel's *implementation* of JWT handling.

**Koel's Contribution:** Koel's API is a central component, and its chosen authentication mechanism (JWT), including token generation, validation, and handling of the secret key, is entirely within Koel's code.

**Example:**

*   *Algorithm Confusion:* Koel's code doesn't explicitly reject JWTs signed with the "none" algorithm. An attacker sends a request with such a token, and Koel accepts it, granting unauthorized access.
*   *Secret Key Leakage:* While the *storage* of the secret key might be an environment variable, Koel's code is responsible for *reading* and *using* that key. If the code incorrectly handles the key (e.g., logs it, exposes it through an API endpoint), it creates a vulnerability.
*    *Weak Secret:* Koel code does not enforce strong secret.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Koel API, allowing an attacker to perform any action as any user. Complete application compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developer:**
    *   *Strong Secret Key:* Koel's code should *validate* that the configured secret key meets minimum length and complexity requirements (even if the key itself is set externally).
    *   *Secure Key Handling:* Koel's code must *never* log the secret key, expose it through an API endpoint, or otherwise make it accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   *Strict JWT Validation:* Implement rigorous JWT validation *within Koel's code*, including:
        *   *Signature Verification:* Always verify the JWT signature.
        *   *Expiration Check:* Reject expired tokens.
        *   *Audience and Issuer Validation:* Ensure the `aud` and `iss` claims match expected values.
        *   *Algorithm Enforcement:* Explicitly allow only strong signing algorithms (e.g., `HS256`, `HS512`) and reject tokens signed with weak or "none" algorithms. This *must* be enforced in Koel's code.
    *   *Regular Key Rotation:* While the *mechanism* for key rotation might be external, Koel's code needs to be able to *handle* key changes gracefully (e.g., by supporting multiple valid keys during a transition period).

## Attack Surface: [Directory Traversal](./attack_surfaces/directory_traversal.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to access files outside the intended media directory by manipulating file paths passed to Koel's API.

**Koel's Contribution:** Koel's code is responsible for handling requests to serve media files and *must* sanitize and validate file paths to prevent directory traversal.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `/api/download?path=../../../../etc/passwd` in an attempt to download the system's password file. Koel's code, without proper sanitization, uses this path directly to access the file.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive system files.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developer:**
    *   *Path Sanitization:* Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided file paths *within Koel's code* before using them. Remove any occurrences of `../` or similar sequences.
    *   *Whitelist Approach:* Instead of blacklisting, use a whitelist. Define a strict set of allowed characters and paths *within Koel's code*, and reject anything that doesn't match.
    *   *Avoid User Input in Paths:* If possible, avoid using user-supplied input directly in file paths *within Koel's code*. Use a database lookup or a predefined mapping.
