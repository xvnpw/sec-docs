*   **Threat:** Malicious Audio File Upload
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted audio file. This file could exploit vulnerabilities in Koel's audio processing libraries or contain embedded code that gets executed when the file is processed or played. The attacker might use this to gain unauthorized access to the server or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or consuming excessive resources.
        *   Information Disclosure by exploiting vulnerabilities to read sensitive files.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Upload Handler` module (responsible for receiving and storing uploaded files).
        *   `Audio Processing Library` (the specific library Koel uses for handling audio formats, e.g., for metadata extraction or transcoding).
        *   `Streaming Service` (if the malicious file causes issues during playback).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for uploaded files, including file type and size checks.
            *   Use well-maintained and regularly updated audio processing libraries with known security records.
            *   Consider sandboxing or containerizing the audio processing tasks to limit the impact of potential exploits.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential client-side attacks if malicious content is served.
        *   **User:**
            *   Only upload audio files from trusted sources.
            *   Keep the Koel application updated to benefit from security patches.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Filenames
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads an audio file with a maliciously crafted filename containing path traversal characters (e.g., `../../`). If Koel doesn't properly sanitize filenames, this could allow the attacker to write the uploaded file to arbitrary locations on the server's file system, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing executable code in accessible directories.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overwriting system files or placing malicious scripts.
        *   Data corruption or loss by overwriting important data.
        *   Privilege escalation if executable files are placed in privileged directories.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Upload Handler` module (specifically the part responsible for saving the uploaded file).
        *   `File System Interaction` functions (used for writing files to disk).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Implement strict filename sanitization to remove or replace path traversal characters before saving files.
            *   Store uploaded files in a dedicated directory with restricted permissions.
            *   Avoid directly using user-provided filenames for file system operations. Generate unique, safe filenames server-side.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be cautious about the filenames of the audio files you upload.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Audio Streaming Access
    *   **Description:** Koel might not enforce proper authorization checks when serving audio files for streaming. An attacker could potentially bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to directly access and download audio files they shouldn't have access to, even without logging in or with limited privileges.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to and download of user's music library.
        *   Potential copyright infringement if the attacker redistributes the accessed content.
        *   Privacy violation for users who expect their music library to be private.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Streaming Service` module (responsible for serving audio content).
        *   `Authentication Module` (if bypassed).
        *   `Authorization Module` (if not properly implemented or enforced).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Ensure that every request to stream an audio file is properly authenticated and authorized.
            *   Implement access controls based on user roles and permissions.
            *   Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for authorization.
        *   **User:**
            *   Ensure your Koel instance is properly configured with strong authentication.
            *   Be aware of who has access to your Koel instance.

*   **Threat:** Weak Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** If Koel ships with default administrative credentials that are not changed during installation or initial setup, an attacker could easily gain full administrative access to the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the Koel instance.
        *   Access to all user data and audio files.
        *   Ability to modify application settings and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Authentication Module` (specifically the default user creation or login process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Avoid shipping with default credentials.
            *   Force users to set strong, unique credentials during the initial setup process.
            *   Provide clear instructions on how to change default credentials.
        *   **User:**
            *   Immediately change any default credentials upon installation.
            *   Use strong, unique passwords for all user accounts.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Password Reset Mechanism
    *   **Description:** A flawed password reset process could allow an attacker to reset the password of any user account, including administrative accounts, without proper authorization. This could involve vulnerabilities like predictable reset tokens, lack of email verification, or insecure handling of reset links.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Account takeover, allowing the attacker to access and control user accounts.
        *   Potential for data breaches and unauthorized actions performed under the compromised account.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Password Reset Module` (responsible for handling password reset requests).
        *   `Email Service Integration` (if email verification is involved).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Use strong, unpredictable, and time-limited reset tokens.
            *   Implement email verification to ensure the password reset request originates from the legitimate account owner.
            *   Use secure communication channels (HTTPS) for password reset links.
            *   Consider implementing account lockout after multiple failed reset attempts.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be cautious about password reset emails and ensure they come from a legitimate source.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Update Channel
    *   **Description:** If Koel's update mechanism doesn't use secure channels (e.g., HTTPS with proper certificate validation) or doesn't verify the integrity of updates, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to deliver a malicious update containing malware or backdoors.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Installation of malicious software on the server.
        *   Complete compromise of the Koel instance and potentially the underlying server.
        *   Data breaches and unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Update Checker` module (responsible for checking for new updates).
        *   `Update Download Handler` (responsible for downloading update files).
        *   `Update Installation Script` (responsible for applying the update).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   Use HTTPS for all update communication and enforce proper certificate validation.
            *   Digitally sign update packages to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
            *   Implement a mechanism to verify the signature before applying the update.
        *   **User:**
            *   Ensure your server environment has a secure network connection.
            *   Be cautious about manually installing updates from untrusted sources.
