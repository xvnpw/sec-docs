Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Koel, with high and critical severity:

*   **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:**  The application allows users to upload files, which can be exploited by uploading malicious files.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:** Koel's core functionality revolves around managing and playing audio files, necessitating a file upload feature. This feature, if not properly secured, becomes a direct entry point for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP file disguised as an MP3. If the server doesn't prevent execution of uploaded files, this could lead to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not just the extension.
            *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot to prevent direct execution.
            *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement file size limits.
            *   Consider using a dedicated storage service with security features.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Ensure the web server is configured to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` for Apache or appropriate configurations for other servers).

*   **Metadata Processing Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Koel extracts and processes metadata from uploaded audio files. This process can be vulnerable to attacks if malicious metadata is crafted.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:**  Koel's functionality requires reading metadata (like artist, title, album) to organize and display music. This necessitates parsing potentially untrusted data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts an MP3 file with excessively long metadata fields, leading to a buffer overflow in the metadata parsing library used by Koel, potentially causing a denial of service or even code execution.
    *   **Impact:** High - Denial of service, potential remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use well-vetted and regularly updated libraries for metadata extraction.
            *   Implement input validation and sanitization on extracted metadata before storing or displaying it.
            *   Set limits on the size and length of metadata fields.
            *   Implement error handling to gracefully manage malformed metadata.

*   **Insecure API Endpoints (if exposed)**
    *   **Description:** If Koel exposes an API for managing music or other functionalities, vulnerabilities in these endpoints can be exploited.
    *   **How Koel Contributes:**  Depending on the features, Koel might offer an API for mobile apps or other integrations. Poorly secured API endpoints can expose sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint for deleting songs lacks proper authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user to delete any song.
    *   **Impact:** High - Data manipulation, unauthorized access, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints.
            *   Validate and sanitize all input received by API endpoints.
            *   Follow secure API design principles (e.g., least privilege).
            *   Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
            *   Use HTTPS for all API communication.
