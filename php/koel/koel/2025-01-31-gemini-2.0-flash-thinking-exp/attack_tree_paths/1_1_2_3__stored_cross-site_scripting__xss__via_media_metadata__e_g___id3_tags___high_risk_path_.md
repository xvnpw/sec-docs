### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Media Metadata

#### 4.1. Attack Path Description

**Attack Path Name:** 1.1.2.3. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Media Metadata (e.g., ID3 tags) [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into media file metadata (like ID3 tags) which is then displayed by Koel, leading to XSS.

**Key Risks:** Medium - Account compromise, data theft, defacement.

**Focus Areas for Mitigation:** Sanitize all media metadata before displaying it in the frontend, use appropriate encoding functions.

#### 4.2. Detailed Analysis

##### 4.2.1. Threat Actor

The threat actor in this scenario could be:

* **Malicious User:** A user with malicious intent who uploads media files specifically crafted to contain XSS payloads in their metadata. This could be any user who has the ability to upload or add media to the Koel library, depending on Koel's user roles and permissions.
* **Compromised User Account:** An attacker who has gained unauthorized access to a legitimate user account could upload malicious media files.
* **External Attacker (Less Likely, but Possible):** In scenarios where Koel might have vulnerabilities in its file upload or processing mechanisms, an external attacker could potentially inject malicious media files without direct user account access.

##### 4.2.2. Vulnerability

The core vulnerability lies in **insufficient sanitization and output encoding of media metadata** within the Koel application. Specifically:

* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Koel might not properly sanitize media metadata (e.g., ID3 tags) when it is extracted from uploaded media files and stored in the database. This means malicious JavaScript code injected into metadata fields can be stored persistently.
* **Lack of Output Encoding:** When Koel retrieves and displays this metadata in the frontend (e.g., in playlists, album views, search results), it might not properly encode the metadata before rendering it in HTML. This allows the browser to interpret the stored malicious JavaScript code as executable code, leading to XSS.

##### 4.2.3. Attack Scenario

1. **Malicious Media File Creation:** The attacker crafts a media file (e.g., MP3, MP4, etc.) and uses a metadata editor tool to inject malicious JavaScript code into one or more metadata fields. Common ID3 tag fields that could be targeted include:
    * `TIT2` (Title)
    * `TPE1` (Artist)
    * `TALB` (Album)
    * `COMM` (Comments)
    * `USLT` (Unsynchronized lyric/text transcription)
    * Other text-based metadata fields.

    **Example Payload in "Title" tag:** `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability in Koel!')</script>`

2. **Media File Upload/Ingestion:** The attacker uploads this malicious media file to Koel. This could happen through:
    * Koel's web interface (if it provides upload functionality).
    * Placing the file in a directory that Koel scans for new media.
    * Using Koel's API (if available and accessible).

3. **Metadata Extraction and Storage:** Koel processes the uploaded media file. It extracts the metadata, including the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the ID3 tags, and stores this metadata in its database (or file system, depending on Koel's architecture).

4. **Metadata Retrieval and Display:** When a user (victim) interacts with Koel and views the media file (e.g., browsing their library, playing a song, viewing an album), Koel retrieves the stored metadata from the database.

5. **XSS Execution:** Koel's frontend application renders the page, displaying the retrieved metadata. If Koel does not properly encode this metadata before inserting it into the HTML document, the browser will interpret the injected `<script>` tag and execute the malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser session, in the context of the Koel web application.

##### 4.2.4. Potential Impact

A successful Stored XSS attack via media metadata in Koel can have significant consequences:

* **Account Compromise:** The attacker's JavaScript code can steal the victim's session cookies or local storage tokens. This allows the attacker to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their Koel account, potentially leading to further malicious actions like data theft, modification, or deletion.
* **Data Theft:** The attacker's script can access and exfiltrate sensitive data accessible within the Koel application. This could include:
    * User data (usernames, email addresses, potentially more depending on Koel's data model).
    * Playlists and music library information.
    * Potentially server-side data if the XSS can be leveraged for further attacks (though less likely in a typical XSS scenario).
* **Defacement:** The attacker can manipulate the content displayed on the Koel page viewed by the victim. This could involve displaying misleading messages, malicious advertisements, or redirecting the user to attacker-controlled websites.
* **Malware Distribution:** In more advanced scenarios, the attacker could use XSS to redirect the victim to a website hosting malware or trick them into downloading malicious files, potentially compromising the victim's device.

##### 4.2.5. Likelihood

The likelihood of this attack path being exploited depends on several factors:

* **Koel's Current Security Posture:** If Koel currently lacks proper sanitization and output encoding for media metadata, the likelihood is **high**.
* **User Interaction with Media:** The more users interact with and browse media files in Koel, the higher the chance of triggering the XSS vulnerability.
* **Ease of Media Upload/Ingestion:** If any user can easily upload media files to Koel, the attack surface is larger, increasing the likelihood. If media uploads are restricted to administrators or specific roles, the likelihood is reduced but still present if those accounts are compromised.

Given the potential impact and the common nature of XSS vulnerabilities, this attack path should be considered a **high priority** for mitigation.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the Stored XSS via Media Metadata vulnerability, the following strategies should be implemented:

1. **Input Sanitization (Server-Side):**
    * **Sanitize Metadata Upon Extraction:** When Koel extracts metadata from uploaded media files, it must sanitize all text-based metadata fields *before* storing them in the database.
    * **HTML Encoding:** The primary sanitization method should be **HTML encoding**. This involves converting HTML-sensitive characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) into their corresponding HTML entities (e.g., `<` becomes `&lt;`). This prevents the browser from interpreting these characters as HTML tags and executing injected scripts.
    * **Apply to All Relevant Metadata Fields:** Ensure sanitization is applied to all metadata fields that are displayed in the frontend, including but not limited to Title, Artist, Album, Comments, Genre, etc.

2. **Output Encoding (Frontend):**
    * **Consistent Output Encoding:** Even with input sanitization, it is crucial to **always encode metadata when displaying it in the frontend**. This acts as a second layer of defense.
    * **Context-Aware Encoding:** Use appropriate encoding functions based on the context where the metadata is being displayed (e.g., HTML encoding for display in HTML content, JavaScript encoding if metadata is used within JavaScript code).
    * **Templating Engines:** Utilize templating engines or frontend frameworks (like React, Vue, Angular) that provide automatic output encoding features. Ensure these features are correctly configured and used for rendering metadata.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Implement a Strict CSP:** Deploy a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the capabilities of the browser when loading and executing resources.
    * **`default-src 'self'`:** A good starting point is to set `default-src 'self'`. This restricts the browser to only load resources from the application's own origin by default, significantly reducing the impact of XSS attacks by limiting the attacker's ability to load external malicious scripts.
    * **Refine CSP as Needed:**  Adjust the CSP directives based on Koel's specific requirements, but maintain a restrictive policy to minimize XSS risks.

4. **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**
    * **Periodic Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS flaws.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities, to validate the effectiveness of implemented mitigation measures.

5. **User Education (Less Direct Mitigation, but Good Practice):**
    * **Inform Users about Risks:** Educate users about the potential risks of uploading media files from untrusted sources, as these files could contain malicious metadata.
    * **Caution Users about Metadata Display:** If possible, consider displaying a warning to users when displaying metadata from uploaded files, especially if the source of the file is unknown or untrusted.

#### 4.4. Testing and Verification Recommendations

To verify the vulnerability and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, the following testing steps are recommended:

1. **Manual XSS Testing:**
    * **Create Malicious Media Files:** Use an ID3 tag editor (or similar tool for other metadata formats) to create media files (e.g., MP3, MP4) with XSS payloads injected into various metadata fields (Title, Artist, Album, Comments, etc.).
        * **Simple Payload:** `<script>alert('XSS Test')</script>`
        * **More Complex Payloads:**  Try payloads that attempt to steal cookies, redirect to external sites, or modify the page content.
    * **Upload to Koel:** Upload these malicious media files to Koel through the application's upload interface or by placing them in a scanned directory.
    * **Browse and Verify:** Navigate through Koel's frontend and view the media files where you injected the XSS payloads. Check if the JavaScript code executes (e.g., an alert box appears, or other malicious actions are observed).
    * **Test Different Metadata Fields:** Repeat the testing process with different ID3 tag fields and metadata formats to ensure comprehensive coverage.
    * **Test After Mitigation:** After implementing mitigation strategies (sanitization, encoding), repeat the manual testing to verify that the XSS vulnerability is no longer exploitable.

2. **Automated XSS Scanning:**
    * **Utilize Web Vulnerability Scanners:** Employ automated web vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Scanner, Acunetix) to scan the Koel application for XSS vulnerabilities. Configure the scanner to specifically test for Stored XSS in media metadata if possible.
    * **Integrate into CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate automated XSS scanning into the development pipeline (CI/CD) to perform regular security checks and detect potential XSS vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

3. **Code Review:**
    * **Review Metadata Handling Code:** Conduct a code review of the Koel codebase, specifically focusing on the modules responsible for:
        * Media file upload and processing.
        * Metadata extraction and storage.
        * Metadata retrieval and display in the frontend.
    * **Verify Sanitization and Encoding Implementation:** Ensure that proper sanitization and output encoding are implemented correctly in the relevant code sections.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and conducting thorough testing, the Koel development team can significantly reduce the risk of Stored XSS attacks via media metadata and enhance the overall security of the application.
