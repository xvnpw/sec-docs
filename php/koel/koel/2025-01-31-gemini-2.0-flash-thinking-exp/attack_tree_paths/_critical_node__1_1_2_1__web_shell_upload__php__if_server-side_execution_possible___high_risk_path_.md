### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2.1. Web Shell Upload (PHP, if server-side execution possible)

**Attack Path Description:**

This attack path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in Koel's file upload functionality to upload a malicious PHP script (a web shell) disguised as a legitimate media file (e.g., MP3, JPG, PNG). If successful, this allows the attacker to gain remote command execution on the server hosting Koel, leading to a full server compromise.

**4.1. Preconditions & Assumptions:**

* **File Upload Functionality Exists:** Koel, as a music streaming application, likely has file upload functionality for adding music files, album art, and potentially user profile pictures.
* **Web Server with PHP Execution:** Koel is built with PHP and requires a web server (like Apache or Nginx) configured to execute PHP scripts. This is a fundamental requirement for this attack path to be viable.
* **Vulnerability in File Upload Handling:**  The core assumption is that Koel (or its underlying framework/libraries) has vulnerabilities in how it handles file uploads, specifically:
    * **Insufficient File Type Validation:**  Koel might rely solely on client-side validation or easily bypassed server-side validation (e.g., checking only the file extension).
    * **Lack of Content-Type Verification:**  Koel might not properly verify the actual content type of the uploaded file, allowing an attacker to upload a PHP file with a misleading extension (e.g., `.mp3.php`, `.jpg.php`).
    * **Insecure File Storage Location:** Uploaded files might be stored in a publicly accessible directory within the web server's document root, and the web server might be configured to execute PHP files in that directory.
    * **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  While less directly related to web shell upload, lack of input sanitization elsewhere in the application could be leveraged post-compromise.

**4.2. Attack Steps:**

1. **Identify Upload Points:** The attacker first needs to identify potential file upload points within the Koel application. This could include:
    * **Music Upload Functionality:**  The primary function of Koel is music management, so music upload is the most likely target.
    * **Album Art Upload:**  Functionality to upload or change album artwork.
    * **User Profile Picture Upload:**  If Koel allows user profiles, there might be an option to upload profile pictures.
    * **Potentially other administrative upload features.**

2. **Craft Malicious PHP Web Shell:** The attacker creates a PHP web shell script. This script is designed to accept commands from the attacker (usually via HTTP requests) and execute them on the server. A simple web shell might look like this:

   ```php
   <?php
   if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
       system($_REQUEST['cmd']);
       echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_REQUEST['cmd']) . "</pre>";
   }
   ?>
   ```
   More sophisticated web shells can include features like file browsing, database management, and reverse shell capabilities.

3. **Disguise Web Shell as Media File:** The attacker renames the web shell file (e.g., `webshell.php`) to appear as a media file. Common techniques include:
    * **Double Extensions:**  `malicious.jpg.php` - hoping the server only checks the last extension.
    * **MIME Type Manipulation (less effective if server-side validation is robust):** Attempting to manipulate the MIME type in the HTTP request header.
    * **Embedding PHP code within a valid media file (steganography-like, less common for web shells but possible):**  Less likely to be effective for direct execution but could be a more advanced technique.

4. **Upload the Disguised Web Shell:** The attacker uses the identified upload point in the Koel application to upload the disguised web shell file.

5. **Access the Web Shell Directly:**  After successful upload, the attacker needs to determine the URL where the uploaded file is stored. This might involve:
    * **Predictable File Paths:**  If Koel uses predictable file naming conventions or storage locations (e.g., `/uploads/music/user123/malicious.jpg.php`).
    * **Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting other vulnerabilities in Koel to reveal file paths.
    * **Brute-forcing or Guessing:**  Trying common upload directory paths.

6. **Execute Commands via Web Shell:** Once the attacker accesses the web shell URL (e.g., `https://koel.example.com/uploads/music/user123/malicious.jpg.php`), they can send commands to the server through HTTP requests (e.g., using the `cmd` parameter in the example web shell above: `https://koel.example.com/uploads/music/user123/malicious.jpg.php?cmd=whoami`). The web shell executes these commands with the privileges of the web server process.

**4.3. Impact of Successful Web Shell Upload:**

A successful web shell upload results in **Critical** impact, primarily due to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. The consequences are severe and can include:

* **Full Server Compromise:** The attacker gains complete control over the web server.
* **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored on the server, including user data, application configuration, and potentially database credentials.
* **Application Defacement:**  Ability to modify the Koel application's website and content.
* **Malware Distribution:**  Using the compromised server to host and distribute malware.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Disrupting the availability of the Koel application and potentially other services on the server.
* **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Significant damage to the reputation of the organization hosting Koel.

**4.4. Focus Areas for Mitigation & Recommended Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of web shell upload attacks, the following focus areas and mitigation strategies are crucial for the Koel development team:

**4.4.1. Prevent Server-Side Execution of Uploaded Files (Primary Prevention):**

* **Separate Upload Directory & Execution Context:**
    * **Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root:**  Ideally, store uploaded files in a directory that is *not* served by the web server directly.
    * **Configure web server to *not* execute scripts in the upload directory:**  Use web server configurations (e.g., `.htaccess` for Apache, location blocks for Nginx) to disable script execution (PHP, CGI, etc.) in the directory where uploaded files are stored.
    * **Serve files through a dedicated script:**  Instead of directly serving files from the upload directory, use a script (e.g., in PHP) to retrieve and serve files. This script can enforce access control and prevent direct execution of uploaded files.

* **Robust File Validation (Server-Side is Mandatory):**
    * **MIME Type Validation:**  Verify the MIME type of the uploaded file based on its *content* (magic numbers/file signature), not just the file extension. Use functions like `mime_content_type()` in PHP or similar libraries.
    * **File Extension Whitelisting:**  Only allow uploads of explicitly permitted file extensions (e.g., `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.jpg`, `.png`).  **Blacklisting is insufficient and easily bypassed.**
    * **File Content Scanning (Optional but Highly Recommended):** Integrate with antivirus or malware scanning tools to scan uploaded files for malicious content before storage.

**4.4.2. Robust File Validation (Client-Side - for User Experience, not Security):**

* **Client-Side Validation (JavaScript):** Implement client-side validation (e.g., using JavaScript) to provide immediate feedback to the user and prevent unnecessary server requests for invalid file types. **However, client-side validation is easily bypassed and should *never* be relied upon for security.**

**4.4.3. Principle of Least Privilege for Web Server Processes:**

* **Run Web Server with Minimal Privileges:** Configure the web server process to run with the lowest possible privileges necessary to perform its functions. This limits the impact of a successful web shell execution.
* **Chroot Environment (Advanced):** Consider using a chroot environment to further isolate the web server process and limit its access to the file system.

**4.4.4. Security Audits and Code Reviews:**

* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on file upload functionalities.
* **Code Reviews:** Implement code reviews for all changes related to file upload handling to identify and address potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

**4.4.5. Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Detective/Preventative):**

* **Deploy a WAF:** A Web Application Firewall can help detect and block malicious requests, including attempts to upload web shells. Configure the WAF with rules to identify and block suspicious file uploads and common web shell patterns.

**4.4.6. Monitoring and Logging (Detective):**

* **Log File Upload Activity:**  Log all file upload attempts, including the filename, user, timestamp, and result (success/failure).
* **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**  Monitor web server logs for unusual activity, such as access to files in upload directories with script extensions, or unusual HTTP requests that might indicate web shell usage.

**4.4.7. Incident Response Plan (Corrective):**

* **Develop an Incident Response Plan:**  Have a clear incident response plan in place to handle security incidents, including web shell compromises. This plan should include steps for detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

**5. Conclusion and Recommendations:**

The "Web Shell Upload" attack path represents a **critical security risk** for the Koel application. Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise and severe consequences.

**It is highly recommended that the Koel development team prioritize implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, focusing primarily on preventing server-side execution of uploaded files and implementing robust server-side file validation.**

Specifically, the following actions are recommended in order of priority:

1. **Implement Server-Side Execution Prevention:**  Separate upload directory and execution context, configure web server to prevent script execution in upload directories.
2. **Implement Robust Server-Side File Validation:**  MIME type validation based on file content, file extension whitelisting.
3. **Review and Harden File Upload Code:** Conduct a thorough code review of all file upload related code to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Implement Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the web server process runs with minimal privileges.
5. **Consider Implementing a WAF and File Content Scanning.**
6. **Establish Monitoring and Logging for File Uploads.**
7. **Develop and Test an Incident Response Plan.**

By addressing these recommendations, the Koel development team can significantly reduce the risk of web shell upload attacks and enhance the overall security posture of the application.
