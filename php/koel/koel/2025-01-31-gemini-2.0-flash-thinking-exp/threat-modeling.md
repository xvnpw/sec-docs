# Threat Model Analysis for koel/koel

## Threat: [Malicious Media File Upload/Scanning](./threats/malicious_media_file_uploadscanning.md)

* **Description:** An attacker uploads a crafted media file to Koel. Koel's media processing (metadata extraction, transcoding) then processes this file, triggering a vulnerability in underlying libraries. This can lead to remote code execution on the server or denial of service.
* **Impact:**
    * Remote Code Execution on the Koel server.
    * Denial of Service, making Koel unavailable.
    * Potential Information Disclosure from server files.
* **Affected Koel Component:**
    * Media Processing Modules (metadata extraction, transcoding libraries).
    * File Upload/Library Scanning functionality.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use hardened and updated media processing libraries.
    * Implement strict input validation on uploaded files.
    * Sandbox media processing tasks.
    * Integrate file scanning for uploaded media.
    * Regularly audit Koel's media handling code.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Library Management Features](./threats/sql_injection_via_library_management_features.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits Koel's library management features (e.g., renaming, metadata editing via web interface) by injecting malicious SQL code. Koel's database queries, if not properly secured, execute this code, allowing database manipulation.
* **Impact:**
    * Data Breach: Access to Koel's database, exposing user and library data.
    * Data Tampering: Modification or deletion of music library data.
    * Potential server compromise via database access.
* **Affected Koel Component:**
    * Database interaction modules for library management.
    * Input handling for library management features in the web interface.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.
    * Sanitize user input for library management features.
    * Apply principle of least privilege to Koel's database user.
    * Regularly audit Koel's database interaction code.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** Koel relies on third-party libraries. Using outdated or vulnerable versions exposes Koel to known vulnerabilities in these dependencies. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise Koel and the server.
* **Impact:**
    * Remote Code Execution via vulnerable dependencies.
    * Information Disclosure due to dependency vulnerabilities.
    * Denial of Service exploiting dependency flaws.
    * Full compromise of the Koel application and potentially the server.
* **Affected Koel Component:**
    * Koel's dependency management (Composer, etc.).
    * All modules relying on vulnerable libraries.
* **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the dependency vulnerability).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use a dependency manager (like Composer).
    * Regularly update all dependencies to secure versions.
    * Employ dependency security scanning tools.
    * Monitor security advisories for Koel's dependencies.
