# Attack Surface Analysis for koel/koel

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Generated Metadata in Koel](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-generated_metadata_in_koel.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript injection through user-provided music metadata displayed by Koel. Koel's handling of song titles, artist names, or album names, if not properly sanitized, can lead to XSS.
*   **Koel Contribution:** Koel's feature of allowing users to manage and display music metadata directly introduces this attack surface if input sanitization is insufficient.
*   **Example:** Injecting `<script>...</script>` into a song title. When Koel displays this title, the script executes in other users' browsers.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of Koel interface, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement robust server-side and client-side input sanitization and output encoding specifically for all music metadata fields displayed by Koel. Utilize secure templating engines with automatic escaping. Regularly audit and update sanitization logic within Koel's codebase.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass in Koel's Backend](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_koel's_backend.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing Koel's API security to gain unauthorized access to functionalities or data. Weaknesses in Koel's authentication or authorization logic for its API endpoints can be exploited.
*   **Koel Contribution:** Koel's API design and implementation directly determine the strength of its authentication and authorization mechanisms. Flaws in these areas are Koel-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in Koel's API endpoint to access another user's music library or administrative settings without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data, privilege escalation within Koel, data manipulation, potential account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strong and secure authentication for Koel's API (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0). Enforce strict authorization checks at every API endpoint, ensuring Koel's backend verifies user permissions before granting access. Regularly audit and penetration test Koel's API authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Media Processing in Koel](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_media_processing_in_koel.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious commands into system commands executed by Koel during media processing. If Koel uses system commands for tasks like transcoding or metadata extraction and incorporates unsanitized input from media files, command injection is possible.
*   **Koel Contribution:** Koel's reliance on external tools or system commands for media handling creates this attack surface if input from media files (filenames, metadata) is not securely handled before being passed to these commands.
*   **Example:** Uploading a media file with a maliciously crafted filename that, when processed by Koel, leads to execution of arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the server hosting Koel, full server compromise, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Minimize or eliminate the use of system commands in Koel's media processing. If system commands are unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all input from media files before incorporating it into commands. Use secure libraries or functions for command execution that prevent injection. Consider sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of command injection vulnerabilities within the Koel deployment environment.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload and Handling in Koel (Cover Art, Music Files)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_and_handling_in_koel__cover_art__music_files_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Koel's file upload features to upload malicious files leading to server compromise. Improper validation of uploaded files in Koel, especially for cover art or music files (if allowed), can be exploited.
*   **Koel Contribution:** Koel's file upload functionalities for cover art and potentially music files directly introduce this attack surface if file validation and handling are not implemented securely within Koel.
*   **Example:** Uploading a malicious PHP script disguised as a cover art image. If Koel stores this file in a publicly accessible location and it can be executed by the web server, it leads to server compromise.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the server, full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strict file type validation in Koel based on file content (magic numbers) and not just file extensions. Sanitize filenames uploaded through Koel to prevent path traversal or other injection attacks. Store uploaded files outside of the web server's document root in Koel's backend. Implement robust access controls for uploaded files within Koel. Consider integrating antivirus scanning into Koel's file upload process.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations in Koel (Default Admin Credentials)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations_in_koel__default_admin_credentials_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting default, easily guessable administrative credentials in Koel. If Koel ships with default usernames and passwords that are not changed during installation, it becomes a critical vulnerability.
*   **Koel Contribution:** Koel's initial setup and default configuration directly determine if default credentials are present. This is a vulnerability inherent to Koel's distribution if not addressed.
*   **Example:** Using default credentials like "admin/password" to access Koel's administrative panel and gain full control.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, complete control over Koel instance and potentially the underlying server, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Eliminate default administrative credentials in Koel. Force users to set strong, unique passwords during the initial Koel installation or setup process. Provide clear and prominent instructions within Koel's documentation on the importance of changing default credentials immediately.
