# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for koel/koel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Media Files](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_media_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **File Type Validation:** On the server-side, check the MIME type of uploaded files using libraries that reliably detect MIME types based on file content, not just the extension. Compare against an allowlist of supported audio formats (e.g., `audio/mpeg`, `audio/ogg`, `audio/flac`).
    2.  **File Extension Validation:** Verify that the file extension matches the detected MIME type and is also on the allowlist (e.g., `.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.flac`).
    3.  **Filename Sanitization:**  Use a function to sanitize filenames. Replace or remove special characters, spaces, and characters that could be used for directory traversal (e.g., `../`, `./`, `\`, `/`, `:`, `;`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`). Consider limiting filename length.
    4.  **File Size Limits:** Configure the web server and application to enforce limits on the maximum size of uploaded files. This prevents resource exhaustion and potential denial-of-service attacks.
    5.  **Integrity Checks (Basic):**  Calculate a hash (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) of the uploaded file and store it. This can be used for basic integrity checks later.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload (High Severity):** Prevents users from uploading executable files or files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in media processing libraries within Koel.
    *   **Directory Traversal (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating filenames to access or overwrite files outside Koel's intended media storage.
    *   **Command Injection (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of command injection if filenames are used in system commands within Koel without proper sanitization.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large File Uploads (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion of the Koel server by limiting file sizes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload:** High risk reduction.
    *   **Directory Traversal:** High risk reduction.
    *   **Command Injection:** Medium risk reduction.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium risk reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Unknown:**  Likely some basic file type and extension checks are in place in Koel, but the level of sanitization and robustness needs verification by inspecting Koel's codebase. File size limits are common web server configurations and might be in place externally to Koel.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Robust MIME Type Detection in Koel:**  Ensure Koel uses content-based MIME type detection, not just file extensions.
    *   **Comprehensive Filename Sanitization in Koel:**  Implement thorough filename sanitization within Koel's upload handling logic.
    *   **Integrity Checks in Koel:**  Consider adding basic integrity checks within Koel's media file processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Media File Storage and Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/secure_media_file_storage_and_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Storage Outside Web Root for Koel Media:** Configure the web server so that the directory where Koel stores uploaded media files is outside the web server's document root. This prevents direct access via HTTP requests bypassing Koel.
    2.  **Application-Level Access Control in Koel:** Implement access control within the Koel application.  When a user requests a media file, Koel should verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access that file before serving it.
    3.  **Secure File Permissions for Koel Media Storage:** Set restrictive file system permissions on the media storage directory used by Koel. Ensure that only the web server process (and necessary system users) have read and write access. Prevent public read access.
    4.  **Consider Dedicated Storage/CDN for Koel Media:** Explore using cloud storage services or CDNs to store and serve Koel's media files. Configure access policies on these services to restrict access appropriately, managed by Koel.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Media Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from directly accessing and downloading Koel media files without going through Koel's access control mechanisms.
    *   **Data Breach (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches of Koel media files by limiting direct access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Media Access:** High risk reduction.
    *   **Data Breach:** Medium risk reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Koel likely stores media files in a directory accessible by the application, but verification is needed if it's outside the web root and if application-level access control within Koel is robust. File permissions are server configuration dependent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Verification of Koel Media Storage Location:** Confirm Koel media storage is outside the web root.
    *   **Detailed Access Control Audit in Koel:**  Thoroughly review and test Koel's access control logic for media files.
    *   **Consideration of Dedicated Storage/CDN for Koel:**  Evaluate the benefits of using dedicated storage or a CDN for Koel's media.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) for Media Playback](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__for_media_playback.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define CSP Directives for Koel:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header in Koel's web server configuration or application code.
    2.  **`media-src` Directive for Koel:**  Specifically configure the `media-src` directive in the CSP to restrict the sources from which Koel is allowed to load media files.  This should ideally be set to `'self'` or trusted CDN domains used by Koel.
    3.  **Test and Refine CSP for Koel:**  Thoroughly test the CSP to ensure it doesn't break Koel's media playback functionality while effectively blocking unwanted content.
    4.  **Report-URI (Optional but Recommended) for Koel:** Consider adding a `report-uri` or `report-to` directive to the CSP to receive reports of CSP violations specifically related to Koel.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) related to Media in Koel (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of XSS attacks within Koel where malicious scripts could be injected and executed in the context of media playback.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Medium risk reduction within Koel.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Unknown:**  It's unlikely that a strict CSP with `media-src` is currently implemented in Koel by default. CSP implementation is often a manual configuration step for web applications like Koel.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **CSP Header Implementation for Koel:**  Needs to implement the CSP header for the Koel application.
    *   **`media-src` Directive Configuration for Koel:**  Specifically configure the `media-src` directive to restrict media sources for Koel.
    *   **Testing and Refinement of CSP for Koel:**  Requires testing and refinement of the CSP in the context of Koel.
