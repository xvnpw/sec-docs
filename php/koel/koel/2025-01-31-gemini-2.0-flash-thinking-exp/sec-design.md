# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Koel project aims to provide a personal music streaming server, allowing users to host and stream their own music library.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for music streaming.
  - Enable users to access their personal music library from anywhere with internet access.
  - Offer a self-hosted alternative to commercial music streaming services, giving users control over their data and music.
  - Ensure reliable and performant music streaming.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Data breaches exposing user credentials and potentially music library metadata.
  - Service unavailability due to technical issues or security incidents.
  - Copyright infringement if users are not properly managing their music library and sharing practices.
  - Performance issues impacting user experience and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control User authentication is implemented to protect access to the music library and settings. (Likely implemented using username/password and session management, details need to be verified in the repository).
  - security control Authorization mechanisms are in place to control user access to different features and data. (Likely role-based access control, details need to be verified in the repository).
  - security control Input validation is expected to be implemented to prevent common web application vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. (Details need to be verified in the repository).
  - security control Secure password storage is expected to be implemented using hashing and salting. (Details need to be verified in the repository).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the project.
  - accepted risk Potential misconfigurations during deployment by end-users.
  - accepted risk Lack of formal security audits and penetration testing.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control Introduce rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
  - security control Enforce secure defaults for deployment configurations and provide security hardening guidelines for users.
  - security control Implement regular security testing, including static and dynamic analysis, and consider penetration testing.
  - security control Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
  - security control Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce secure connections.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement Securely authenticate users accessing the Koel web interface.
    - Requirement Support strong password policies and encourage users to choose strong passwords.
    - Requirement Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement Implement role-based access control to manage user permissions.
    - Requirement Ensure that users can only access and modify resources they are authorized to.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, command injection).
    - Requirement Sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the web interface.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement Securely store user passwords using strong hashing algorithms and salts.
    - Requirement Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the user's browser and the Koel server.
    - Requirement Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest, such as API keys or configuration settings.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment options for Koel can vary. Common scenarios include:

1.  **Local Machine Deployment:** Running Koel directly on a personal computer for local access.
2.  **Virtual Private Server (VPS) Deployment:** Deploying Koel on a VPS for wider internet accessibility.
3.  **Containerized Deployment (Docker):** Using Docker to containerize Koel and deploy it on various platforms, including cloud providers or personal servers.

We will focus on **Containerized Deployment (Docker)** as it is a common and flexible approach.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Music Streaming: Providing users with the ability to stream their music library. Disruption would impact user experience and the core functionality of Koel.
  - User Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring only authorized users can access and manage their music library. Failure could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
  - Music Library Management: Allowing users to manage their music library metadata and organization. Data loss or corruption would impact user experience.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - User Credentials (usernames, passwords, potentially API keys): Highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
  - Music Library Metadata (song titles, artists, albums, playlists): Sensitive. Personal data that users would expect to be kept private and secure.
  - User Preferences and Settings: Moderately sensitive. User-specific configurations that enhance user experience.
  - Music Files: Sensitivity depends on the user and the nature of their music library. Copyrighted material might have legal implications if exposed.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended scale of deployment (number of users, music library size)?
  - What are the specific data storage requirements and constraints?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) to consider?
  - What is the expected level of technical expertise of the users deploying and managing Koel?
  - Are there any plans for future integrations with external services (e.g., music APIs, cloud storage)?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - Koel is primarily intended for personal use or small groups of users.
    - The primary goal is to provide a functional and user-friendly music streaming experience.
    - Data privacy and security are important but not necessarily under strict regulatory compliance.
  - SECURITY POSTURE:
    - Basic security controls are in place, but there is room for improvement.
    - Security is a concern, but the project may not have dedicated security resources.
    - Users are expected to have some level of technical understanding for deployment and security configuration.
  - DESIGN:
    - The architecture is relatively simple and based on common web application patterns.
    - Containerization (Docker) is a preferred deployment method for flexibility and ease of management.
    - The build process can be enhanced with more robust security checks and automation.
