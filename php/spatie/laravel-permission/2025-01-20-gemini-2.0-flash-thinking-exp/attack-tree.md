## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access or Elevate Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_or_elevate_privileges.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete compromise of the application's security model related to authorization. Success here means the attacker has bypassed all intended access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Role/Permission Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rolepermission_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

* This path focuses on weaknesses in how roles and permissions are assigned to users. Successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining unauthorized privileges.
    * Direct Database Manipulation: As detailed above, this allows for direct manipulation of role assignments.
    * Parameter Tampering during Role/Permission Assignment: Attackers can modify HTTP request parameters (e.g., form data, API requests) to assign themselves or others unauthorized roles or permissions. This often occurs when input validation is insufficient.
    * Insecure API Endpoints for Role/Permission Management: If API endpoints responsible for managing roles and permissions lack proper authentication or authorization, attackers can use them to grant themselves elevated privileges. Insecure data validation on these endpoints can also lead to unintended assignments.
    * Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities: If the models used for assigning roles and permissions are not properly protected against mass assignment, attackers can include unexpected fields in requests to modify role or permission assignments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Database Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/direct_database_manipulation.md)

* This node represents a critical point of compromise because direct access to the database allows the attacker to bypass all application logic and directly manipulate the underlying role and permission data.
    * Exploit SQL Injection in Custom Queries (if any): Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into vulnerable custom queries to read, modify, or delete data in the database, including role and permission assignments.
    * Gain Direct Database Access (e.g., compromised credentials): If an attacker obtains database credentials, they can directly connect to the database and manipulate role and permission tables.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Tampering during Role/Permission Assignment](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_tampering_during_rolepermission_assignment.md)

* This path focuses on weaknesses in how roles and permissions are assigned to users. Successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining unauthorized privileges.
        * Parameter Tampering during Role/Permission Assignment: Attackers can modify HTTP request parameters (e.g., form data, API requests) to assign themselves or others unauthorized roles or permissions. This often occurs when input validation is insufficient.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure API Endpoints for Role/Permission Management](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_api_endpoints_for_rolepermission_management.md)

* This path focuses on weaknesses in how roles and permissions are assigned to users. Successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining unauthorized privileges.
        * Insecure API Endpoints for Role/Permission Management: If API endpoints responsible for managing roles and permissions lack proper authentication or authorization, attackers can use them to grant themselves elevated privileges. Insecure data validation on these endpoints can also lead to unintended assignments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

* This path focuses on weaknesses in how roles and permissions are assigned to users. Successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining unauthorized privileges.
        * Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities: If the models used for assigning roles and permissions are not properly protected against mass assignment, attackers can include unexpected fields in requests to modify role or permission assignments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Permission Checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_permission_checks.md)

* This path focuses on circumventing the mechanisms designed to enforce authorization. Successful exploitation allows attackers to access resources or perform actions they are not intended to.
        * Exploit Weaknesses in Middleware Implementation:
            * Incorrectly configured or bypassed middleware: If middleware responsible for enforcing role or permission checks is not correctly configured or can be bypassed due to flaws in route definitions or custom middleware logic, attackers can gain unauthorized access to protected routes.
        * Exploit Weaknesses in `can()` Method Usage:
            * Incorrectly implemented or missing checks using `can()`: If the `can()` method is used incorrectly in the application's code (e.g., logic errors in conditional statements) or if permission checks are missing altogether, attackers can bypass authorization controls and perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Middleware Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_middleware_implementation.md)

* This path focuses on circumventing the mechanisms designed to enforce authorization. Successful exploitation allows attackers to access resources or perform actions they are not intended to.
        * Exploit Weaknesses in Middleware Implementation:
            * Incorrectly configured or bypassed middleware: If middleware responsible for enforcing role or permission checks is not correctly configured or can be bypassed due to flaws in route definitions or custom middleware logic, attackers can gain unauthorized access to protected routes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in `can()` Method Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in__can____method_usage.md)

* This path focuses on circumventing the mechanisms designed to enforce authorization. Successful exploitation allows attackers to access resources or perform actions they are not intended to.
        * Exploit Weaknesses in `can()` Method Usage:
            * Incorrectly implemented or missing checks using `can()`: If the `can()` method is used incorrectly in the application's code (e.g., logic errors in conditional statements) or if permission checks are missing altogether, attackers can bypass authorization controls and perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrectly implemented or missing checks using `can()`](./attack_tree_paths/incorrectly_implemented_or_missing_checks_using__can___.md)

* This path focuses on circumventing the mechanisms designed to enforce authorization. Successful exploitation allows attackers to access resources or perform actions they are not intended to.
        * Exploit Weaknesses in `can()` Method Usage:
            * Incorrectly implemented or missing checks using `can()`: If the `can()` method is used incorrectly in the application's code (e.g., logic errors in conditional statements) or if permission checks are missing altogether, attackers can bypass authorization controls and perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implicit Permissions or Assumptions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implicit_permissions_or_assumptions.md)

* This path involves exploiting situations where the application assumes a user has certain permissions based on other factors (e.g., group membership, subscription status) without explicitly checking the permissions managed by Laravel Permission. This can create loopholes that attackers can exploit to gain unintended access.
