# Threat Model Analysis for spatie/laravel-permission

## Threat: [Incorrect Guard Configuration](./threats/incorrect_guard_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Guard Configuration leading to Authorization Bypass.
*   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities. This happens when the application is misconfigured to use the wrong authentication guard in permission checks. For example, if a route intended for authenticated users is checked against a guest guard or a different user type's guard, the authorization will fail to correctly identify the user's permissions, potentially allowing anyone to bypass access controls.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, functionalities, or administrative panels. Potential data breaches, data manipulation, and system compromise.
*   **Affected Laravel-Permission Component:** Configuration (`config/permission.php`, `config/auth.php`), Middleware, `HasPermissions` trait, Blade directives (`@can`, `@cannot`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration Review:** Carefully review `config/permission.php` and `config/auth.php` to ensure guards are correctly defined and aligned with application logic.
    *   **Guard Specification:** Explicitly specify the correct guard in all permission checks using methods like `->hasPermissionTo($permission, $guardName)` or `@can('permission', [], $guardName)`.
    *   **Testing:** Implement thorough integration tests that cover different user roles and guards to verify authorization enforcement under various configurations.
    *   **Consistent Naming:** Use clear and consistent naming conventions for guards to minimize confusion and misconfiguration.


## Threat: [Unauthorized Role/Permission Assignment](./threats/unauthorized_rolepermission_assignment.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation through Role/Permission Manipulation.
*   **Description:** An attacker could elevate their privileges or those of other users by exploiting vulnerabilities in the role and permission management system. If the interface for assigning roles and permissions is not adequately protected, or if there are flaws in the assignment logic (e.g., injection vulnerabilities, lack of authorization checks on the management interface itself), an attacker could manipulate requests to grant themselves administrative roles or permissions, leading to full control over the application.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including data breaches, data manipulation, account takeover, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Laravel-Permission Component:** Role and Permission Management Controllers/Logic, Database Seeding, `Role` and `Permission` models, `assignRole`, `givePermissionTo` functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Access Control for Management:** Implement robust authorization checks using `laravel-permission` itself to protect role and permission management routes and functionalities. Only authorized administrators should be able to manage roles and permissions.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize user input when creating, updating, or assigning roles and permissions to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, mass assignment).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design role and permission management interfaces with the principle of least privilege in mind. Limit access to only necessary functionalities for administrators.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Implement comprehensive audit logging for all role and permission changes to track modifications and detect unauthorized activities.


## Threat: [IDOR via Permission Misconfiguration](./threats/idor_via_permission_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via Permission Misconfiguration.
*   **Description:** An attacker could access or manipulate resources they are not authorized to access by directly referencing object IDs. This occurs when permission checks are not properly scoped to specific resources. For example, if a permission check only verifies "edit post" without checking if the user has permission to edit *that specific post*, an attacker could modify posts belonging to other users by manipulating the post ID in the request.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to and manipulation of resources, data breaches, data corruption, and potential system compromise.
*   **Affected Laravel-Permission Component:** Permission checking logic, Policies, Gates, Resource-based authorization implementation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource-Based Authorization:** Implement resource-based authorization. Ensure permission checks are scoped to specific resources or objects, not just general actions.
    *   **Policies and Gates:** Utilize Laravel Policies and Gates to define fine-grained authorization rules that consider the specific resource being accessed.
    *   **Contextual Permission Checks:** When checking permissions, always verify not just the general permission but also the user's authorization to access the specific resource instance. Pass the resource object to the permission check (e.g., `@can('update', $post)`).
    *   **Input Validation and Authorization on Resource IDs:** Validate and authorize access to resource IDs in requests to prevent manipulation and ensure users are only accessing resources they are permitted to access.
