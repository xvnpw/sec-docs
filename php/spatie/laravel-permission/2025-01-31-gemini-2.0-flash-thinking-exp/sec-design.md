# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the `spatie/laravel-permission` Laravel package, aims to simplify and enhance the management of user roles and permissions within Laravel applications. It addresses the business need for robust and flexible access control, ensuring that users can only access the resources and functionalities they are authorized to use.

Business priorities this package addresses:
- Implement fine-grained access control to protect sensitive data and functionalities.
- Improve application security by enforcing the principle of least privilege.
- Enhance user management and administration capabilities.
- Support compliance requirements related to data access and authorization.
- Increase development efficiency by providing a reusable and well-tested solution for permissions management.

Most important business risks to be addressed:
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data or application functionalities, leading to data breaches or operational disruptions.
- Privilege escalation, where users gain access beyond their intended authorization level.
- Compliance violations due to inadequate access controls, resulting in legal and financial penalties.
- Operational inefficiencies and increased administrative overhead if access control is complex and difficult to manage.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control Laravel framework's built-in security features, including protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection). Implemented within the Laravel framework itself.
- security control Authentication mechanisms provided by Laravel, such as session-based authentication or Passport for API authentication. Implemented within the Laravel application using Laravel's authentication features.
- security control Database security measures, including access controls, encryption at rest and in transit, and regular backups. Implemented at the database server level and application configuration.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk Potential vulnerabilities in the Laravel framework or underlying PHP runtime. Mitigated by keeping Laravel and PHP versions up to date.
- accepted risk Misconfiguration of the package or the Laravel application leading to unintended access control bypasses. Mitigated by thorough testing and security reviews.
- accepted risk Supply chain risks associated with third-party dependencies. Mitigated by using reputable package repositories and performing dependency vulnerability scanning.

Recommended security controls:
- security control Implement automated security testing, including unit tests and integration tests that specifically cover authorization logic.
- security control Conduct regular security code reviews of the application code, focusing on areas where permissions are enforced.
- security control Implement logging and monitoring of authorization events to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
- security control Follow secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle, including input validation and output encoding where applicable in authorization logic.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: The package relies on the application's authentication system to identify users. It does not provide its own authentication mechanism. The application must ensure strong authentication practices are in place.
- Authorization: The primary purpose of this package is authorization. It must provide a robust and flexible mechanism to define and enforce permissions and roles, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources or perform actions. Authorization decisions should be consistently applied across the application.
- Input Validation: While the package itself doesn't directly handle user input, the application using it must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks that could potentially bypass authorization checks or manipulate permissions indirectly.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for this package's functionality. However, if sensitive data related to roles or permissions is stored, encryption at rest should be considered at the database level. Secure communication channels (HTTPS) are essential to protect authorization tokens and session data in transit.

    class Developer,CodeRepository,CI,BuildArtifacts,DeploymentEnvironment,BuildProcess,SecurityChecks element
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code for the Laravel application and the integration with the `spatie/laravel-permission` package.
2. Code Repository (GitHub): Code is committed and pushed to a Git repository hosted on GitHub.
3. CI/CD System (GitHub Actions): Upon code changes, GitHub Actions, a CI/CD system, is triggered to automate the build process.
4. Build Process (Composer, Tests, Linters):
    - Composer is used to manage PHP dependencies, including the `spatie/laravel-permission` package.
    - Automated tests (unit, integration) are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Linters and code style checkers are run to enforce coding standards and identify potential code quality issues.
5. Security Checks (SAST, Dependency Scan):
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency scanning tools are used to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including the `spatie/laravel-permission` package and its dependencies.
6. Build Artifacts (Composer Packages): If the build process and security checks are successful, build artifacts are created. In the context of a Laravel application, these artifacts are typically the application code and dependencies managed by Composer.
7. Deployment Environment: Build artifacts are then deployed to the target deployment environment (e.g., cloud-based web hosting).

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control Secure Code Repository: Access control to the code repository, branch protection, and audit logging of code changes.
- security control CI/CD Pipeline Security: Secure configuration of the CI/CD pipeline, access control to CI/CD workflows and secrets, and audit logging of CI/CD activities.
- security control Dependency Management: Using Composer's `composer.lock` file to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent dependency confusion attacks.
- security control Automated Testing: Unit tests and integration tests to verify the functionality and security of the application and authorization logic.
- security control Static Application Security Testing (SAST): SAST tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase early in the development lifecycle.
- security control Dependency Vulnerability Scanning: Tools to scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and alert developers to update or mitigate risks.
- security control Build Artifact Integrity: Signing or checksumming build artifacts to ensure integrity and prevent tampering during deployment.
- security control Secret Management: Securely managing and storing sensitive credentials (API keys, database passwords) used in the build and deployment process, using CI/CD secrets management features.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- User authentication and authorization: Ensuring only authenticated and authorized users can access specific application features and data.
- Data access control: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.
- Administrative functions: Securing administrative access to manage users, roles, permissions, and application configurations.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- User data (personal information, profiles): Sensitive data requiring confidentiality and integrity. Unauthorized access or modification can lead to privacy violations and reputational damage.
- Application data (business-critical information): Sensitivity depends on the nature of the application. Unauthorized access or modification can lead to financial loss, operational disruption, and compliance violations.
- Permission configurations (roles, permissions, assignments): Sensitive data that, if compromised, can lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Requires confidentiality and integrity.
