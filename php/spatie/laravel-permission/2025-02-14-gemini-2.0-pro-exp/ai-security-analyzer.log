An attacker can modify these identifiers to attempt to access resources or perform actions associated with different roles or permissions.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   A URL like `/admin/users/edit/1?role_id=2` might allow an attacker to change `role_id` to `3` (an administrator role ID) to gain unauthorized access.\n    *   **Likelihood:** Medium\n    *   **Impact:** High\n    *   **Effort:** Low\n    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate\n    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium\n    *   **Mitigation:**\n        *   Never expose internal IDs directly. Use UUIDs or other non-sequential identifiers.\n        *   Always validate user input against expected values and the user's *current* permissions.\n        *   Use Laravel's built-in authorization features (gates and policies) to centralize authorization logic.\n\n*   **[1.3 Logic Flaws in Role/Permission Assignment] [HR]**\n    *   **Description:** Errors in the application's code that assigns roles and permissions. This could be due to bugs, incorrect conditional statements, or flawed business logic.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   A new user registration process might accidentally assign the \"admin\" role to all new users due to a coding error.\n        *   A feature that allows users to request role upgrades might have flawed validation, allowing users to request any role.\n    *   **Likelihood:** Medium\n    *   **Impact:** High\n    *   **Effort:** Low\n    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate\n    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium\n    *   **Mitigation:**\n        *   Implement strict validation and authorization checks *before* assigning roles or permissions.\n        *   Use Laravel's built-in form request validation and authorization.\n        *   Implement robust logging and auditing of role/permission changes.\n        *   Thorough code reviews and testing."

This is similar to 1.3, but the attacker already has some level of access and is trying to gain higher privileges.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   A user with a \"moderator\" role might find a way to exploit a role upgrade request feature to gain \"admin\" privileges.\n    *   **Likelihood:** Medium\n    *   **Impact:** High\n    *   **Effort:** Low\n    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate\n    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium\n    *   **Mitigation:**\n        *   Same as 1.3: Strict validation, authorization checks, logging, auditing, code reviews, and testing.\n\n*   **[2.2 Abuse Permission Assignment Logic] [HR]**\n    *   **Description:** Similar to 2.1, but focused on direct permission assignments rather than roles. The attacker exploits flaws in the logic that grants permissions.\n    *   **Example:**\n        *   If the application allows users to manage some permissions (even limited ones), a flawed implementation could allow them to grant themselves elevated permissions.\n    *   **Likelihood:** Medium\n    *   **Impact:** High\n    *   **Effort:** Low\n    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate\n    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium\n    *   **Mitigation:**\n        *   Same as 1.3 and 2.1: Strict validation, authorization checks, logging, auditing, code reviews, and testing."
