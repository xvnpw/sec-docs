# Attack Tree Analysis for spatie/laravel-permission

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions beyond the attacker's intended privileges by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the `spatie/laravel-permission` implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Bypass Permission Checks](./attack_tree_paths/1__bypass_permission_checks.md)

*   **1.1 Logic Flaws:**
    *   **1.1.1 Incorrect Implementation (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** The developer has made mistakes in how they use the `spatie/laravel-permission` API. This could include:
            *   Typos in permission or role names.
            *   Incorrect logic in conditional statements using `hasPermissionTo()`, `hasRole()`, or similar methods.
            *   Misunderstanding the "and"/"or" behavior when checking for multiple permissions or roles.
            *   Incorrect use of Blade directives like `@can` and `@role`.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
        *   **Impact:** High (Directly bypasses security)
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate-Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Thorough code reviews of all code using the package.
            *   Comprehensive unit and integration tests, covering both positive and negative cases.
            *   Clear documentation on how permissions and roles are used.

*   **1.2 Direct Object Reference (DOR) Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **1.2.1 Bypassing Middleware/Gates (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker directly accesses routes or controller actions, circumventing the middleware or gates that are supposed to enforce permission checks. This happens when routes are not properly protected.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Ensure *all* routes requiring authorization are protected by `can` middleware, `role` middleware, or gates.
            *   Use a "deny-by-default" approach to route protection.
            *   Regularly audit route definitions.
            *   Consider centralized authorization logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Role/Permission Assignment](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_rolepermission_assignment.md)

*   **2.2 Insufficient Authorization for Role/Permission Management:**
    *   **2.2.1 Weak Admin Password/Compromised Admin Account (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to an administrative account, allowing them to manipulate roles and permissions. This is often due to weak passwords, phishing, or other account compromise methods.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control over permissions)
        *   **Effort:** Low-High (Varies greatly depending on the attack method)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice-Expert (Varies greatly)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy-Very Hard (Depends on monitoring and intrusion detection)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all administrative accounts.
            *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrative accounts.
            *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege for admin accounts.
            *   Implement secure session management practices.
            *   Implement and monitor audit logs for role/permission changes.
