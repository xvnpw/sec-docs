# Threat Model Analysis for spatie/laravel-permission

## Threat: [Role Escalation via Direct Database Manipulation](./threats/role_escalation_via_direct_database_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the database (e.g., through a separate SQL injection vulnerability or compromised credentials) and directly modifies the `model_has_roles` or `role_has_permissions` tables to assign themselves a higher-privilege role (like "Admin").  This bypasses the package's intended authorization flow.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains full administrative control over the application, potentially able to access sensitive data, modify user accounts, or even take the application offline.
*   **Affected Component:** Database tables: `model_has_roles`, `role_has_permissions`, `roles`. *While the package doesn't directly cause this, it relies on the integrity of these tables.*
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Database Security:** Implement strong database security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection, strong passwords, least-privilege database user accounts). This is *paramount* as the package relies on a secure database.
    *   **SQL Injection Prevention:** Prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities throughout the *entire* application (not just the parts using this package).
    *   **Database Auditing:** Regularly audit database access logs for suspicious activity.
    *   **Data Backups:** Maintain regular, secure backups to allow for recovery in case of a successful attack.

## Threat: [Permission Escalation via Direct Database Manipulation](./threats/permission_escalation_via_direct_database_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to role escalation, but the attacker directly modifies the `model_has_permissions` table to grant themselves specific permissions without needing to change their role. This bypasses the package's intended authorization flow.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains access to specific functionalities or data protected by the assigned permissions, potentially bypassing intended role-based restrictions.
*   **Affected Component:** Database table: `model_has_permissions`. *The package relies on the integrity of this table.*
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** (Same as Role Escalation via Direct Database Manipulation)
    *   **Database Security:** Implement strong database security measures.
    *   **SQL Injection Prevention:** Prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Database Auditing:** Regularly audit database access logs.
    *   **Data Backups:** Maintain regular, secure backups.

## Threat: [Wildcard Permission Abuse](./threats/wildcard_permission_abuse.md)

*   **Description:**  A developer uses the wildcard character (`*`) in `givePermissionTo` too broadly (e.g., `$role->givePermissionTo('*')`), granting a role access to all existing and *future* permissions. This is a direct misuse of a package feature.
*   **Impact:**  A role unintentionally gains access to a wide range of functionalities, potentially including sensitive operations, as new permissions are added to the system.  This can lead to unintended privilege escalation over time.
*   **Affected Component:**  The `givePermissionTo` method and the way permissions are assigned to roles *within the package's API*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Wildcards:** Avoid using wildcards when assigning permissions unless absolutely necessary and fully understood.
    *   **Explicit Permissions:**  Explicitly define and assign individual permissions to roles.
    *   **Regular Review:** If wildcards are used, regularly review them to ensure they remain appropriate and haven't become overly permissive.

## Threat: [Package Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/package_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a newly discovered vulnerability in the `spatie/laravel-permission` package itself. This is a direct threat to the package.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The `spatie/laravel-permission` package itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability), potentially Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Keep the package updated to the latest version. Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly.
    *   **Monitor Advisories:** Monitor security advisories and community forums related to the package.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (like Composer) to track and manage package versions.
