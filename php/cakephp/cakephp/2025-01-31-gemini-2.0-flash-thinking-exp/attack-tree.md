## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known CakePHP Framework Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_cakephp_framework_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the CakePHP framework itself.
*   **Critical Node: Execute Exploit to Achieve Desired Impact:**
    *   Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities (e.g., Remote Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection *if framework related*) in specific CakePHP versions.
    *   Exploits are often publicly available or can be developed based on CVE details.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to critical impact, including full application compromise, data breaches, and remote code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting common misconfigurations in CakePHP applications.

    *   **2.1. Debug Mode Enabled in Production (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Critical Node: Leverage Debug Information Leakage:**
            *   Debug mode exposes sensitive information in error pages and debug output.
            *   **Critical Node: Expose Sensitive Configuration Details:**
                *   Debug output can reveal database credentials, security salts, API keys, and other sensitive configuration parameters.
                *   This direct leakage of credentials can lead to immediate and critical compromise.

    *   **2.2. Insecure Database Configuration (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Critical Node: Default Database Credentials:** Using default credentials for database access.
            *   **Critical Node: Weak Database Passwords:** Employing easily guessable or brute-forceable database passwords.
            *   **Critical Node: Database Exposed to Public Network:** Allowing direct public access to the database server.
        *   **Impact:** All these vectors can lead to direct, unauthorized access to the application's database, resulting in full data breaches and potential further system compromise.

    *   **2.3. Insecure Security Salt Configuration (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Critical Node: Default or Weak Security Salts:** Using default or easily guessable security salts for password hashing. This weakens password security and facilitates password cracking.
            *   **Critical Node: Security Salts Exposed:**  Accidentally exposing security salts in public repositories, debug output, or other publicly accessible locations. This completely breaks password hashing security, making password cracking trivial.

    *   **2.4. Misconfigured Security Headers (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Critical Node: Missing or Weak Security Headers:** Not implementing or incorrectly configuring security headers like HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and Content-Security-Policy.
        *   **Critical Node: Facilitate XSS Attacks:** Missing CSP and X-XSS-Protection headers significantly increase the risk and impact of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit CakePHP ORM Misuse - Mass Assignment (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_cakephp_orm_misuse_-_mass_assignment__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Mass Assignment vulnerabilities due to improper handling of user input in CakePHP's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).
*   **Critical Node: Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:**
    *   If developers don't properly control which fields can be mass-assigned, attackers can inject unexpected fields in request data.
    *   **Critical Node: Modify Protected or Hidden Fields:** Attackers can modify protected or hidden fields like `is_admin` or `user_id` in other users' contexts, leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit CakePHP Component/Helper/Behavior Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_cakephp_componenthelperbehavior_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party plugins/components or custom-developed components, helpers, and behaviors.

    *   **4.1. Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins/Components (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in Outdated or Vulnerable Plugins/Components:**
            *   Third-party plugins and components can contain vulnerabilities, especially if they are outdated or poorly maintained.
            *   Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to a wide range of impacts, from data breaches to Remote Code Execution, depending on the plugin's functionality.

    *   **4.2. Vulnerabilities in Custom Components/Helpers/Behaviors (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Critical Node: Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities:**
            *   Developer-introduced vulnerabilities in custom code (components, helpers, behaviors) are a significant risk.
            *   Common vulnerabilities include XSS, SQL Injection, and logic errors introduced during custom development.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Routing and Dispatcher Issues - Authorization Bypass (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_routing_and_dispatcher_issues_-_authorization_bypass__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing authorization checks due to misconfigurations or flaws in routing and dispatcher logic.
*   **Critical Node: Access Actions Without Proper Authorization Checks:**
    *   If authorization checks are not correctly implemented in all relevant actions, attackers can directly access sensitive actions without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   This leads to unauthorized access to functionality and data, potentially allowing data manipulation or privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Session Management Weaknesses (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_session_management_weaknesses__high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in session management to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

    *   **6.1. Session Fixation (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Critical Node: Impersonate Victim's Session:**
            *   Session fixation allows an attacker to force a victim to use a known session ID.
            *   Once the victim authenticates with the fixed session ID, the attacker can impersonate the victim's session and gain full account access.

    *   **6.2. Session Hijacking (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):**
        *   **Critical Node: Intercept Session Cookies:**
            *   Session hijacking involves intercepting a valid session cookie, often through Man-in-the-Middle attacks or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
        *   **Critical Node: Replay Session Cookie to Impersonate User:**
            *   Once the session cookie is intercepted, the attacker can replay it to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized account access.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities - Unrestricted File Upload Type (High-Risk Path & Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/7__exploit_file_upload_vulnerabilities_-_unrestricted_file_upload_type__high-risk_path_&_critical_no_16f40f95.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting file upload functionality that lacks proper restrictions on file types.
*   **Critical Node: Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Critical Node: Unrestricted File Upload Type:** If the application does not properly validate file types, attackers can upload malicious files.
    *   **Critical Node: Upload Malicious File:** Attackers upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts or executables.
    *   **Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution:** If the uploaded malicious file can be executed by the server (e.g., if uploaded to a web-accessible directory and executed), it leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), granting the attacker full control over the server.
