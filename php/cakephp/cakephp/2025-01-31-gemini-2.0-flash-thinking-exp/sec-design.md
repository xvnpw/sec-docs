# BUSINESS POSTURE

CakePHP is an open-source rapid development framework for PHP. Its primary business priority is to provide a robust, secure, and easy-to-use framework that enables developers to build web applications efficiently. The goal is to empower developers to create high-quality web applications quickly, reducing development time and complexity.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in the framework itself, which could be exploited in applications built with CakePHP.
- Risk of poor documentation or lack of community support, hindering adoption and developer productivity.
- Risk of the framework becoming outdated or incompatible with newer PHP versions or technologies.
- Risk of performance issues in applications built with CakePHP due to framework inefficiencies.
- Risk of legal issues related to licensing or intellectual property if not properly managed.

# SECURITY POSTURE

security control: Code reviews are conducted by core team members for contributions to the framework. (Implemented in: GitHub pull request process)
security control: Automated testing including unit and integration tests are part of the development process. (Implemented in: GitHub Actions CI)
security control: Security advisories are published for known vulnerabilities. (Implemented in: CakePHP Security Advisories page and GitHub Security Advisories)
accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.
accepted risk: Potential delay in patching vulnerabilities due to the open-source nature and volunteer-driven maintenance.

recommended security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
recommended security control: Regularly perform dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
recommended security control: Establish a clear security incident response plan for handling reported vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: While CakePHP itself doesn't enforce a specific authentication mechanism, applications built with CakePHP will require robust authentication to verify user identities. This is typically implemented within the application layer using CakePHP's authentication components or third-party libraries.
- Authorization: Applications built with CakePHP must implement authorization mechanisms to control user access to resources and functionalities. CakePHP provides tools for building authorization logic within applications.
- Input Validation: CakePHP applications must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). CakePHP provides input validation features and encourages developers to use them.
- Cryptography: CakePHP applications should use cryptography to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest. CakePHP provides utilities for encryption and hashing, and applications should leverage these or secure cryptographic libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing a secure and reliable framework for web application development.
- Maintaining the framework's functionality and compatibility.
- Supporting the CakePHP developer community.

Data Sensitivity:
- Source code of the CakePHP framework (Medium sensitivity - public repository, but integrity is important).
- Security vulnerability information (High sensitivity - needs to be handled confidentially until a patch is available).
- User data on the CakePHP website (Low to Medium sensitivity - depends on the type of data collected, e.g., forum posts, user accounts).
- Build artifacts (Medium sensitivity - integrity and availability are important).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific security tools currently used in the CakePHP CI/CD pipeline (SAST, dependency scanning)?
- Is there a formal security incident response plan in place for CakePHP?
- Are build artifacts signed to ensure integrity?
- What is the process for managing and disclosing security vulnerabilities?

Assumptions:
- CakePHP project prioritizes security and aims to provide a secure framework.
- The development team follows secure coding practices.
- The community plays a role in identifying and reporting security issues.
- The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Deployment is assumed to be cloud-based using containers and orchestration for scalability and resilience.
