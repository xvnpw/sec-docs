## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Authentication/Authorization via Routing](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_authenticationauthorization_via_routing.md)

* Attackers analyze route configurations to find routes that lack proper authentication or authorization checks.
* By directly accessing these unprotected routes, they can bypass intended security measures and gain unauthorized access to functionalities or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

* Attackers identify models where the `_accessible` property is not properly configured, allowing modification of unintended fields.
* They craft malicious requests containing data for these protected fields.
* Upon saving, the application unintentionally updates these fields, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Data Handling in Controllers](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_data_handling_in_controllers.md)

* Attackers target controller actions that directly use user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation.
* They craft malicious input designed to exploit vulnerabilities like command injection (executing arbitrary commands on the server) or path traversal (accessing unauthorized files).
* By triggering these vulnerable actions, attackers can gain control of the server or access sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing CSRF Protection](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_csrf_protection.md)

* Attackers analyze the implementation of CakePHP's CSRF protection to identify weaknesses (e.g., missing token checks, predictable tokens).
* They craft malicious requests that either don't include a valid CSRF token or use a predictable one.
* This allows them to perform state-changing actions on behalf of legitimate users without their knowledge.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

* Attackers analyze the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., AuthComponent, custom middleware) to find flaws.
* They exploit vulnerabilities like logic errors, insecure session handling, or weak password policies to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_tree_paths/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

* Attackers identify applications running with debug mode enabled in production environments.
* They access debug information, which often reveals sensitive details like database credentials, file paths, and error messages.
* This information can be used to launch further, more targeted attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Database Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_database_credentials.md)

* Attackers discover database credentials stored insecurely (e.g., plain text in configuration files, exposed in version control).
* They gain access to these credentials.
* Using these credentials, they can directly access and manipulate the application's database, leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete data loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known CakePHP Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_cakephp_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attackers identify the specific version of CakePHP used by the application.
* They research publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with that version.
* They utilize available exploits or techniques to leverage these vulnerabilities, potentially gaining code execution or access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins.md)

* Attackers identify the third-party plugins used by the application.
* They research known vulnerabilities in these plugins.
* They utilize available exploits or techniques to leverage these vulnerabilities, potentially gaining code execution or access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server.md)

This is the ultimate goal of many attackers, allowing them to take complete control of the application and the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steps leading directly to Code Execution, Data Breach, or Privilege Escalation](./attack_tree_paths/steps_leading_directly_to_code_execution__data_breach__or_privilege_escalation.md)

These represent the points where the most significant damage occurs, making them critical to prevent. Examples include triggering command injection, accessing sensitive data due to debug mode, or escalating privileges via mass assignment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Controller/Model Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_controllermodel_vulnerabilities.md)

This represents a broad category of common web application vulnerabilities related to data handling and business logic, making it a critical area to secure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit View/Templating Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_viewtemplating_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

While potentially less common than controller/model issues, successful exploitation can lead to code execution via SSTI or through vulnerable helpers/components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Component/Middleware Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_componentmiddleware_weaknesses.md)

These components are designed to protect the application, so vulnerabilities here directly undermine its security posture.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

Misconfigurations are often easy to exploit and can have widespread and severe consequences, such as exposing sensitive credentials or enabling debug mode in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in CakePHP Core or Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cakephp_core_or_plugins.md)

These represent weaknesses in the framework or its extensions, which can have a broad impact on applications using them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steps involving access to sensitive credentials](./attack_tree_paths/steps_involving_access_to_sensitive_credentials.md)

Gaining access to credentials like database passwords is a critical step for attackers, as it allows them to directly access and manipulate sensitive data.
