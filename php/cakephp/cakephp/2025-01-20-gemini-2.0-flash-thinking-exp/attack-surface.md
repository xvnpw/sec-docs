# Attack Surface Analysis for cakephp/cakephp

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify unintended model attributes by including them in the request data when creating or updating entities.
*   **How CakePHP Contributes:** CakePHP's ORM, by default, allows setting entity properties based on request data. If not properly configured, this can lead to unintended data modification.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a POST request to update a user profile, including an `is_admin` field with a value of `true`, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges if the `is_admin` field is not protected.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use the `$fields` option in `patchEntity()` or `newEntity()` to explicitly specify which fields can be modified.
    *   Define the `$_accessible` property in your entity to control which properties are mass assignable.
    *   Utilize Form Objects to handle data transfer and validation, providing a layer of abstraction and control.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unescaped_output.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
*   **How CakePHP Contributes:** If developers do not properly escape data before rendering it in view templates, user-supplied or database-stored content containing malicious scripts can be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Example:** A user submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If this comment is displayed in a view using `<?= $comment->text ?>` without escaping, the script will execute in the browsers of other users viewing the comment.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use CakePHP's built-in escaping functions (e.g., `h()` or `e()`) when outputting data in view templates. For example: `<?= h($comment->text) ?>`.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **How CakePHP Contributes:** While CakePHP's ORM provides protection against SQL injection through parameterized queries, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities by using raw SQL queries or by improperly constructing queries using the query builder.
*   **Example:** A controller action constructs a SQL query using user-supplied input without proper sanitization: `$conn->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $this->request->getQuery('username') . "'");`. An attacker could provide a malicious username like `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, potential server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use CakePHP's ORM and its query builder, which automatically handles parameter binding. For example: `$users = $this->Users->find()->where(['username' => $this->request->getQuery('username')])->toArray();`.
    *   Avoid using raw SQL queries whenever possible. If necessary, use parameterized queries with proper escaping.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated users into unknowingly submitting malicious requests on the application, potentially performing actions on their behalf.
*   **How CakePHP Contributes:** If CakePHP's built-in CSRF protection is not properly implemented or is disabled, the application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link or form that, when clicked by an authenticated user, sends a request to the application to change the user's password without their knowledge. This relies on the application not verifying the origin of the request using a CSRF token.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, data modification, account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure CakePHP's CSRF middleware is enabled in your application's middleware stack.
    *   Use CakePHP's FormHelper, which automatically includes CSRF tokens in forms. For example: `<?= $this->Form->create() ?>`.
    *   For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files to the server, which can lead to various vulnerabilities, including remote code execution, path traversal, and denial of service.
*   **How CakePHP Contributes:** If file uploads are handled within CakePHP controllers without proper validation and sanitization, attackers can upload executable files or files that can overwrite critical system files.
*   **Example:** A controller action saves an uploaded file without checking its type or renaming it. An attacker uploads a PHP script, and if the server is configured to execute PHP in the upload directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data storage abuse, denial of service, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate file types and extensions on the server-side within your CakePHP controller logic. Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
    *   Rename uploaded files using CakePHP's file handling utilities or custom logic to prevent naming collisions and make it harder to guess file paths.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot to prevent direct execution by the web server.
    *   Implement file size limits within your CakePHP controller.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** Weak authentication mechanisms or flawed authorization logic allow unauthorized access to resources or actions.
*   **How CakePHP Contributes:** While CakePHP provides tools for authentication and authorization through its Authentication and Authorization libraries, developers might misconfigure these or implement flawed logic within their controllers or authorization adapters.
*   **Example:** A controller action uses a custom authorization check that incorrectly grants access to users who should not have it, bypassing the intended access controls defined using CakePHP's Authorization library.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionality, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize CakePHP's Authentication and Authorization libraries to implement robust access control. Follow the documentation and best practices for configuration and usage.
    *   Carefully define roles and permissions and ensure they are correctly enforced within your CakePHP application.
    *   Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization logic within your controllers and authorization adapters.
