## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities -> Unintended Action Access -> Manipulate Routing Parameters -> Exploit Missing Authorization Checks](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities_-_unintended_action_access_-_manipulate_routing_parameters_-_exploit_b100491d.md)

Attackers manipulate URL parameters to access controller actions without proper authorization checks. This occurs when developers fail to implement sufficient safeguards to ensure only authorized users can execute specific functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ORM/Database Interaction Weaknesses -> ORM Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ormdatabase_interaction_weaknesses_-_orm_injection.md)

Attackers inject malicious code into ORM queries, leading to unintended database operations. This often happens when developers use raw query methods or custom finders/behaviors without proper input sanitization and parameter binding.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ORM/Database Interaction Weaknesses -> Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ormdatabase_interaction_weaknesses_-_mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers modify model attributes they shouldn't have access to by manipulating request data. This is due to missing or incorrectly configured `_accessible` properties in CakePHP models, allowing unintended fields to be updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Templating Engine Vulnerabilities -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_templating_engine_vulnerabilities_-_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

Attackers inject malicious code into template files, which is then executed by the server during template rendering. This occurs when user-provided data is directly embedded into templates without proper escaping or sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Form Handling Weaknesses -> Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities (Form Context)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_form_handling_weaknesses_-_mass_assignment_vulnerabilities__form_context_.md)

Similar to ORM mass assignment, attackers leverage form submissions to modify model attributes that are not intended to be directly accessible through forms. This happens when form protection features are missing or misconfigured.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Form Handling Weaknesses -> Insecure Deserialization (If applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_form_handling_weaknesses_-_insecure_deserialization__if_applicable_.md)

Attackers inject malicious serialized objects that are then deserialized by the application, leading to arbitrary code execution. This can occur if session data or form data is handled using insecure deserialization practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Feature Weaknesses -> CSRF Token Bypass -> Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Tokens](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_feature_weaknesses_-_csrf_token_bypass_-_exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__to_stea_afb1639b.md)

Attackers first exploit an existing XSS vulnerability to steal valid CSRF tokens and then use these tokens to craft and submit forged requests, bypassing CSRF protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Feature Weaknesses -> Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_feature_weaknesses_-_authentication_bypass.md)

Attackers bypass the application's authentication mechanism to gain unauthorized access. This can be due to weaknesses in custom authentication logic, insecure session management, or flaws in "remember-me" functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Issues -> Expose Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_issues_-_expose_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

Attackers gain access to sensitive configuration files containing credentials, API keys, or other confidential information. This can occur due to default or weak file permissions or misconfigured web servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Components/Helpers/Behaviors -> Logic Flaws in Custom Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_componentshelpersbehaviors_-_logic_flaws_in_custom_code.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities present in custom-developed components, helpers, or behaviors. These vulnerabilities often stem from missing input validation or insecure data handling within the custom code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Components/Helpers/Behaviors -> Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_componentshelpersbehaviors_-_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the CakePHP application. This involves identifying outdated or vulnerable packages and leveraging their known exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Debug/Development Features (If Enabled in Production) -> Access Debug Kit Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_debugdevelopment_features__if_enabled_in_production__-_access_debug_kit_functionality.md)

Attackers access debugging tools like CakePHP's Debug Kit if they are mistakenly left enabled in a production environment. This provides access to sensitive information and potentially the ability to execute debugging commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Handling Issues -> Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_handling_issues_-_path_traversal.md)

Attackers manipulate file paths to access files and directories outside of the intended web root. This occurs due to a lack of proper input sanitization on file paths provided by users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Handling Issues -> Unrestricted File Upload](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_handling_issues_-_unrestricted_file_upload.md)

Attackers upload malicious files to the server due to a lack of proper validation on file uploads. These malicious files can then be executed, leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe Use of `query()` method](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe_use_of__query____method.md)

Directly leads to potential SQL injection and full database compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Finders/Behaviors](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_findersbehaviors.md)

Can lead to ORM injection and database compromise if custom code is vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsanitized User Input in Templates](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsanitized_user_input_in_templates.md)

Allows for Server-Side Template Injection and remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Helpers/View Cells](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_helpersview_cells.md)

Similar to unsanitized input, can lead to SSTI and remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsigned/Unencrypted Session Data (Insecure Deserialization)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsignedunencrypted_session_data__insecure_deserialization_.md)

Enables attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating session data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe Handling of Serialized Form Data (Insecure Deserialization)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe_handling_of_serialized_form_data__insecure_deserialization_.md)

Allows for code execution through manipulation of serialized form data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Custom Authentication Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_custom_authentication_logic.md)

Directly results in unauthorized access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Session Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_session_management.md)

Allows attackers to hijack user sessions and gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Debugging Commands](./attack_tree_paths/execute_debugging_commands.md)

Provides attackers with direct control over the application and server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Outdated/Vulnerable Packages](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_outdatedvulnerable_packages.md)

Allows attackers to leverage known exploits in third-party libraries for significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code via Uploaded Files](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_via_uploaded_files.md)

Grants attackers the ability to run arbitrary code on the server.
