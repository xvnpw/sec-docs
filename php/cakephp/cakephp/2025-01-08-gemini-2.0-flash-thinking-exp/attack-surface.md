# Attack Surface Analysis for cakephp/cakephp

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Controller Actions](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_controller_actions.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Unprotected Controller Actions**
    *   **Description:** Controller actions intended for internal use or administrative functions are accessible without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **How CakePHP Contributes:** CakePHP's routing system maps URLs to controller actions. If not explicitly configured with authentication and authorization middleware, actions are publicly accessible by default.
    *   **Example:** A controller action like `/admin/users/delete/5` is accessible to any unauthenticated user, allowing them to delete user accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication middleware to verify user identity.
        *   Implement authorization middleware (e.g., using CakePHP's Authorization component) to control access based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining access controls.
        *   Regularly review routing configurations and access control rules.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers can modify unintended model attributes by providing extra data in requests, potentially leading to data corruption or privilege escalation.
    *   **How CakePHP Contributes:** CakePHP's ORM allows for easy data population from request data (`$entity->patchEntity($this->request->getData())`). If not properly guarded, this can lead to unintended attribute updates.
    *   **Example:** A user registration form with an additional hidden field `is_admin=1` could be exploited to grant administrative privileges if the `is_admin` attribute is not protected in the User entity.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the `$_accessible` property in your entities to explicitly define which attributes can be mass-assigned.
        *   Whitelist specific fields allowed for mass assignment.
        *   Avoid directly passing `$this->request->getData()` without filtering to `patchEntity()`.
        *   Validate input data thoroughly before patching entities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection**
    *   **Description:**  Malicious scripts are injected into web pages through user-provided data that is not properly escaped when rendered in views.
    *   **How CakePHP Contributes:** While CakePHP's template engine offers auto-escaping by default, developers might inadvertently disable it or use functions that bypass escaping, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Displaying a user's comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` without proper escaping will execute the script in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure auto-escaping is enabled in your template engine configuration.
        *   Use the `h()` helper function for escaping output by default.
        *   Be extremely cautious when using the `|raw` filter or disabling escaping.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through ORM Bypass or Raw Queries](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_orm_bypass_or_raw_queries.md)

*   **Attack Surface: SQL Injection through ORM Bypass or Raw Queries**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **How CakePHP Contributes:** While CakePHP's ORM provides protection against SQL injection through parameter binding, developers might bypass the ORM for complex queries or use the `query()` method without proper sanitization.
    *   **Example:** Using `$connection->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_GET['username'] . "'")` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential for remote code execution depending on database permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Primarily rely on CakePHP's ORM with parameter binding for database interactions.
        *   Avoid direct SQL queries whenever possible.
        *   If using the `query()` method, always use prepared statements with proper parameterization.
        *   Implement input validation to restrict data types and formats.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Authentication and Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_authentication_and_session_management.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Authentication and Session Management**
    *   **Description:** Weaknesses in the authentication process or session handling can allow attackers to impersonate users or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How CakePHP Contributes:**  Developers might misconfigure CakePHP's authentication component, use weak password hashing algorithms, or have insecure session settings.
    *   **Example:** Using a simple MD5 hash for passwords or not setting the `HttpOnly` flag for session cookies.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
        *   Configure secure session settings (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure` flags, appropriate session timeout).
        *   Implement measures to prevent brute-force attacks on login forms (e.g., rate limiting, account lockout).
        *   Use HTTPS to protect session cookies from interception.

## Attack Surface: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Debug Mode Enabled in Production**
    *   **Description:** Leaving debug mode enabled in a production environment exposes sensitive information and can aid attackers in reconnaissance.
    *   **How CakePHP Contributes:** CakePHP's debug mode provides detailed error messages, internal paths, and potentially database credentials, which are invaluable for attackers.
    *   **Example:**  A user encountering an error in a production environment sees a stack trace revealing file paths and potentially sensitive configuration details.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, aiding attackers in identifying vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure debug mode is disabled in your production environment configuration (`'debug' => false`).
        *   Configure error logging to capture errors without displaying sensitive details to users.
