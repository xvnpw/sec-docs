# Threat Model Analysis for cakephp/cakephp

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

* **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability
    * **Description:** An attacker might craft malicious HTTP requests with extra form fields or request parameters that map to internal model properties not intended for external modification. By sending these requests, the attacker can directly manipulate database fields, potentially altering user roles, settings, or other sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation (e.g., promoting a regular user to an administrator), unauthorized modification of application settings, bypassing business logic.
    * **Affected Component:** ORM (Entity class, `_accessible` property, `patchEntity()`, `newEntity()`)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Explicitly define accessible fields in your entity classes using the `_accessible` property. Use `'fields' => [...]` to whitelist allowed fields for mass assignment.
        * Avoid using `true` for mass assignment accessibility unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        * Utilize form objects or Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to handle data submission and validation, ensuring only expected data is passed to entity creation or patching methods.
        * Sanitize and validate all user inputs before passing them to entity methods.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Templates](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_templates.md)

* **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Templates
    * **Description:** A developer might inadvertently include sensitive data directly in template variables without proper escaping or filtering. An attacker viewing the page source or intercepting the response can then access this information.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure of user credentials, API keys, internal application details, or other confidential information.
    * **Affected Component:** View Layer (Template files, View class, Helper classes)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always use CakePHP's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., the `h()` helper function) when displaying user-provided or potentially sensitive data in templates.
        * Be mindful of the data being passed to templates and avoid including sensitive information unnecessarily.
        * Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate certain types of data exfiltration.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Improper Implementation](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_improper_implementation.md)

* **Threat:** Authorization Bypass due to Improper Implementation
    * **Description:** An attacker might exploit flaws in the application's authorization logic to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized to. This could involve manipulating request parameters, exploiting logic errors in authorization checks, or bypassing front-end authorization measures.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, privilege escalation, execution of unauthorized actions.
    * **Affected Component:** Authorization Component, Controller actions, Middleware
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust authorization logic on the server-side using CakePHP's Authorization component or similar libraries.
        * Avoid relying solely on front-end checks for authorization.
        * Define clear and granular authorization rules based on user roles and permissions.
        * Thoroughly test authorization logic for various scenarios and edge cases.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Debug Mode in Production](./threats/information_disclosure_through_debug_mode_in_production.md)

* **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Debug Mode in Production
    * **Description:** If the CakePHP application is deployed with debug mode enabled (`'debug' => true` in `config/app.php`), attackers can access detailed error messages, stack traces, and potentially even database queries. This information can reveal valuable insights into the application's structure, vulnerabilities, and internal workings.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive configuration details, database schema, file paths, and potential vulnerabilities, aiding attackers in planning further attacks.
    * **Affected Component:** Error Handling, DebugKit (if installed)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the `'debug'` configuration value in `config/app.php` is set to `false` in production environments.
        * Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms that do not expose sensitive details to end-users.

## Threat: [Session Fixation Vulnerability](./threats/session_fixation_vulnerability.md)

* **Threat:** Session Fixation Vulnerability
    * **Description:** An attacker might be able to fix a user's session ID, allowing them to hijack the session after the user logs in. This can occur if the application does not regenerate the session ID after successful authentication.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionalities.
    * **Affected Component:** Authentication Component, Session Handling
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure that the application regenerates the session ID after successful login. CakePHP's Authentication component typically handles this by default.
        * Configure secure session settings, including using HTTP-only and secure flags for session cookies.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

* **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    * **Description:** Although less common in CakePHP due to its default escaping mechanisms, if developers use raw output or bypass the escaping mechanisms with user-controlled input, attackers might be able to inject malicious code into the template engine. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** View Layer (Template Engine), potentially Helper functions if they bypass escaping.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using raw output or bypassing the default escaping mechanisms unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        * Thoroughly sanitize any user input that influences template rendering logic.
        * Implement strict input validation to prevent the injection of template syntax.
