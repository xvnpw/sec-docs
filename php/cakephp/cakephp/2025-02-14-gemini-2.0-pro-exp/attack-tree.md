## Attack Tree Path: [[1] Bypassing ORM Security](./attack_tree_paths/_1__bypassing_orm_security.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application uses CakePHP's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with the database. This often involves bypassing the ORM's built-in protections against SQL injection.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Using `raw()` queries with unsanitized user input.
        *   Improperly constructing `conditions` arrays with user-supplied data, leading to unintended SQL queries.
        *   Failing to use CakePHP's built-in validation features when working with database input.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strictly adhere to CakePHP's ORM best practices.
        *   Avoid `raw()` queries whenever possible; use the ORM's query builder instead.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input before using it in any database interaction, even within the ORM.
        *   Use static analysis tools to detect unsafe ORM usage patterns.
        *   Regularly conduct code reviews focused on ORM security.

## Attack Tree Path: [[10] Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_tree_paths/_10__debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving CakePHP's debug mode enabled in a production environment. This exposes sensitive information, including database credentials, file paths, application logic, and stack traces, making the application extremely vulnerable.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be caught, but happens)
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Accessing the application in a browser and seeing detailed error messages, including file paths and database queries.
        *   Finding exposed configuration files or environment variables.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Absolutely ensure that debug mode is disabled in production.** Set `debug` to `false` in `config/app.php` (or the equivalent configuration file).
        *   Implement deployment checks to prevent accidental deployment with debug mode enabled.
        *   Regularly audit server configurations to confirm debug mode is off.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path: [Attacker's Goal] -> [Abuse CakePHP Features/Misconfigurations] -> [Routing/Dispatch] -> [5] Parameter Tampering (Weak Validation)](./attack_tree_paths/path__attacker's_goal__-__abuse_cakephp_featuresmisconfigurations__-__routingdispatch__-__5__paramet_fab783cc.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [[5] Parameter Tampering (Weak Validation)](./attack_tree_paths/_5__parameter_tampering__weak_validation_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting insufficient validation of parameters passed to controller actions through routes. This allows an attacker to manipulate the application's behavior by providing unexpected or malicious input.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the affected functionality)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Modifying a numeric ID in a URL to access data belonging to another user.
        *   Passing a string to a parameter that expects an integer, causing an error or unexpected behavior.
        *   Injecting special characters or code into parameters that are not properly sanitized.
        *   Submitting excessively large values to cause denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use CakePHP's built-in validation features (e.g., the `Validator` class) in controllers and models.
        *   Validate *all* input parameters, including those from routes, query strings, and request bodies.
        *   Define specific validation rules for each parameter (e.g., data type, length, format).
        *   Use whitelisting to allow only expected values.
        *   Implement input sanitization to remove or encode potentially harmful characters.
        *   Perform thorough input validation testing, including boundary cases and invalid input.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help detect and block malicious input.
