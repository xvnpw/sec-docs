# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust and flexible framework for PHP web application development.
*   Enable rapid development of secure and maintainable web applications.
*   Foster a large and active community of users and contributors.
*   Maintain a high level of code quality and stability.
*   Offer comprehensive documentation and support resources.
*   Stay current with the latest PHP versions and best practices.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to widespread exploitation of applications built with CakePHP.
*   Lack of maintenance or updates could lead to the framework becoming obsolete or incompatible with newer PHP versions.
*   A decline in community participation could hinder the framework's development and support.
*   Poor documentation or support could make it difficult for developers to use the framework effectively.
*   Competition from other PHP frameworks could reduce CakePHP's market share.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Built-in security components for handling common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, XSS, SQL injection). Described in CakePHP documentation and implemented in the framework's core components.
*   security control: ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to prevent SQL injection. Described in CakePHP documentation and implemented in the framework's database interaction layer.
*   security control: Input validation helpers and rules. Described in CakePHP documentation and implemented in the framework's form handling and data validation components.
*   security control: Authentication and authorization components. Described in CakePHP documentation and implemented in the framework's security and access control components.
*   security control: Security utilities for tasks like password hashing and encryption. Described in CakePHP documentation and implemented in the framework's security utilities.
*   security control: Regular security audits and updates. Implemented through the CakePHP core team's development process.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries and plugins, which may have their own security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration or improper use of security features by developers using the framework.
*   accepted risk: Zero-day vulnerabilities that may not be immediately addressed.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
*   security control: Integrate with static application security testing (SAST) tools for continuous code analysis.
*   security control: Provide more detailed guidance and tooling for secure deployment and configuration.
*   security control: Establish a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to report vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for various authentication methods (e.g., username/password, OAuth, API keys).
    *   Secure password storage using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
    *   Session management with secure cookies (HTTP-only, secure flag).
*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    *   Fine-grained control over access to resources and actions.
    *   Protection against privilege escalation attacks.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user input to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).
    *   Whitelist-based validation whenever possible.
    *   Proper encoding and escaping of output to prevent XSS.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for encryption and hashing.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection of sensitive data in transit and at rest.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"]
    Git["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    CI_Server["CI Server (e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    Artifacts["Build Artifacts (Composer Packages)"]
    Composer["Composer"]

    Developer -- "Pushes code" --> Git
    Git -- "Triggers build" --> CI_Server
    CI_Server -- "Runs tests, SAST" --> Composer
    Composer -- "Creates" --> Artifacts
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: Developers write code and push changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  Git Repository: The Git repository stores the application's source code and triggers the build process upon code changes.
3.  CI Server: A continuous integration (CI) server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by changes in the Git repository.
4.  Build Steps:
    *   Checkout Code: The CI server checks out the latest code from the repository.
    *   Dependency Management: Composer is used to install project dependencies.
    *   Static Analysis: Static application security testing (SAST) tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) are run to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
    *   Unit Tests: Unit tests are executed to verify the functionality of individual components.
    *   Integration Tests: Integration tests are run to ensure that different parts of the application work together correctly.
    *   Build Artifacts: If all tests and checks pass, build artifacts (e.g., Composer packages) are created.
5.  Artifact Storage: The build artifacts are stored in a package repository or artifact storage.

Security Controls:

*   security control: SAST tools are integrated into the build process to identify security vulnerabilities early.
*   security control: Dependency scanning tools are used to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Automated tests (unit, integration) are run to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Code reviews are performed to identify potential security issues and ensure adherence to coding standards.
*   security control: The CI/CD pipeline is secured to prevent unauthorized access and modification.
*   security control: Supply chain security measures are implemented to verify the integrity of dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   User registration and authentication.
*   Data management (CRUD operations).
*   Application-specific business logic (e.g., e-commerce transactions, content management).
*   Communication with external services (e.g., email, third-party APIs).

Data Sensitivity:

*   User data (e.g., usernames, passwords, email addresses, personal information): High sensitivity.
*   Application data (e.g., content, transactions, financial data): Varies depending on the specific application, but potentially high sensitivity.
*   Configuration data (e.g., database credentials, API keys): High sensitivity.
*   Logs: Medium sensitivity (may contain sensitive information).
