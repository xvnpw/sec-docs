# Attack Surface Analysis for cakephp/cakephp

## Attack Surface: [1. Route Misconfiguration and Exposure](./attack_surfaces/1__route_misconfiguration_and_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly defined routes expose internal controllers, actions, or parameters, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **CakePHP Contribution:** CakePHP's routing system, while powerful, can be misconfigured to expose unintended functionality.  Overly permissive routes or lack of access control within controllers are *direct* CakePHP issues.
*   **Example:** A route defined as `/:controller/:action/*` without proper controller-level checks allows an attacker to access `/users/delete/1`.  An administrative route `/admin/debug_info` is accessible without authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, modification of data, execution of unintended actions, potential full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Define specific, restrictive routes.  Avoid wildcard routes. Use route prefixes (e.g., `prefix('admin')`) and middleware for authentication/authorization.  Disable debug mode in production. Thoroughly review and test all routes.

## Attack Surface: [2. Parameter Tampering (Bypassing CakePHP Protections)](./attack_surfaces/2__parameter_tampering__bypassing_cakephp_protections_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate request parameters to bypass CakePHP's sanitization and validation.
*   **CakePHP Contribution:** Developers *directly* bypassing CakePHP's request handling methods (`$this->request->getData()`, etc.) or misusing the data negates the framework's protections. This is a *direct* misuse of the framework.
*   **Example:** A developer directly accesses `$_POST['user_id']` instead of `$this->request->getData('user_id')`.
*   **Impact:** SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), privilege escalation, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** *Always* use CakePHP's request object methods. *Never* directly access PHP superglobals. Implement robust server-side validation using CakePHP's features. Use strict type checking.

## Attack Surface: [3. Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify fields they shouldn't have access to during data creation/updates.
*   **CakePHP Contribution:** CakePHP's ORM uses mass assignment, requiring explicit configuration (`$_accessible` property) to prevent this.  Misconfiguration is a *direct* CakePHP issue.
*   **Example:** An entity's `$_accessible` property is set to `['*' => true]`, allowing modification of the `role` field.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Explicitly define the `$_accessible` property in each entity. Avoid `'*' => true`. Use the `fields` option in `newEntity()` and `patchEntity()`.

## Attack Surface: [4. Bypassing ORM Protections (SQL Injection)](./attack_surfaces/4__bypassing_orm_protections__sql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code by bypassing CakePHP's ORM.
*   **CakePHP Contribution:** Developers *directly* circumventing the ORM's protections by using raw SQL queries or improperly handling user input within ORM functions is a *direct* misuse of the framework.
*   **Example:** Using `$this->Model->query()` with unsanitized user input.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification/deletion, potential full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** *Always* use the ORM's methods. If `query()` is unavoidable, *always* use prepared statements with bound parameters. *Never* concatenate user input into SQL.

## Attack Surface: [5. Authentication and Authorization Bypass (CakePHP Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/5__authentication_and_authorization_bypass__cakephp_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access due to *misconfigured* CakePHP authentication or insufficient authorization *within CakePHP's mechanisms*.
*   **CakePHP Contribution:**  This focuses on *direct* misconfiguration of CakePHP's authentication/authorization components or middleware, *not* general lack of authorization.
*   **Example:**  The authentication component is configured with a weak password hashing algorithm *within CakePHP's configuration*. Authorization checks are missing *within a controller action using CakePHP's authorization component*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use strong password hashing (bcrypt) *within CakePHP's authentication configuration*. Implement authorization checks in *every* controller action requiring access control, *using CakePHP's authorization component or middleware*. Properly handle session management *using CakePHP's features*.
