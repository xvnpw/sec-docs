## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Intervention Image (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_intervention_image__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal. Successful exploitation of any of the sub-nodes can lead to this. Mitigation focuses on preventing any of the attack paths below.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Loading Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_loading_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Image File (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_image_file__high-risk_path_start_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerability in Supported Format Parser (e.g., libjpeg, libpng, GIFLIB) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerability_in_supported_format_parser__e_g___libjpeg__libpng__giflib___critical_nod_9c313328.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in JPEG parsing (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_jpeg_parsing__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Crafting a specially malformed JPEG image that, when parsed by the underlying libjpeg library, causes a buffer overflow. This allows the attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow in PNG decoding (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflow_in_png_decoding__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Crafting a malicious PNG image that exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the libpng library during the decoding process. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Intervention Image's File Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_intervention_image's_file_handling.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal during file loading (e.g., using "../" in filename) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_during_file_loading__e_g___using____in_filename___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Providing a manipulated filename (e.g., "../../config/database.php") to Intervention Image's loading functions. If not properly sanitized, this allows the attacker to access files outside the intended directory, potentially reading sensitive configuration files or application code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Image URL](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_image_url.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) leading to internal resource access (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__leading_to_internal_resource_access__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Providing a malicious URL (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd` or an internal service endpoint) to Intervention Image's URL loading functionality. If not properly validated, the server will make a request to the attacker-specified URL, potentially exposing internal files or allowing interaction with internal services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerable Processing Function with Malicious Input (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerable_processing_function_with_malicious_input__high-risk_path_start_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Image Manipulation Functions (e.g., resize, crop, rotate)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_image_manipulation_functions__e_g___resize__crop__rotate_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Integer overflows leading to buffer overflows during resizing or cropping operations. (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflows_leading_to_buffer_overflows_during_resizing_or_cropping_operations___high-risk_pat_7042ec11.md)

Attack Vector: Providing specific parameters (e.g., very large dimensions) to image manipulation functions like `resize` or `crop`. This can trigger integer overflows in the underlying image processing libraries (like GD or Imagick), leading to buffer overflows and potential code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Saving Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_saving_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Control Output Path or Filename (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/control_output_path_or_filename__high-risk_path_start_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal during file saving, overwriting critical files. (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_during_file_saving__overwriting_critical_files___high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Providing a manipulated output path (e.g., "../../config/config.php") to Intervention Image's saving functions. If not properly sanitized, this allows the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting configuration files, application code, or other critical system files.
