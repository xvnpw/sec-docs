# Threat Model Analysis for intervention/image

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Image File Upload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_image_file_upload.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads an excessively large image file. The `Intervention\Image\ImageManager` or specific driver implementations (GD, Imagick) within Intervention Image attempt to load and process this file, consuming significant server resources (CPU, memory) and potentially leading to application slowdown or crash. The attacker might automate this process with multiple requests targeting the image processing endpoints.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability for legitimate users. Server resources are exhausted, potentially affecting other applications on the same server.

**Affected Component:** `Intervention\Image\ImageManager` and underlying driver implementations (GD, Imagick) during image loading (`make()` method or similar).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement file size limits on image uploads *before* passing the file to Intervention Image.
* Configure timeouts for image processing operations within the application logic using Intervention Image.
* Use asynchronous processing or a queue system for image handling to prevent blocking the main application thread.
* Monitor server resource usage and implement alerts for unusual spikes related to image processing.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via "Zip Bomb" or Decompression Bomb](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_zip_bomb_or_decompression_bomb.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a seemingly small image file that, upon decompression by the underlying libraries used by Intervention Image (like GD or Imagick), expands to an enormous size. When Intervention Image attempts to process this decompressed data, it consumes excessive memory and CPU, leading to a DoS. The vulnerability lies in how Intervention Image triggers the decompression process.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to memory exhaustion. Server resources are overwhelmed, potentially affecting other applications.

**Affected Component:** Image Decoding within the underlying drivers (GD, Imagick) as triggered by `Intervention\Image\ImageManager` or specific driver methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement checks on the decompressed size of the image data *after* loading with Intervention Image, but before further processing.
* Consider using libraries or methods that provide more control over the decompression process and allow setting limits.
* Analyze file headers before full loading with Intervention Image to identify potentially malicious compressed files.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Image Loading](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_image_loading.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Intervention Image's functionality to load images from URLs (`make()` method with a URL), an attacker can supply a malicious internal URL. When Intervention Image attempts to load this URL, it makes a request from the server, potentially accessing internal services or resources that are not publicly accessible. This directly leverages Intervention Image's capability to fetch remote resources.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, ability to perform actions on internal systems on behalf of the server.

**Affected Component:** `Intervention\Image\ImageManager` and underlying driver implementations when loading images from URLs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a strict whitelist of allowed URL schemes and domains for image loading *before* passing the URL to Intervention Image.
* Avoid directly using user-provided URLs for image loading. Instead, download the image to the server first using a safe method and then process the local file with Intervention Image.
* If direct URL loading is absolutely necessary, use a separate, isolated network or virtual machine for image processing.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during Image Loading](./threats/path_traversal_during_image_loading.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify file paths for image loading that are then directly passed to Intervention Image's `make()` method or similar, an attacker might be able to use path traversal techniques (e.g., "../../../sensitive_file.jpg") to trick Intervention Image into loading files outside the intended directory. This vulnerability arises from the application's insecure use of Intervention Image's file loading capabilities.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the server, potential data breaches.

**Affected Component:** `Intervention\Image\ImageManager` and underlying driver implementations when loading images from local file paths, specifically how the application uses these features.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never allow users to directly specify file paths for image loading that are passed directly to Intervention Image.
* Use secure file handling practices and validate any provided file paths against a whitelist of allowed directories *before* using them with Intervention Image.
* Use unique identifiers or database lookups to map user input to actual file paths, preventing direct file path manipulation.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during Image Saving](./threats/path_traversal_during_image_saving.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify the output file path for saving processed images using Intervention Image's `save()` method, an attacker could use path traversal techniques to write files to arbitrary locations on the server. This is a direct consequence of how the application utilizes Intervention Image's file saving functionality.

**Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, potential for code execution if writing to web-accessible directories.

**Affected Component:** `Intervention\Image\Image` object's `save()` method and underlying driver implementations for file saving.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never allow users to directly specify output file paths for the `save()` method.
* Use secure file handling practices and generate unique and predictable file names programmatically.
* Store processed images in designated secure directories with restricted access, and construct the full save path within the application logic.
