# Threat Model Analysis for intervention/image

## Threat: [Image Bomb / Resource Exhaustion](./threats/image_bomb__resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Image Bomb / Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted image (e.g., highly compressed, extremely large dimensions, or a "zip bomb" disguised as an image) designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) during processing *by the image processing libraries*. The attacker aims to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the application unavailable. The core issue is the image *content* itself causing the problem.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service; application becomes unresponsive; potential server crash; financial losses due to downtime.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core image processing functions within Intervention/Image that interact with underlying libraries (ImageMagick or GD): `Image::make()`, `resize()`, `crop()`, and encoding functions like `encode()`, `save()`. The underlying libraries (ImageMagick or GD) are the direct targets of the malicious image data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Enforce maximum file size limits (e.g., 2MB), maximum image dimensions (e.g., 4096x4096), and validate the image type *before* processing (using more than just the file extension â€“ use MIME type detection and potentially magic number checks). This is crucial to prevent obviously oversized or malformed images from even reaching the processing stage.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set PHP's `memory_limit` and `max_execution_time` to reasonable values. This limits the damage a single image can do.
        *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use a queue system (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) to process images asynchronously. This prevents a single malicious upload from blocking the main web server.
        *   **Timeout Handling:** Implement timeouts for image processing. If an operation takes too long, terminate it.
        *   **Image Re-encoding:** Re-encode all uploaded images to a standard format and quality (e.g., JPEG with 80% quality). This can normalize images and mitigate some decompression bomb attacks.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit image uploads per user/IP address.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can sometimes detect and block known image bomb patterns.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Image Processing Library Vulnerability](./threats/code_injection_via_image_processing_library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection via Image Processing Library Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the underlying image processing libraries (ImageMagick or GD) *through a specially crafted image*. The attacker uploads this image, designed to trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. The vulnerability is triggered by the *image data* itself.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE); complete server compromise; data theft; data modification; installation of malware.
    *   **Affected Component:** The underlying image processing libraries (ImageMagick or GD) that Intervention/Image uses. Intervention/Image is the conduit, but the vulnerability lies in the libraries' handling of the malicious *image content*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Software Updated:** *Crucially*, regularly update Intervention/Image, ImageMagick, GD, and all system libraries. This is the primary defense against known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the web server and image processing with the least privileges necessary.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker) to isolate image processing.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF might detect and block some exploit attempts.
        *   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** Strict input validation (as in the "Image Bomb" threat) can reduce the attack surface, though it's not a complete solution. This helps prevent obviously malformed images from reaching the vulnerable code.

## Threat: [Metadata Exploitation / Information Disclosure (Focus on *malicious injection*)](./threats/metadata_exploitation__information_disclosure__focus_on_malicious_injection_.md)

*   **Threat:** Metadata Exploitation / Information Disclosure (Focus on *malicious injection*)
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads an image and attempts to *inject* malicious metadata (EXIF, XMP) to mislead the application or other users. This differs from simple leakage; the attacker is actively trying to *modify* or *add* harmful metadata.  This is a *high* risk because the attacker is actively manipulating the image data.
    *   **Impact:**  Misleading application behavior; potential for social engineering if metadata is displayed to users; potential for vulnerabilities if the application uses the metadata in insecure ways (e.g., displaying it without sanitization).
    *   **Affected Component:** Intervention/Image's metadata handling functions (`exif()`, and any code that reads or writes image metadata). The attacker is targeting how the application *interprets* the image's metadata.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Metadata Stripping:** Remove *all* metadata by default. This is the safest approach. Use `$image->destroy()` after processing.
        *   **Whitelist Approach:** If specific metadata is needed, use a strict whitelist and *only* retain those fields.
        *   **Sanitization:** If retaining any metadata, *thoroughly* sanitize it to remove any potentially harmful characters or values before using or displaying it.
