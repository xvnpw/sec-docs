## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve RCE [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_rce__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary objective of the attacker. Remote Code Execution allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, effectively gaining full control.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete system compromise.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** All mitigations related to preventing RCE are critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit ImageMagick/GD Vuln. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_imagemagickgd_vuln___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents exploiting known vulnerabilities in the underlying image processing libraries, ImageMagick or GD. These libraries are often targeted due to their complexity and widespread use.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Leads directly to RCE.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   Keep ImageMagick and GD updated to the latest versions.
    *   Use a vulnerability scanner to identify outdated components.
    *   Configure ImageMagick's `policy.xml` to restrict resources and disable dangerous features.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 ImageTragick Exploit [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_imagetragick_exploit__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** A specific set of vulnerabilities in ImageMagick (e.g., CVE-2016-3714) that allow RCE through specially crafted image files. These vulnerabilities are well-known and have publicly available exploits.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Direct RCE.
*   **Likelihood (if unpatched):** High.
*   **Effort:** Very Low - Public exploits are readily available.
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Signature-based detection is possible.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure ImageMagick is updated to a version that patches ImageTragick vulnerabilities.
    *   Use a WAF with rules to detect and block ImageTragick exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [-> HIGH RISK -> 1.1.2 Image Shell Command Injection [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/-_high_risk_-_1_1_2_image_shell_command_injection__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack occurs when the application passes unsanitized user-supplied data (e.g., filenames, image parameters) to ImageMagick or GD functions. The attacker can inject shell commands into these parameters, which are then executed by the server.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Direct RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the application's input handling.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires crafting malicious input.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by IDS/SIEM, but sophisticated attackers might try to evade detection.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize *all* user-supplied data before passing it to ImageMagick/GD functions.  Use a well-vetted sanitization library and a whitelist approach where possible.  Do *not* rely on blacklisting.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the web server and image processing processes run with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate the *type* and *content* of user input, not just the format.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit Intervention/Image Logic Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_interventionimage_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** This represents vulnerabilities within the Intervention/Image library's code itself, rather than in its dependencies.
*   **Impact:** High - Could lead to RCE or other significant compromises.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**
    *   Regular security audits of the Intervention/Image library.
    *   Keep the library updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Unsafe File Handling](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_unsafe_file_handling.md)

*   **Description:** If the library doesn't properly sanitize filenames or paths, an attacker might be able to write files to arbitrary locations.
*   **Impact:** High.
*   **Likelihood:** Low.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Sanitize filenames and paths.
    *   Use a well-vetted sanitization library.

## Attack Tree Path: [-> HIGH RISK -> 1.2.2 Image Type Change [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/-_high_risk_-_1_2_2_image_type_change__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack exploits a common application-level vulnerability: insufficient image type verification. The attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script) disguised as an image (e.g., with a `.jpg` extension). If the application relies solely on the file extension and doesn't verify the actual content, the server might execute the malicious script.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Direct RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the application's image type handling.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires crafting a malicious file and bypassing extension checks.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by file integrity monitoring and web application firewalls.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Content-Based Type Verification:**  *Never* rely solely on the file extension to determine the file type.  Use Intervention/Image's `mime()` method (which uses `finfo_buffer` or `mime_content_type` internally) or a similar robust method to determine the *actual* content type based on the file's contents, *not* its extension.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Types:**  Maintain a whitelist of allowed image MIME types (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`) and reject any files that don't match.
    *   **Store Uploaded Files Outside the Web Root:**  Store uploaded files in a directory that is *not* directly accessible via the web server.  Serve the images through a script that performs additional checks.
    *   **Rename Uploaded Files:**  Rename uploaded files to randomly generated names to prevent attackers from guessing the file path and directly accessing the uploaded file.
