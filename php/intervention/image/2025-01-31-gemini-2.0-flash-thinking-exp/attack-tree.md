Directly targeting known vulnerabilities in GD or Imagick is a high-risk path to compromise.
    * High-risk due to the potential for critical impact and the relative ease of exploitation if known vulnerabilities exist.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Identify Outdated GD/Imagick Version in Application Environment (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/10__identify_outdated_gdimagick_version_in_application_environment__high-risk_path_.md)

Identifying outdated versions is a crucial step for attackers targeting known CVEs.
    * High-risk because outdated libraries are common and easily targeted if version information is accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Application Misconfiguration (Related to Image Handling) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/11__application_misconfiguration__related_to_image_handling___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

Misconfigurations in the application using Intervention Image can create vulnerabilities even if the library itself is secure.
    * High-risk because misconfigurations are common and can lead to various security issues, including RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Insecure File Storage/Permissions (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/12__insecure_file_storagepermissions__high-risk_path_.md)

Improperly configured file storage can allow attackers to upload and potentially execute malicious files.
    * High-risk due to the potential for direct file access and execution if storage is publicly accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Upload Malicious Image to Publicly Accessible Directory (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/13__upload_malicious_image_to_publicly_accessible_directory__high-risk_path_.md)

Uploading malicious images to publicly accessible directories is a direct path to potential compromise if the web server is misconfigured to execute files from these directories.
    * High-risk due to the ease of exploitation and potential for immediate impact if misconfiguration exists.

## Attack Tree Path: [14. Insufficient Input Validation (Before Image Processing) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/14__insufficient_input_validation__before_image_processing___high-risk_path_.md)

Lack of proper input validation allows attackers to bypass security checks and upload malicious files or trigger unexpected behavior.
    * High-risk because weak input validation is a common vulnerability and can enable various attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [15. Bypass File Type/Size Checks to Upload Malicious Image (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/15__bypass_file_typesize_checks_to_upload_malicious_image__high-risk_path_.md)

Bypassing file type and size checks allows attackers to upload files that would otherwise be blocked, potentially including malicious images.
    * High-risk because it's a common weakness in input validation and allows for the delivery of malicious payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [16. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/16__cause_denial_of_service__dos___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

DoS attacks aim to make the application unavailable, causing disruption and potential financial loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [20. Bypass Size Limits (Application or Web Server) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/20__bypass_size_limits__application_or_web_server___high-risk_path_.md)

Bypassing size limits allows attackers to upload extremely large images, facilitating memory exhaustion DoS attacks.
    * High-risk because it enables the "Upload Extremely Large Image" attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [21. Concurrent Image Processing Requests (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/21__concurrent_image_processing_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

Flooding the server with many simultaneous image processing requests can overwhelm resources and cause DoS.
    * High-risk due to the ease of execution and potential for significant impact, especially if rate limiting is absent.

## Attack Tree Path: [22. Send Many Requests to Process Images Simultaneously (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/22__send_many_requests_to_process_images_simultaneously__high-risk_path_.md)

This is the direct action of a concurrent request DoS attack.
