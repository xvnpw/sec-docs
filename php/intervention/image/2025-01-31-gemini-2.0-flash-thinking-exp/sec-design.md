# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, benefiting from GitHub's security features (e.g., vulnerability scanning, dependency graph). Implemented by: GitHub platform.
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented by: Open-source community.
  - security control: Use of PHP, which has its own set of security best practices and common vulnerabilities. Implemented by: PHP runtime environment and developer practices.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities might be discovered and publicly disclosed before a patch is available due to the open-source nature.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes can lead to delays in addressing vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for insecure coding practices by contributors if security guidelines are not strictly enforced.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Implement Dependency Scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the project.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to provide a channel for security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Integrate security testing (unit and integration tests focusing on security aspects) into the development process.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Applications using this library are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Applications using this library are responsible for their own authorization mechanisms to control access to images and image processing functionalities.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library must perform robust input validation on all image data and parameters to prevent vulnerabilities such as image bombs, buffer overflows, and format string bugs.
    - Requirement: Validate image file headers and metadata to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious data.
    - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided parameters used in image manipulation operations to prevent injection attacks.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If the library handles sensitive image data or supports encrypted image formats, ensure proper and secure cryptographic implementations are used.
    - Requirement: Avoid storing cryptographic keys or secrets within the library code. Applications using the library should manage their own keys securely if needed.
