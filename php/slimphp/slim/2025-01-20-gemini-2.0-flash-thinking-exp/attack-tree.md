## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the Slim Framework application defines and handles routes. Attackers aim to manipulate routing mechanisms to gain unauthorized access or trigger unintended behavior.

    *   **Critical Node: Bypass Authentication/Authorization via Route Manipulation**
        *   Attackers attempt to circumvent authentication or authorization checks by crafting specific URLs or manipulating route parameters. The goal is to access resources or functionalities that should be restricted.

            *   **Critical Node: Route Parameter Injection**
                *   Attackers manipulate route parameters (values within the URL path) to access restricted resources or functionalities. For example, in a route like `/users/{id}`, an attacker might try `/users/admin` if the application doesn't properly validate the `id` parameter, potentially gaining access to administrative user data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities within the middleware layer of the Slim Framework application. Middleware functions process requests before they reach the route handler, and weaknesses here can lead to significant security breaches.

    *   **Critical Node: Bypass Security Middleware**
        *   Attackers attempt to circumvent security checks implemented in custom middleware. This could involve exploiting flaws in the middleware's logic or finding ways to bypass its execution entirely.

            *   **Critical Node: Exploit vulnerabilities in custom middleware logic.**
                *   Attackers identify and exploit flaws in the code of custom-built middleware. This could involve logic errors, improper handling of input, or vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication, authorization, or other security measures implemented within the middleware.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Dependency Injection Container Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dependency_injection_container_weaknesses.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the Slim Framework's dependency injection (DI) container. The DI container manages application services, and weaknesses here can lead to significant compromise.

    *   **Critical Node: Overwrite Service Definitions**
        *   Attackers attempt to replace legitimate service definitions within the DI container with malicious implementations. This allows them to inject malicious code that will be executed when the compromised service is used by the application.

    *   **Critical Node: Access Sensitive Services**
        *   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the DI container's access control or visibility to gain access to services that contain sensitive information or functionalities. This could involve accessing database connections, API clients with privileged access, or other critical components.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Request/Response Object Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_requestresponse_object_handling.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities arising from how the Slim Framework application handles incoming requests and constructs outgoing responses. Improper handling of request data can lead to various injection attacks.

    *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Data via Request Objects**
        *   Attackers exploit insufficient input validation or sanitization when the application accesses data from the request object (e.g., query parameters, request body). This allows them to inject malicious data that can be interpreted as code or commands.

            *   **Critical Node: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
                *   Attackers inject malicious URLs into request parameters that are then used by the server to make outbound requests. This can allow them to access internal resources, interact with other systems on the internal network, or even perform actions on behalf of the server.

            *   **Critical Node: Command Injection**
                *   Attackers inject malicious commands into request parameters that are subsequently used in system calls or executed by the server's operating system. This can lead to complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities related to the application's configuration, which, while not strictly a Slim vulnerability, is crucial for the application's security.

    *   **Critical Node: Access Sensitive Configuration Data**
        *   Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to configuration files or environment variables that contain sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or other secrets. Access to this data can lead to a complete compromise of the application and its associated resources.
