# Threat Model Analysis for slimphp/slim

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters in the URL to inject unexpected values. This could involve injecting SQL code, OS commands, or other malicious payloads if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate these parameters before using them in database queries, system calls, or other sensitive operations. This vulnerability arises from how Slim extracts and makes these parameters available to the application.

**Impact:** Depending on the injection, this could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion (SQL Injection), remote code execution (OS Command Injection), or other unintended application behavior.

**Affected Component:** Route matching logic, specifically how route parameters are extracted and made available within route handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all route parameters within your application's route handlers.
* Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
* Avoid directly using route parameters in system calls or other potentially dangerous operations.
* Employ input validation libraries or framework features to enforce expected data types and formats.

## Threat: [Dependency Injection Vulnerability (Misconfigured Container)](./threats/dependency_injection_vulnerability__misconfigured_container_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration in the Slim's dependency injection container. This could involve injecting malicious dependencies or manipulating service definitions if the container is not properly secured or if custom factories have vulnerabilities. This is a direct vulnerability within Slim's dependency management system.

**Impact:** Potentially leading to remote code execution if a malicious dependency is injected and executed, or unauthorized access to sensitive data if a compromised service is used.

**Affected Component:** Dependency Injection Container.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure the dependency injection container and restrict access to its configuration.
* Thoroughly review and test all custom factories and providers used to create services.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly within the container if possible.
* Ensure that dependencies are instantiated securely and follow the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Outdated Slim Framework Version](./threats/outdated_slim_framework_version.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities present in an outdated version of the Slim framework. These vulnerabilities are inherent to the framework's code and might have been patched in newer releases.

**Impact:** Exposure to various security risks depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or other forms of compromise.

**Affected Component:** Core Slim framework code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Slim framework updated to the latest stable version.
* Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly.
* Monitor security advisories related to the Slim framework.
