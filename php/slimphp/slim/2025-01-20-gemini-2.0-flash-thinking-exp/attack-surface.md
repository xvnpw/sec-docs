# Attack Surface Analysis for slimphp/slim

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious data into route parameters, which, if not properly sanitized, can lead to vulnerabilities when used within the application logic.
    *   **How Slim Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Slim's routing mechanism directly exposes route parameters to the application. If developers don't sanitize these parameters before using them in database queries, file operations, or other sensitive contexts, it creates an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A route defined as `/users/{id}`. An attacker could send a request like `/users/1 UNION SELECT password FROM users WHERE id = 2` if the `id` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on how the unsanitized parameter is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Always validate route parameters against expected types and formats.
        *   **Parameterized Queries/ORMs:** Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Encode data before displaying it to prevent XSS if the parameter is reflected in the response.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application has only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly configured or implemented middleware can be bypassed, allowing requests to reach application logic without undergoing intended security checks.
    *   **How Slim Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Slim's middleware system relies on the order in which middleware is added. Incorrect ordering or flaws in custom middleware can create opportunities for bypass.
    *   **Example:** Authentication middleware is added *after* a middleware that handles file uploads. An attacker could upload malicious files without being authenticated.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, circumvention of security controls, exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Middleware Ordering:** Ensure middleware is added in the correct order, with security-critical middleware executed early in the request lifecycle.
        *   **Thorough Testing of Middleware:**  Test custom middleware rigorously for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Avoid Complex Logic in Middleware:** Keep middleware focused on specific tasks to reduce the chance of errors.
        *   **Regularly Review Middleware Configuration:** Ensure the middleware configuration remains secure as the application evolves.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on Request Body/Query Parameters](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_request_bodyquery_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**  Failure to validate and sanitize data received in the request body or query parameters can lead to various injection attacks.
    *   **How Slim Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Slim provides easy access to request data through methods like `$request->getParsedBody()` and `$request->getQueryParams()`. If developers don't implement validation on this data, it becomes a direct attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a POST request with malicious JavaScript in a form field, which is then stored in the database and later displayed without encoding, leading to XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Command Injection, and other injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation Libraries:** Utilize validation libraries to define and enforce data constraints.
        *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS attacks.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the application's access to resources based on validated input.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection (If Using Templating)](./attack_surfaces/template_injection__if_using_templating_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses a templating engine and allows user-controlled data to be directly embedded into templates without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious code.
    *   **How Slim Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While Slim itself doesn't enforce a specific templating engine, its flexibility allows integration with various templating systems. If developers use these systems insecurely, it introduces this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Using Twig, an attacker could inject `{{ _self.env.getRuntimeLoader().getSourceContext('index.twig').getCode() }}` to read the template source code or potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Auto-escaping:** Ensure the templating engine's auto-escaping feature is enabled for user-supplied data.
        *   **Avoid Raw Output:**  Minimize the use of raw output or unescaped variables in templates.
        *   **Secure Templating Practices:** Follow the security guidelines provided by the specific templating engine being used.
        *   **Sandboxing (If Available):** Utilize sandboxing features provided by the templating engine to restrict code execution.
