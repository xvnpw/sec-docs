# Threat Model Analysis for slimphp/slim

## Threat: [Dependency Hijacking (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/dependency_hijacking__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a package that Slim itself depends on (e.g., a PSR-7 implementation). The attacker injects malicious code into the dependency. When Slim or an application using Slim updates its dependencies, the malicious code is executed. This is a direct threat because Slim's functionality relies on these external dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data exfiltration, complete system compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Slim Component:**  Indirectly affects the entire application, as any part of Slim could use the compromised dependency.  Specifically impacts the `composer` dependency management system and any Slim code that utilizes the compromised dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (`composer audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) and address reported vulnerabilities promptly.
        *   Regularly update dependencies (`composer update`).
        *   Carefully vet new dependencies before adding them (though this is less directly applicable to *Slim's* dependencies, as those are largely fixed).
        *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.
        *   Pin dependencies to specific versions (using `composer.lock`) *after* thorough testing, but be aware this can prevent security updates. A balance is needed. This is more applicable to application-level dependencies than Slim's core dependencies.
        *   Use a private package repository (e.g., Private Packagist, Artifactory) to control the source of dependencies (again, more applicable to application dependencies).

## Threat: [Middleware Ordering Bypass](./threats/middleware_ordering_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that exploits an incorrect middleware ordering *within Slim's middleware pipeline*.  If authentication middleware is placed *after* authorization middleware, the attacker can bypass authorization. This is a direct Slim issue because the framework provides the middleware mechanism and its ordering is crucial for security.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, data breaches, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Affected Slim Component:** The `App` object's middleware pipeline (`->add()`, `->addMiddleware()`). The specific impact depends on the misconfigured middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully plan and document the middleware execution order. Understand the dependencies between middleware components.
        *   Thoroughly test the middleware pipeline with various request types to ensure the correct order is enforced.
        *   Use automated tests to verify that security-critical middleware executes *before* any middleware that depends on it.
        *   Consider using a visual tool or diagram to represent the middleware pipeline.

## Threat: [Third-Party Middleware Vulnerability (Specifically in Slim Middleware)](./threats/third-party_middleware_vulnerability__specifically_in_slim_middleware_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a *third-party Slim middleware* package used by the application. This is distinct from a general dependency issue because it's specific to middleware that integrates directly with Slim's request/response cycle.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the middleware, potentially RCE, data leakage, DoS.
    *   **Affected Slim Component:** The specific third-party middleware component (implementation of `MiddlewareInterface`) that integrates with Slim's pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet third-party *Slim* middleware before using it. Research its security history and reputation.
        *   Regularly update third-party *Slim* middleware to the latest versions.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to the *Slim* middleware used.
        *   Consider contributing to the security of the middleware by reporting vulnerabilities or submitting patches.

## Threat: [Information Leakage via Default Error Handling (in Production)](./threats/information_leakage_via_default_error_handling__in_production_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers an error, and Slim's *default development error handler* is accidentally left enabled in a *production* environment. This handler reveals sensitive information (file paths, stack traces) that aids the attacker. This is a direct Slim issue because it's the framework's default behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, which can be used to facilitate other attacks.
    *   **Affected Slim Component:** `Slim\Error\Renderers\HtmlErrorRenderer` (default in development), `Slim\App::handleError`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** use the default development error handler in a production environment.
        *   Implement a custom error handler that displays generic error messages to users and logs detailed error information securely.
        *   Configure Slim to use a production-ready error handler (e.g., `ErrorHandler` with appropriate settings, or a custom implementation).

## Threat: [Unprotected Internal Routes (Due to Misconfiguration of Slim's Routing)](./threats/unprotected_internal_routes__due_to_misconfiguration_of_slim's_routing_.md)

*   **Description:** Routes intended for internal use are exposed publicly due to a misconfiguration *within Slim's routing setup*, specifically a lack of proper middleware to protect them. This is a direct Slim issue because the routing configuration is managed by Slim.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Slim Component:** `Slim\Routing\RouteCollector`, `Slim\App::map`, and any middleware *intended* for authentication/authorization but misconfigured or missing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use middleware to restrict access to internal routes based on user roles, IP addresses, or other criteria, *ensuring this middleware is correctly placed in Slim's pipeline*.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all internal routes.
        *   Clearly separate internal and external routes in the application's code and configuration *within Slim's routing setup*.
        *   Regularly review the route configuration *within Slim* to ensure that no internal routes are accidentally exposed.
