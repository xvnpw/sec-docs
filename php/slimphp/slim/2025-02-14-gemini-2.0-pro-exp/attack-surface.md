# Attack Surface Analysis for slimphp/slim

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_manipulation.md)

*Description:* Attackers inject malicious values into route parameters defined by Slim's routing system to cause unexpected behavior, bypass security, or access unauthorized data.
*Slim Contribution:* Slim's routing mechanism is the *direct* enabler of this attack vector.  The framework provides the means to define and extract these parameters; the vulnerability arises from insufficient developer-implemented validation *within* the Slim application.
*Example:* Route: `/users/{id}/profile`.  Attacker tries: `/users/-1/profile`, `/users/../../etc/passwd/profile`, `/users/999999999999/profile`.
*Impact:* Data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service, application crashes, potential remote code execution (if parameters are used unsafely in system calls that are triggered via Slim routes).
*Risk Severity:* **High to Critical** (depending on how parameters are used within the Slim application logic).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Use regular expressions within Slim route definitions to enforce expected parameter formats (e.g., `->where('id', '[0-9]+')`).
    *   **Type Hinting:** Use type hints in Slim route callbacks where possible (e.g., `function (Request $request, Response $response, int $id)`) to enforce basic type checking.
    *   **Whitelist Approach:** If feasible, define a whitelist of allowed values *within* the Slim route handling logic.
    *   **Context-Specific Validation:** Validate parameters based on their intended use *within* the Slim route handler (e.g., if used in a database query, ensure they are properly escaped *before* interacting with the database).
    *   **Avoid Direct Use:** Don't use parameters directly in file paths, system commands, or database queries *within* Slim route handlers without proper sanitization and escaping. Use them as lookup keys instead.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Bypass or Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/middleware_bypass_or_misconfiguration.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in one Slim middleware component or the middleware execution order (defined within the Slim application) to bypass security checks implemented in other middleware.
*Slim Contribution:* Slim's core architecture *is* the middleware pipeline.  The framework provides the mechanism for defining and ordering middleware; the vulnerability arises from incorrect ordering or vulnerabilities within individual middleware components *as configured within the Slim application*.
*Example:* Authentication middleware placed *after* logging middleware in the Slim application, allowing malicious requests to be logged before authentication fails. Or, a CSRF middleware that can be bypassed by manipulating request headers, and this bypass is successful because of the order in which it's applied in the Slim app.
*Impact:* Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, data leakage, potential for other attacks depending on the bypassed middleware configured in the Slim application.
*Risk Severity:* **High to Critical** (depending on the bypassed security controls).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Correct Middleware Order:** Place security-critical middleware (authentication, authorization, input validation) early in the Slim application's middleware chain. This is a *direct* configuration within the Slim app.
    *   **Robust Middleware:** Ensure each middleware component used *within the Slim application* is secure and doesn't have vulnerabilities.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Test the entire Slim application's middleware stack with various malicious inputs.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Each middleware registered with Slim should only have the necessary permissions.
    *   **Careful Selection of Middleware:** When choosing third-party middleware for use *with Slim*, prioritize well-vetted, community-maintained options.

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Dependency Injection Container Configuration](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_dependency_injection_container_configuration.md)

*Description:* Attackers inject malicious service definitions into Slim's DI container, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*Slim Contribution:* Slim *uses* a DI container (Pimple, by default).  The vulnerability arises if the *Slim application* loads the DI container configuration from untrusted sources. This is a direct configuration choice within the Slim application.
*Example:* The Slim application loading DI container configuration from user input or an unvalidated external file, allowing an attacker to specify the class name of a service to be instantiated.
*Impact:* Remote code execution, complete application compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Never Load from Untrusted Sources:** Hardcode service definitions within the Slim application or load them from secure, trusted configuration files *only*. This is a *direct* configuration aspect of the Slim application.
    *   **Strict Validation:** If configuration *must* be loaded from an external source for the Slim DI container, implement extremely strict validation and sanitization. Prefer a whitelist approach.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Class Instantiation (Based on User Input):** Do not configure the Slim DI container to instantiate classes based on user-supplied class names. This is a configuration choice *within* the Slim application.
