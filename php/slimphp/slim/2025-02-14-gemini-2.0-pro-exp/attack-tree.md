## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Bypass Middleware Logic -> Missing Authorization Checks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_bypass_middleware_logic_-_missing_authorization_checks.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This attack path focuses on bypassing security controls implemented within Slim's middleware system. The attacker aims to access protected resources without proper authorization.

*   **Attack Vector: Bypass Middleware Logic**
    *   *Description:* The attacker attempts to circumvent the intended flow of middleware execution. This could involve finding ways to access routes without triggering the necessary authentication or authorization middleware.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (Common oversight in development)
    *   *Impact:* High to Very High (Direct access to protected resources)
    *   *Effort:* Very Low (Simply accessing the unprotected route)
    *   *Skill Level:* Very Low
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to High (Requires careful auditing of access logs and security configurations)

*   **Critical Node: [***Missing Authorization Checks***]**
    *   *Description:* This represents the core vulnerability – the absence of proper authorization checks on a route or resource. This allows an attacker to access resources they should not be able to.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium (Common oversight in development)
    *   *Impact:* High to Very High (Direct access to protected resources)
    *   *Effort:* Very Low (Simply accessing the unprotected route)
    *   *Skill Level:* Very Low
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to High (Requires careful auditing of access logs and security configurations)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   Implement authorization checks on *every* route that requires it.
        *   Use a consistent and well-tested authorization mechanism (e.g., role-based access control).
        *   Ensure middleware is applied correctly and in the right order (authentication *before* authorization).
        *   Regularly audit route configurations and middleware application.
        *   Use automated tools to check for missing authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Request/Response Handling -> Bypass Input Validation -> No Input Validation on Route Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_requestresponse_handling_-_bypass_input_validation_-_no_input_validation_on_r_342e264d.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This attack path targets vulnerabilities arising from inadequate input validation, specifically focusing on route parameters. The attacker aims to inject malicious data to exploit vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, or cross-site scripting.

*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Request/Response Handling**
     *   *Description:* The attacker targets how the Slim application handles incoming requests and outgoing responses. This is a broad category, but in this high-risk path, the focus is on the lack of input validation.
     *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High (Very common vulnerability if input isn't sanitized)
     *   *Impact:* Medium to Very High (SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
     *   *Effort:* Low to Medium (Depends on the specific vulnerability)
     *   *Skill Level:* Low to High (Basic SQL injection is easy; more complex attacks require more skill)
     *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low to Medium (SQL injection can be detected by input validation and security tools; other injection attacks might be harder to detect)

*   **Attack Vector: Bypass Input Validation**
    *   *Description:* The attacker attempts to send data that bypasses any existing (but insufficient) input validation mechanisms. This could involve using unexpected characters, encodings, or data types.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High (Very common vulnerability if input isn't sanitized)
    *   *Impact:* Medium to Very High (SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
    *   *Effort:* Low to Medium (Depends on the specific vulnerability)
    *   *Skill Level:* Low to High (Basic SQL injection is easy; more complex attacks require more skill)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low to Medium (SQL injection can be detected by input validation and security tools; other injection attacks might be harder to detect)

*   **Critical Node: [***No Input Validation on Route Parameters***]**
    *   *Description:* This is the critical vulnerability – the complete absence of, or grossly inadequate, input validation on data extracted from route parameters. This allows attackers to inject malicious payloads directly into application logic.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High (Very common vulnerability if input isn't sanitized)
    *   *Impact:* Medium to Very High (SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
    *   *Effort:* Low to Medium (Depends on the specific vulnerability)
    *   *Skill Level:* Low to High (Basic SQL injection is easy; more complex attacks require more skill)
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Low to Medium (SQL injection can be detected by input validation and security tools; other injection attacks might be harder to detect)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   Implement robust input validation for *all* route parameters.
        *   Use a validation library to enforce data types, formats, and lengths.
        *   Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions.
        *   Treat route parameters as untrusted input, *always*.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help detect and block injection attacks.
        *   Regularly perform security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and address input validation vulnerabilities.
