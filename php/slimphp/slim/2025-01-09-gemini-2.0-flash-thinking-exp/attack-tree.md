## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**
    * This is a critical entry point as all user requests are processed through the routing mechanism.
    * Weaknesses here can allow attackers to bypass intended application logic and access sensitive functionalities directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Route Parameter Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__route_parameter_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Route Parameter Injection (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers craft malicious input within URL parameters.
    * The application fails to properly sanitize or validate these parameters before using them.
    * This can lead to:
        * **[CRITICAL] Leads to SQL Injection (High-Risk Path):** Malicious input in route parameters is directly used in database queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Leads to SQL Injection (if used in DB queries) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__leads_to_sql_injection__if_used_in_db_queries___high-risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Leads to SQL Injection (High-Risk Path):** Malicious input in route parameters is directly used in database queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Malicious Middleware Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__malicious_middleware_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Malicious Middleware Injection (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers inject their own malicious middleware into the application's request pipeline.
    * This is often achieved by:
        * **[CRITICAL] Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependency Injection Container (High-Risk Path):** Weaknesses in the DI container allow attackers to manipulate service definitions.
            * **Overwriting Existing Middleware with Malicious Code:** Attackers replace legitimate middleware with their own malicious code, gaining control over request processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependency Injection Container (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_dependency_injection_container__high-risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dependency Injection Container (High-Risk Path):** Weaknesses in the DI container allow attackers to manipulate service definitions.
            * **Overwriting Existing Middleware with Malicious Code:** Attackers replace legitimate middleware with their own malicious code, gaining control over request processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Exploit Dependency Injection Container Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_dependency_injection_container_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit Dependency Injection Container Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**
    * The Dependency Injection (DI) container manages application components.
    * Vulnerabilities here allow attackers to manipulate these components and their dependencies.
    * **[CRITICAL] Service Definition Manipulation (High-Risk Path):**
        * **Overwriting Service Definitions with Malicious Objects:** Attackers replace legitimate service definitions with malicious objects, allowing them to control the behavior of the application's components.
        * **Modifying Service Factories to Return Malicious Instances:** Attackers alter the factories responsible for creating service instances, causing them to return malicious objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Service Definition Manipulation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__service_definition_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Service Definition Manipulation (High-Risk Path):**
        * **Overwriting Service Definitions with Malicious Objects:** Attackers replace legitimate service definitions with malicious objects, allowing them to control the behavior of the application's components.
        * **Modifying Service Factories to Return Malicious Instances:** Attackers alter the factories responsible for creating service instances, causing them to return malicious objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Exploit View Layer Vulnerabilities (If Applicable - using template engines) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_view_layer_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_-_using_template_engines___high-risk_pa_2ac9b68a.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Exploit View Layer Vulnerabilities (If Applicable - using template engines) (High-Risk Path):**
    * This applies if the application uses a template engine (like Twig or Plates).
    * **[CRITICAL] Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (High-Risk Path):**
        * **Injecting Malicious Code into Template Variables:** Attackers inject code into template variables that is then executed by the template engine on the server.
        * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Template Engine Itself:** Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities within the template engine to execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL]** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__server-side_template_injection__ssti___high-risk_path_.md)

* **[CRITICAL] Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (High-Risk Path):**
        * **Injecting Malicious Code into Template Variables:** Attackers inject code into template variables that is then executed by the template engine on the server.
        * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Template Engine Itself:** Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities within the template engine to execute arbitrary code.
