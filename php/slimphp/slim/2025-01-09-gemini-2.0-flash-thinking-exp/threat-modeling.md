# Threat Model Analysis for slimphp/slim

## Threat: [Middleware Bypass due to Ordering Issues](./threats/middleware_bypass_due_to_ordering_issues.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits incorrect ordering of middleware to bypass security checks. For example, authentication middleware might be placed after middleware that processes potentially malicious input, allowing the attacker to send requests without proper authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, potential execution of actions without proper authorization, data breaches.

**Affected Slim Component:** `Slim\App` (middleware pipeline processing).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Carefully plan and define the order of middleware execution, ensuring security-related middleware is executed early in the pipeline.
*   Thoroughly test the middleware pipeline to confirm the intended order and behavior.
*   Document the intended middleware execution order for future reference.

## Threat: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers that the application is running in debug mode. This can expose sensitive information, debugging tools, and potentially allow for code execution or other malicious activities.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution or other severe vulnerabilities depending on the debugging tools available.

**Affected Slim Component:** `Slim\App` (configuration settings related to debug mode).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure debug mode is disabled in production environments. This is a critical configuration step.
*   Implement checks to prevent debug mode from being accidentally enabled in production deployments.
