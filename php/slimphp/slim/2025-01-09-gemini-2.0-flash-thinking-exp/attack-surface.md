# Attack Surface Analysis for slimphp/slim

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_injection.md)

**Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code or unexpected data into route parameters, leading to unintended application behavior.

**How Slim Contributes:** Slim's routing mechanism allows defining routes with parameters (e.g., `/users/{id}`). If these parameters are directly used in database queries or other sensitive operations without proper sanitization, it creates an injection point.

**Example:** A route defined as `/users/{id}`. An attacker could access `/users/'; DROP TABLE users;--` if the `id` is directly used in an SQL query without proper escaping.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, denial of service, or even remote code execution depending on the context of the injection.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all route parameters against expected data types and formats.
*   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Output Encoding:** Encode output when displaying data derived from route parameters to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Method Spoofing Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/method_spoofing_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit Slim's ability to override the HTTP request method using the `_METHOD` parameter (often in forms) to bypass intended access controls.

**How Slim Contributes:** Slim explicitly supports method spoofing, allowing developers to simulate PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests from standard HTML forms. If not carefully managed, this can be abused.

**Example:** A form intended for updating a resource via a `PUT` request. An attacker could change the method to `DELETE` via the `_METHOD` field, potentially deleting the resource if the server-side logic doesn't strictly verify the actual request method.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification or deletion, bypassing intended application logic.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable Method Spoofing (if not needed):** If your application doesn't rely on method spoofing, disable it in Slim's configuration.
*   **Verify Actual Request Method:** On the server-side, verify the actual HTTP request method in addition to relying solely on the `_METHOD` parameter.
*   **Use Appropriate HTTP Methods:** Design your API and forms to use the correct HTTP methods inherently, minimizing the need for spoofing.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Template Engine Integration](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_template_engine_integration.md)

**Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into template directives, leading to server-side code execution.

**How Slim Contributes:** While Slim itself doesn't have a built-in template engine, it's often used with template engines like Twig or Plates. If user-controlled data is directly embedded into template code without proper sanitization, it can lead to SSTI.

**Example:** Using Twig, if user input is directly placed within a Twig expression like `{{ user.name }}` without proper escaping, an attacker could inject `{{ _self.env.getRuntimeLoader().getSourceContext('index.twig').getCode() }}` to read server-side files.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Embedding User Input in Template Code:**  Never directly embed user-provided data into template code.
*   **Use Template Auto-Escaping:** Enable auto-escaping features provided by your template engine.
*   **Sandbox Template Environment:** If possible, configure the template engine to run in a sandboxed environment with restricted access to server resources.
*   **Regularly Update Template Engine:** Keep the template engine library up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
