# Threat Model Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Threat: [Compromised Mockery Package](./threats/compromised_mockery_package.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the `mockery/mockery` package on Packagist or the GitHub repository. They inject malicious code into the package. When developers install or update Mockery, they unknowingly download and use the compromised version. The attacker could use this to gain access to developer machines or inject vulnerabilities into the application codebase during development.

**Impact:**

*   Data exfiltration from developer machines (credentials, source code, etc.).
*   Introduction of backdoors or vulnerabilities into the application under development.
*   Compromise of developer accounts and systems.

**Mockery Component Affected:** Package distribution (Packagist, GitHub repository).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Verify package integrity using checksums or package signing (if available).
*   Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies (though Mockery has minimal dependencies).
*   Regularly update Mockery to the latest stable version from trusted sources.
*   Consider using a private Packagist mirror or repository with stricter access controls for internal projects.
*   Monitor security advisories related to Packagist and the PHP ecosystem.
