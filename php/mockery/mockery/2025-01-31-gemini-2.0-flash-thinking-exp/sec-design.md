# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Mockery, is a mocking framework for PHP. It aims to simplify unit testing in PHP by allowing developers to easily create mock objects for dependencies, leading to more isolated and effective tests.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Improve software quality: By facilitating unit testing, Mockery helps developers write more robust and reliable code.
- Increase development efficiency: Mockery simplifies the process of creating mocks, saving developers time and effort in writing tests.
- Reduce bugs and regressions: Thorough unit testing, enabled by tools like Mockery, helps catch bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the risk of regressions in later stages.
- Enhance code maintainability: Well-tested code is generally easier to maintain and refactor over time.

Business Risks:
- Dependency on open-source project: The project relies on an external open-source library. Risks include project abandonment, security vulnerabilities in the library, or lack of timely updates.
- Incorrect usage leading to false positives/negatives in tests: If Mockery is not used correctly, tests might not accurately reflect the behavior of the system, leading to false confidence or missed issues.
- Compatibility issues with PHP versions or other libraries:  Changes in PHP or other libraries might break compatibility with Mockery, requiring updates and potentially disrupting development workflows.
- Security vulnerabilities in generated mocks (unlikely but theoretically possible): Although Mockery primarily generates test code, there's a theoretical risk of vulnerabilities if the generated mocks interact with the application in unexpected ways or if the mocking framework itself has vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Usage of GitHub for source code management and collaboration. (Implemented in: GitHub repository)
- security control: Issue tracking and pull request reviews on GitHub. (Implemented in: GitHub repository)
- security control: Automated testing via GitHub Actions. (Implemented in: `.github/workflows` directory in the repository)
- security control: Static analysis and linting as part of the development process (potentially, based on common PHP development practices, but not explicitly stated in the input). (Potentially implemented via developer tooling and CI pipelines)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security patches and updates.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies (although Mockery itself has minimal dependencies).
- accepted risk: Risk of developer misconfiguration or misuse leading to security issues in applications using Mockery (indirect risk).

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- security control: Regularly review and update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Encourage secure coding practices among developers using Mockery, especially when integrating mocks with real systems.
- security control: Consider code signing releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of distributed packages.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Mockery itself as it's a development tool and not a user-facing application. Authentication is relevant for accessing the GitHub repository and related development infrastructure.
- Authorization: Authorization is relevant for controlling access to the GitHub repository and related development infrastructure. For Mockery itself, authorization is not a primary concern.
- Input Validation: Input validation is relevant in the context of code generation. Mockery needs to correctly parse and process PHP code to generate mocks. Incorrect input handling could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors during mock generation.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for Mockery. However, if Mockery were to handle sensitive data (which it generally doesn't), cryptographic measures would be necessary. For now, it's not a high priority.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the GitHub Repository.
2. GitHub Actions CI pipeline is triggered automatically on code commits (and potentially pull requests, tags, etc.).
3. The CI pipeline performs the following steps:
    - Build: Packages the Mockery library (likely into a Composer package).
    - Tests: Executes unit tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Lints: Runs code linters and static analysis tools to check for code style and potential issues.
    - Scans: Performs dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Potentially includes SAST scanning for source code vulnerabilities.
4. Build Artifacts (e.g., Composer package) are created.
5. The build artifacts are published to Packagist, the primary PHP package registry.
6. PHP developers can then download and use Mockery via Composer, pulling it from Packagist.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes Protected:
- Software Development Lifecycle: Mockery supports unit testing, which is a critical part of the software development lifecycle, contributing to software quality and reducing bugs.
- Open-Source Software Distribution: The build and release process ensures that Mockery is built, tested, and distributed reliably to the PHP developer community.

Data We Are Trying to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Source Code: The source code of Mockery itself is publicly available on GitHub. Integrity and availability are important to ensure developers can rely on the library. Confidentiality is less of a concern as it's open source.
- Build Artifacts (Composer Package): The integrity and authenticity of the distributed Composer package are crucial. Developers need to trust that the package they download from Packagist is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.
- Test Code: Test code within the Mockery repository is also public. Integrity and availability are important for maintaining the quality of the library.

Data Sensitivity:
- Publicly available source code and test code: Low confidentiality sensitivity.
- Build artifacts: High integrity and authenticity sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Are there any specific security scanning tools used in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline (e.g., SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)?
- Is code signing used for releases to ensure package integrity?
- What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in Mockery or its dependencies?
- Are there any specific security guidelines or secure coding practices followed during the development of Mockery?

Assumptions:
- The project aims to follow standard secure software development practices, including testing and code review.
- GitHub Actions CI is used for automated build, test, and potentially security checks.
- Packagist is used as the primary distribution channel for the Composer package.
- Developers using Mockery are responsible for the security of their own applications and how they use Mockery within them.
- The primary security concerns for Mockery are related to supply chain security (ensuring the integrity of the distributed package) and the security of the development process itself.
