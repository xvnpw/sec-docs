# Attack Surface Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Attack Surface: [Dynamic Code Generation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dynamic_code_generation_vulnerabilities.md)

### Description:
*   Mockery's core functionality relies on generating PHP code dynamically at runtime to create mock objects.  If this code generation process is compromised or manipulated, it could lead to unintended code execution.
### Mockery Contribution:
*   Mockery *directly* contributes to this attack surface as dynamic code generation is its fundamental mechanism for creating mocks. Any flaw or vulnerability related to this process is inherently linked to Mockery.
### Example:
*   In a highly improbable and contrived scenario, imagine a custom extension or a very specific misuse of Mockery where external, untrusted data could somehow influence the *structure* of the dynamically generated mock class definition *during runtime*. If this were possible, a malicious actor *could* theoretically inject PHP code snippets into this untrusted data, which would then be incorporated into the dynamically generated code and executed when the mock object is instantiated or used.  While extremely unlikely in typical, secure usage of Mockery, the *potential* for code injection exists due to the dynamic nature of code generation.
### Impact:
*   Arbitrary code execution within the testing environment. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive test data, manipulation of test results, or potentially further compromise of the testing infrastructure if not properly isolated.
### Risk Severity:
*   **High** (While the *likelihood* of direct exploitation of this attack surface in standard, secure Mockery usage is low, the *potential impact* of arbitrary code execution is significant.  The severity is elevated due to the inherent risks associated with dynamic code generation and the potential consequences if this process is somehow compromised through misuse or unforeseen edge cases.)
### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Secure Development Practices:**  Strictly avoid using any external, untrusted input to influence the structure or behavior of mock objects *during runtime*. Mock definitions should be statically defined within test code and not dynamically constructed based on external data.
*   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review test code and any custom extensions or frameworks built around Mockery to ensure that mock definitions are safe, controlled, and do not introduce any pathways for untrusted data to influence dynamic code generation.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Testing Environment):**  Run tests in a restricted environment with minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities. Isolate the testing environment from production systems and sensitive data where possible.
*   **Regular Mockery Updates:** Keep Mockery updated to the latest version to benefit from any bug fixes or security improvements in the library's code generation logic and related security considerations.
