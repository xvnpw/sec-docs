## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse/Accidental Inclusion of Mockery in Production [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/misuseaccidental_inclusion_of_mockery_in_production__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This is the overarching category encompassing the most likely ways Mockery can become a security risk. It's not a direct exploit, but a *condition* that enables further exploitation.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Accidental Deployment of Test Code with Mockery [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Failure in Build/Deployment Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Pipeline misconfiguration allows test directories to be included [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  A misconfigured CI/CD pipeline fails to properly exclude test directories (containing Mockery and test code) during the build and deployment process.
                *   **Example:**  The pipeline configuration might use a wildcard that inadvertently includes test folders, or lack specific exclusion rules for test-related files.
            *   **Human error in deployment process (e.g., manual deployment including test files) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  During manual deployment steps, a developer or operator mistakenly includes test directories or Mockery-related files in the production deployment package.
                *   **Example:**  Copying the entire project directory instead of a build artifact, or manually selecting files for upload and accidentally including test folders.
        *   **Inadequate Separation of Development and Production Environments [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Shared codebase or repository for development and production without proper branching/tagging [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Using the same codebase branch for both development and production without proper branching or tagging strategies increases the risk of deploying development code (including Mockery) to production.
                *   **Example:**  Directly deploying from the `main` branch which also contains development and testing code, instead of using a dedicated release branch or tags.
            *   **Lack of environment-specific build processes [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Using the same build process for both development and production environments, without differentiating dependencies or build outputs, can lead to Mockery being included in production builds.
                *   **Example:**  Running the same `composer install` command in both environments without using environment-specific flags or configurations to exclude development dependencies in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Mock Behavior if Mockery Code is Accidentally in Production [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_mock_behavior_if_mockery_code_is_accidentally_in_production__high-risk_path__critical_nod_a61b6c91.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  If Mockery code is accidentally deployed to production (as described in point 1), an attacker can potentially exploit the presence of Mockery to manipulate application behavior. This requires Mockery classes and functions to be accessible and usable within the production environment.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Mockery classes/functions are accessible in production environment [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** This is a prerequisite for exploiting mock behavior. If Mockery classes are loaded and available in the production runtime, they can be instantiated and used.
        *   **Example:**  Mockery classes are included in the deployed codebase and are autoloaded by the application's autoloader.
    *   **Predictable or Manipulable Mock Definitions [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Mockery is used to mock critical components in production (due to accidental inclusion) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Critical business logic or security checks are replaced by mocks [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If Mockery is present and used to mock critical components (due to accidental inclusion or copy-paste errors), attackers can potentially bypass security checks or manipulate business logic by influencing the behavior of these mocks.
                *   **Example:**  Authentication or authorization services, data validation routines, or critical business rules are mocked, allowing an attacker to bypass these checks by manipulating mock expectations or return values (if they can somehow influence mock behavior - less likely but theoretically possible in extreme misuse scenarios).
    *   **Exploitable consequences of mocked behavior [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Bypassing authentication/authorization checks due to mocked dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  If authentication or authorization services are mocked in production, an attacker could potentially bypass these checks by exploiting the predictable or manipulable nature of the mocks.
            *   **Example:**  Mocks always return "authenticated" or "authorized" regardless of user credentials, granting unauthorized access.
        *   **Data manipulation due to mocked data sources or services [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If data sources or services are mocked in production, an attacker could potentially manipulate data by influencing the mocked responses.
            *   **Example:**  Mocks return attacker-controlled data instead of real data, leading to data corruption or manipulation of application logic based on this fake data.
