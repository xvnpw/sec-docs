*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in one of Mockery's dependencies. They then craft an exploit that leverages this vulnerability when Mockery is used in a development or testing environment. This could involve providing specific input or triggering certain actions that exploit the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the development machine or potentially within the application's testing environment, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Dependencies (specified in `composer.json` or similar).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Mockery and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., using `composer audit`) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the development pipeline.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Mockery Package Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the source from which Mockery is installed (e.g., a compromised Packagist mirror or a man-in-the-middle attack during installation). They replace the legitimate Mockery package with a malicious version containing backdoors or other malicious code. Developers unknowingly install this compromised package.
    *   **Impact:** The malicious Mockery package can inject arbitrary code into the generated mock objects or the application's testing environment, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or the introduction of further vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Installation process (using Composer or similar package managers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure and trusted package repositories.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or signatures if available.
        *   Utilize `composer.lock` to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments.
        *   Implement security scanning of the development environment.

*   **Threat:** Generated Code Injection via Malicious Input
    *   **Description:** While less common in typical usage, if the input used to define mock behaviors (e.g., method names, return values) is derived from untrusted sources and not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious code snippets that are then included in the generated mock objects.
    *   **Impact:** When these generated mocks are used during testing, the injected malicious code could be executed, potentially compromising the testing environment or revealing sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Code generation logic within Mockery.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using untrusted input directly when defining mock behaviors.
        *   Sanitize or validate any external data used in mock definitions.
        *   Treat mock definitions as code and apply appropriate security considerations.
