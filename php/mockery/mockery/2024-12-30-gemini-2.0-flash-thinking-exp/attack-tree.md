## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Mockery - Focused on High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities introduced by the use of the `mockery/mockery` library during development.

**High-Risk and Critical Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using Mockery **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Mockery Library Itself **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
        * Compromise Mockery Package **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            * Compromise Packagist Account of Mockery Maintainer
            * Inject Malicious Code into Mockery Package
        * Impact:
            * Malicious code executed during development/testing **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
    * Exploit Misuse or Configuration Issues of Mockery
        * Impact:
            * Leakage of API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information. **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Impact:
            * Security vulnerabilities in critical components remain undetected. **[CRITICAL NODE]**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application Using Mockery [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Attack Vector:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of weaknesses related to Mockery that leads to the compromise of the application falls under this category.
* **Impact:** Full control over the application, including data breaches, service disruption, and potential further attacks on connected systems.

**2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Mockery Library Itself [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the `mockery/mockery` library itself. This can be achieved by directly targeting the library's codebase or its distribution mechanism.
* **Impact:**  Potentially widespread compromise of applications using the vulnerable version of Mockery.

**3. Compromise Mockery Package [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains control over the `mockery/mockery` package on Packagist, the primary PHP package repository. This can be done by:
    * **Compromise Packagist Account of Mockery Maintainer:**  The attacker gains access to the Packagist account credentials of a maintainer of the Mockery package. This could be through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the maintainer's systems.
    * **Inject Malicious Code into Mockery Package:** Once in control, the attacker injects malicious code into the Mockery package. This code could be designed to execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate data, or introduce backdoors when the package is installed or used by developers.
* **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the development environments of all applications that depend on the compromised version of Mockery. This can lead to data breaches, environment compromise, and supply chain attacks on other dependencies.

**4. Malicious code executed during development/testing [HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]:**

* **Attack Vector:**  As a consequence of a compromised Mockery package, the malicious code injected into the library is executed during the development or testing phase of applications using it. This happens when developers install or update dependencies using Composer, or when tests that utilize the compromised Mockery library are run.
* **Impact:**  The malicious code can perform various actions within the developer's environment, such as:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information from the developer's machine or the application's development environment.
    * **Environment Compromise:** Gaining control over the developer's machine or the development environment.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Injecting further malicious code into the application's codebase or other dependencies.

**5. Leakage of API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information. [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Attack Vector:** This can occur due to the misuse or misconfiguration of Mockery:
    * **Overly Permissive Mocking:** Mock objects are configured to return actual sensitive data that should not be present in tests. This data can then be accidentally logged, exposed in error messages, or leaked through other channels.
    * **Accidental Inclusion of Sensitive Data in Mock Definitions:** Developers mistakenly hardcode real API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information directly into the definitions of mock objects within the test codebase.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials can lead to full compromise of the application's backend systems, databases, and external services.

**6. Security vulnerabilities in critical components remain undetected. [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Attack Vector:** This arises from the practice of heavily mocking security-sensitive components during unit testing:
    * **Inadequate Testing of Security Controls:**  Core security mechanisms like authentication, authorization, and input validation are mocked out, preventing thorough testing of their real-world implementation.
    * **Mocking Out Error Handling:** Mock objects are configured to always return success, masking potential error conditions and vulnerabilities that might exist in the actual error handling logic of the application.
* **Impact:**  Critical security vulnerabilities in the application's core components go undetected during testing and are deployed to production, making the application susceptible to exploitation.
