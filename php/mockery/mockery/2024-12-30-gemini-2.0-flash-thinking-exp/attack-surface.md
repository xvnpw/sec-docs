* **Attack Surface:** File System Access During Mock Generation
    * **Description:** Mockery often writes generated mock classes to the file system. Misconfigured permissions on these directories could allow attackers with local access to modify or replace generated mock files.
    * **How Mockery Contributes:** Mockery's default behavior involves writing generated code to files.
    * **Example:** If the directory where Mockery writes mock files has world-writable permissions, an attacker with access to the server could replace a legitimate mock with a malicious one. When tests are run, this malicious mock could execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** High. Modifying generated mocks can lead to arbitrary code execution during testing or potentially even in development environments if these files are inadvertently included in deployments.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the directories where Mockery writes generated files have restrictive permissions, limiting access to the web server user and developers.
        * Regularly review file system permissions in development and testing environments.
        * Consider using in-memory mock generation if possible, though this might not be supported by all Mockery features or testing frameworks.

* **Attack Surface:** Bypassing Security Checks in Tests
    * **Description:** Mocks are designed to replace real dependencies, including those that enforce security measures. If mocks are not carefully designed, they can inadvertently bypass these checks, masking vulnerabilities in the actual application logic.
    * **How Mockery Contributes:** Mockery facilitates the creation of these replacement objects, making it easy to bypass real security implementations during testing.
    * **Example:** A mock for an authentication service might always return "true" for `isAuthenticated()`, allowing tests to pass even if the real authentication logic has vulnerabilities. An attacker understanding the test suite could exploit these bypassed checks in a non-testing environment.
    * **Impact:** Medium to High. False sense of security, potential for vulnerabilities to go undetected and be deployed to production.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Design mocks that accurately reflect the behavior of the real dependencies, including security aspects where relevant.
        * Implement integration tests that exercise the full application stack, including real security components.
        * Conduct security testing (e.g., penetration testing) in environments that do not rely on mocks for security-sensitive components.
        * Regularly review mock implementations to ensure they are not overly permissive.

* **Attack Surface:** Indirect Deserialization Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** If mock objects are serialized and later deserialized, vulnerabilities in the application's deserialization process could be exploited. Maliciously crafted serialized mock objects could potentially trigger code execution upon deserialization.
    * **How Mockery Contributes:** Mockery creates objects that might be subject to serialization and deserialization within the testing framework or application.
    * **Example:** A testing framework might cache test results, including serialized mock objects. If the deserialization process is vulnerable, an attacker could craft a malicious serialized mock object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** High. Deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid serializing and deserializing mock objects unless absolutely necessary.
        * If serialization is required, ensure the deserialization process is secure and protected against known vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using safer alternatives to serialization if possible.
