# Attack Surface Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Attack Surface: [Code Generation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/code_generation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Mockery generates PHP code dynamically to create mock objects. Flaws in Mockery's code generation logic could lead to the generation of insecure code.
    *   **How Mockery Contributes:** Mockery's core functionality involves building PHP code strings or using reflection to create mock objects. If this process has vulnerabilities, it could be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A bug in Mockery's handling of certain method signatures or argument types could allow an attacker to craft a scenario where Mockery generates code that introduces a vulnerability, such as a bypass of access controls during testing.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for unexpected behavior during testing, possibility of introducing subtle vulnerabilities into the codebase if developers rely on flawed mock behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Mockery updated to the latest version, as updates often include bug fixes and security improvements.
        *   Review the Mockery codebase for potential vulnerabilities if contributing or deeply concerned about this risk.
        *   Exercise caution when using advanced or less common Mockery features, as these might have less scrutiny.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Inclusion of Mock Code in Production](./attack_surfaces/accidental_inclusion_of_mock_code_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** While primarily a testing tool, there's a risk that mock definitions or the Mockery library itself could be accidentally included in production deployments.
    *   **How Mockery Contributes:** Developers might mistakenly include the `vendor/mockery` directory or specific mock files in the production build process.
    *   **Example:** Mock objects in production could lead to unexpected behavior if they override real implementations, potentially bypassing security checks or returning incorrect data, leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**  Unexpected application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if mocks bypass security logic, data corruption, unauthorized access, performance overhead.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement clear separation between development/testing and production environments.
        *   Use a robust build process that explicitly includes only necessary files for production.
        *   Utilize `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms to exclude Mockery and mock definition files from version control in production deployments.
        *   Perform thorough testing of production builds to ensure no testing-related code is included.
