# Attack Tree Analysis for mockery/mockery

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise an application that uses the `mockery` library by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities introduced through its use.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   **Exploit Mock Usage in Application Logic** **(Critical Node)**
    *   ***Logic Errors in Mocks** **(Critical Node)**
        *   Create Flawed Mock Implementations
            *   Developers create mocks with incorrect or incomplete logic, leading to exploitable conditions in the tested code
                *   Bypass security checks
                *   Introduce unexpected state changes
    *   ***Inconsistent Mock Behavior**
        *   Mocks Deviate from Real Implementation
            *   Mocks behave differently than the actual dependencies in production, masking vulnerabilities during testing
                *   Vulnerabilities present in the real implementation are not detected
    *   ***Over-Reliance on Mocks in Security-Sensitive Areas** **(Critical Node)**
        *   Mocking Security Critical Components
            *   Security logic is entirely mocked out during testing, leading to a false sense of security
                *   Real vulnerabilities in security mechanisms are not tested or identified
*   **Exploit Development Environment** **(Critical Node)**
    *   ***Compromised Build Environment** **(Critical Node)**
        *   Malicious Code Injection During Mock Generation
            *   Attacker compromises the build environment where `mockery` is executed
                *   Inject malicious code into the generated mock files during the build process

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mock Usage in Application Logic (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mock_usage_in_application_logic__critical_node_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks stemming from flaws in how mocks are designed and used within the application's logic. Attackers can exploit discrepancies between mock behavior and real implementation, or leverage logic errors within the mocks themselves.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Mocks (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_mocks__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Create Flawed Mock Implementations:** Developers, due to oversight, misunderstanding of the dependency's behavior, or time constraints, might create mocks that don't accurately replicate the real dependency's logic.
    *   **Bypass security checks:** A mock for an authentication service might always return "success," bypassing actual authentication logic in the tested code.
    *   **Introduce unexpected state changes:** A mock for a database interaction might not correctly simulate error conditions or data updates, leading to unexpected application behavior when the real database is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inconsistent Mock Behavior (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inconsistent_mock_behavior__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Mocks Deviate from Real Implementation:** Mocks are simplified representations. If the simplification is too aggressive or misses crucial aspects of the real dependency's behavior, it can mask vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerabilities present in the real implementation are not detected:**  For example, a real API might be vulnerable to injection attacks due to lack of input sanitization. If the mock doesn't simulate this vulnerability, tests will pass, and the vulnerability will remain in the production code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Over-Reliance on Mocks in Security-Sensitive Areas (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/over-reliance_on_mocks_in_security-sensitive_areas__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Mocking Security Critical Components:**  When developers entirely replace security-related components (like authentication, authorization, or input validation) with mocks during testing, the actual security logic is never exercised.
    *   **Real vulnerabilities in security mechanisms are not tested or identified:** This creates a false sense of security. The application might pass all unit tests, but critical security flaws in the actual implementation will go unnoticed until exploited in a real environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Development Environment (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_development_environment__critical_node_.md)

This focuses on compromising the environment where the application is built and tested, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or manipulate the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromised Build Environment (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromised_build_environment__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Malicious Code Injection During Mock Generation:** If an attacker gains control of the build environment (e.g., through compromised CI/CD pipelines, developer machines, or build servers), they can tamper with the mock generation process.
    *   **Inject malicious code into the generated mock files during the build process:** This injected code could be designed to execute when the mocks are used in tests or, in some cases, if mocks are inadvertently included in the final application build, even in production. This allows the attacker to introduce backdoors or other malicious functionality into the application.
