# Threat Model Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Threat: [Compromised `mockery` Binary/Package](./threats/compromised__mockery__binarypackage.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into the `mockery` binary or package hosted on distribution channels. Developers unknowingly download and execute this compromised binary. The malicious code could perform actions like stealing credentials, injecting further malware, or manipulating generated mock code.

**Impact:**  Critical. Could lead to complete compromise of developer machines, exfiltration of sensitive information, and injection of vulnerabilities into the project through manipulated mocks.

**Affected Mockery Component:** Installation Binary/Package

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of the downloaded `mockery` binary using checksums or signatures provided by the official repository.
*   Use trusted package managers and repositories with security scanning features.
*   Implement a process for verifying the authenticity of software downloads.
*   Regularly update `mockery` to benefit from security patches and monitor release notes for security advisories.

## Threat: [Compromised Dependencies of `mockery`](./threats/compromised_dependencies_of__mockery_.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency used by `mockery`. When developers install or update `mockery`, the compromised dependency is also included. The malicious code within the dependency could then be executed during `mockery`'s operation.

**Impact:** High. Similar to a compromised binary, this could lead to arbitrary code execution on developer machines or manipulation of generated mocks, although the attack vector is indirect.

**Affected Mockery Component:** Dependency Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit and update the dependencies of `mockery`.
*   Utilize dependency vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `mockery`'s dependencies.
*   Consider using tools that provide Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and their security status.
*   Pin dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce compromised components.

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Leading to Code Injection](./threats/malicious_configuration_leading_to_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the `mockery` configuration files (e.g., `.mockery.yaml`) manipulates the settings to inject arbitrary code into the generated mock files. This could involve adding malicious code snippets that are then incorporated into the generated mocks.

**Impact:** High. When tests using these generated mocks are executed, the injected malicious code will also be executed, potentially compromising the testing environment or even the application if the generated mocks are inadvertently included in production code.

**Affected Mockery Component:** Configuration Loading and Processing

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to `mockery` configuration files and the directories where they are stored.
*   Implement code reviews for any changes to `mockery` configuration files.
*   Use version control to track changes to configuration files and revert unauthorized modifications.
*   Consider using a more secure method for managing configuration, such as environment variables or dedicated configuration management tools.
