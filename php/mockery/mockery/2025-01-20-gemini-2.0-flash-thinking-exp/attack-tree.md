## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Mockery [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_mockery__critical_node_.md)

**Compromise Application Using Mockery:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mock Definition Source](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mock_definition_source.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Interface Definition](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_interface_definition.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Interface Comments/Metadata [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_interface_commentsmetadata__high_risk_.md)

**Supply Malicious Interface Definition -> Inject Malicious Code via Interface Comments/Metadata:**  An attacker attempts to inject malicious code within comments or metadata of the interface definition file. If Mockery's template engine or parsing logic inadvertently processes this as executable code during generation, it could lead to code execution. While the likelihood is low due to the expected behavior of code generation tools, the impact of code execution is high, making this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Dependency Providing Interface Definition [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_dependency_providing_interface_definition__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

**Compromise Dependency Providing Interface Definition:** This is a critical node because if an attacker can compromise a dependency that provides interface definitions to Mockery, they can inject malicious content at a foundational level. This allows them to influence the code generated for multiple mocks, potentially leading to widespread vulnerabilities within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Interface Definition via Compromised Dependency [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_interface_definition_via_compromised_dependency__high_risk_.md)

**Compromise Dependency Providing Interface Definition -> Supply Malicious Interface Definition via Compromised Dependency:**  An attacker compromises an external dependency that provides interface definitions to Mockery. Once compromised, the attacker can inject malicious interface definitions, leading to the generation of compromised mocks. The likelihood depends on the security of the dependency, but the potential for widespread impact makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mockery Code Generation Process [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mockery_code_generation_process__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Mockery Code Generation Process:** This node is critical because it represents a direct attack on Mockery's core functionality. If successful, the attacker can inject arbitrary code directly into the generated mock files, bypassing the need to manipulate interface definitions. This can lead to immediate and severe consequences, such as arbitrary code execution on the build machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Code Injection in Mockery [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_code_injection_in_mockery__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Template Engine [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_template_engine__high_risk_.md)

**Exploit Mockery Code Generation Process -> Trigger Code Injection in Mockery -> Exploit Vulnerability in Template Engine:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in the template engine used by Mockery. By crafting malicious interface definitions, they can trigger the template engine to execute arbitrary code on the machine running Mockery during the code generation process. The impact is critical, allowing for full control of the build environment, even if the likelihood of finding such a vulnerability is low.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Parsing Logic [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_parsing_logic__high_risk_.md)

**Exploit Mockery Code Generation Process -> Trigger Code Injection in Mockery -> Exploit Vulnerability in Parsing Logic:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in Mockery's parsing logic for interface definitions. By providing specially crafted input, they can inject code during the parsing phase, leading to arbitrary code execution on the build machine. Similar to template engine exploitation, the impact is critical despite a lower likelihood.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Development/Deployment Pipeline Using Mockery [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developmentdeployment_pipeline_using_mockery__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

**Compromise Development/Deployment Pipeline Using Mockery:** This node is critical because it targets the processes surrounding the use of Mockery. By compromising the development or deployment pipeline, an attacker can introduce malicious code or manipulate the build process, potentially affecting the final application without directly exploiting vulnerabilities within Mockery itself. This can have a broad impact and be difficult to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Mockery Configuration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_mockery_configuration__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect Mock Generation to Malicious Output Location [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_mock_generation_to_malicious_output_location__high_risk_.md)

**Compromise Development/Deployment Pipeline Using Mockery -> Supply Malicious Mockery Configuration -> Redirect Mock Generation to Malicious Output Location:** An attacker gains access to Mockery's configuration and modifies it to redirect the output of generated mocks to a location they control. This allows them to overwrite legitimate files or introduce malicious code into the build process. While the likelihood depends on the security of the configuration, the potential impact is high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands via Configuration Options (if any) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_via_configuration_options__if_any___high_risk_.md)

**Compromise Development/Deployment Pipeline Using Mockery -> Supply Malicious Mockery Configuration -> Execute Arbitrary Commands via Configuration Options (if any):** If Mockery's configuration allows for the execution of external commands (which is unlikely), an attacker could leverage this to execute arbitrary commands on the build server. Even with a very low likelihood, the critical impact of gaining control over the build environment makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Mockery CLI Tool [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_mockery_cli_tool__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Input Parameters [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_input_parameters__high_risk_.md)

**Compromise Development/Deployment Pipeline Using Mockery -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Mockery CLI Tool -> Command Injection via Input Parameters:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Mockery CLI tool where input parameters are not properly sanitized. By providing malicious input, they can inject commands that are executed by the shell on the build machine. The impact is critical, allowing for arbitrary code execution, even if the likelihood is low due to expected input sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Generated Mocks [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_generated_mocks__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Replace Legitimate Mocks with Malicious Ones in Build Artifacts [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/replace_legitimate_mocks_with_malicious_ones_in_build_artifacts__high_risk_.md)

**Compromise Development/Deployment Pipeline Using Mockery -> Supply Malicious Generated Mocks -> Replace Legitimate Mocks with Malicious Ones in Build Artifacts:** An attacker gains access to the build artifacts or the repository and replaces the legitimately generated mocks with their own malicious versions. This allows them to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the application without directly exploiting Mockery itself. The likelihood depends on the security of the build process and repositories, but the impact of introducing malicious code is high.
