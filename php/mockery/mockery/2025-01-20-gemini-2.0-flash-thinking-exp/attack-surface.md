# Attack Surface Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Mockery Templates](./attack_surfaces/compromised_mockery_templates.md)

**Description:** Malicious code is injected into the templates used by Mockery to generate mock implementations.

**How Mockery Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mockery relies on templates to define the structure and behavior of generated mocks. If these templates are compromised, every mock generated using them will inherit the malicious code.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the default or a custom template repository used by Mockery and adds code to exfiltrate environment variables during mock generation.

**Impact:**  Potentially critical. Malicious code execution during the build or test phase, leading to data breaches, compromised credentials, or supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure Template Sources: Only use trusted and verified template sources. If using custom templates, implement strict access controls and code review processes.
* Template Integrity Checks: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of templates before use (e.g., checksums, digital signatures).
* Regularly Update Mockery: Keep Mockery updated to benefit from any security patches related to template handling.

## Attack Surface: [File System Manipulation during Mock Generation](./attack_surfaces/file_system_manipulation_during_mock_generation.md)

**Description:** Mockery is used in a way that allows writing generated mock files to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting critical files or creating malicious ones.

**How Mockery Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mockery needs write access to the file system to output the generated mock files. Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in how output paths are handled can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates the `outpkg` or `output` flags in the Mockery configuration to write a malicious script to a system startup directory.

**Impact:** High. Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the build system or development machines, denial of service, or data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict Output Paths: Carefully configure the output directory for generated mocks and ensure it's within the project's scope. Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly define output paths.
* Principle of Least Privilege: Run the Mockery generation process with the minimum necessary file system permissions.
* Input Validation: If output paths are dynamically generated, rigorously validate and sanitize the input to prevent directory traversal attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Mockery](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_mockery.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the dependencies used by the Mockery library itself.

**How Mockery Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Like any software, Mockery relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited if not properly managed.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a parsing library used by Mockery could be exploited by providing a specially crafted interface definition, leading to denial of service or even remote code execution during mock generation.

**Impact:** Medium to High. Can lead to denial of service during the build process, or potentially allow attackers to execute code within the build environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly Update Dependencies: Keep Mockery and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Dependency Scanning: Use dependency scanning tools to identify and monitor known vulnerabilities in Mockery's dependencies.
* Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Integrate SCA tools into the development pipeline to gain visibility into the dependencies and their associated risks.
