# Threat Model Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise - Malicious Package Injection](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_-_malicious_package_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the `mockery/mockery` package on Packagist (or a private package repository). They inject malicious code into a new release or update of the library. When developers install or update their dependencies, they unknowingly pull in the compromised version. The malicious code could execute arbitrary commands during the dependency installation process or when the library is used in tests.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on developer machines or CI/CD servers. This could lead to data exfiltration, installation of malware, or modification of the codebase.

**Affected Mockery Component:** The entire package distribution and potentially any part of the library's code that is executed during installation or runtime.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or signatures if available.
*   Monitor package repositories for suspicious activity or unexpected releases.
*   Consider using a private package repository with stricter access controls and vulnerability scanning.
*   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Unsafe Mock Definition Loading](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_unsafe_mock_definition_loading.md)

**Description:** If mock definitions are loaded from external, untrusted sources (e.g., user-provided configuration files, databases without proper sanitization), an attacker could inject malicious PHP code into these definitions. When Mockery processes these definitions, the injected code could be executed.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the development or testing server. This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the environment, access sensitive data, or pivot to other systems.

**Affected Mockery Component:** The parts of Mockery responsible for parsing and interpreting mock definitions, especially if they handle external data sources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never load mock definitions from untrusted or user-controlled sources without thorough sanitization and validation.
*   Store mock definitions in secure locations with appropriate access controls.
*   If external configuration is necessary, use a secure format and parsing mechanism that prevents code injection.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Mock Definitions](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_mock_definitions.md)

**Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, internal URLs) directly within mock definitions. If these definitions are stored in version control or other accessible locations, this information could be exposed to unauthorized individuals.

**Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive credentials or internal information, potentially leading to unauthorized access to systems or data.

**Affected Mockery Component:**  The mock definition files or code where mocks are defined.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in mock definitions.
*   Use environment variables or secure configuration management for sensitive data.
*   Regularly scan your codebase for accidentally committed secrets.
*   Implement proper access controls for version control systems and code repositories.
