# Threat Model Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Threat: [Threat: Production Deployment of Mocked Code](./threats/threat_production_deployment_of_mocked_code.md)

**Threat:** Production Deployment of Mocked Code

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit a misconfigured build process or CI/CD pipeline. If the build system doesn't properly exclude test files and dependencies, the attacker could potentially trigger a deployment that includes `mockery` and mocked components. This could happen if the attacker has access to modify build scripts or inject malicious code that interferes with the build process. The attacker's goal is to replace legitimate code with mocked versions that bypass security checks or introduce vulnerabilities.  The presence of `mockery` and its associated mock definitions in the production environment is the core vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise. The attacker could bypass authentication, authorization, data validation, or other critical security mechanisms. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or complete application failure.
*   **Affected Mockery Component:** The entire `mockery` library and any code that uses `mockery.Mock()`, `mockery.Expectation`, or related functions to define mock objects and behaviors. The critical issue is the *presence* of the library and its use (intended for testing) in a production context.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Build Process:** Implement a build process that *explicitly* excludes test directories and files from production deployments. This should be enforced at multiple levels (e.g., build script, CI/CD configuration).  The build process should *fail* if test artifacts are detected.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system (e.g., `go mod`, `pip`, `npm`) that clearly distinguishes between development and production dependencies. Ensure `mockery` is *only* listed as a development dependency.  The production build should *not* include `mockery`.
    *   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Use environment variables or configuration files to completely disable mocking in production. Ideally, `mockery` should not even be *installed* in the production environment.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews to ensure that no `mockery` imports or calls are present in code intended for production.  This is a critical human check.
    *   **Automated Checks:** Integrate automated checks into the CI/CD pipeline to detect the presence of `mockery` or mocked components in production builds. These checks should *fail* the build if any violations are found.  This is a critical automated check.
    *   **Testing of Build Process:** Regularly test the build and deployment process itself to ensure that it correctly excludes test artifacts. This includes "chaos engineering" style tests that deliberately attempt to introduce test code into production.

## Threat: [Threat: Security Bypass via Overly Permissive Mocks (Leading to Undetected Vulnerabilities)](./threats/threat_security_bypass_via_overly_permissive_mocks__leading_to_undetected_vulnerabilities_.md)

**Threat:**  Security Bypass via Overly Permissive Mocks (Leading to Undetected Vulnerabilities)

*   **Description:** An attacker, potentially an insider with development access, might intentionally or unintentionally create overly permissive mocks during testing. These mocks could bypass authentication (e.g., always returning a valid user object), authorization (e.g., always granting access), or input validation (e.g., always accepting any input).  While the mocks themselves are *not* deployed, the flawed *logic* they enable in the application code *might be*. The attacker's goal is to introduce vulnerabilities that are not detected during testing due to the permissive mocks, allowing those vulnerabilities to exist in production. This is a *direct* consequence of how `mockery` is used.
*   **Impact:** High. Although the mocks are not directly in production, they mask vulnerabilities that *are* present in the production code. This can lead to security breaches if the underlying vulnerabilities are exploited. The permissive mocks create a false sense of security.
*   **Affected Mockery Component:** `mockery.Mock()` and `mockery.Expectation` configurations. Specifically, the use of `Return()` or `Run()` with values or logic that bypass security checks. For example, `mock.Expect("Authenticate").Return(true)` without any actual authentication logic being tested. The *misuse* of these `mockery` features is the problem.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Mocks:** Mocks should only return the *minimum* necessary data or behavior required for the specific test case. Avoid "god mocks" that handle everything and bypass security checks.
    *   **Negative Testing:** Implement negative test cases that *specifically* test security controls, even with mocks. For example, mock a *failed* authentication attempt and verify the expected error handling and access denial. This forces the real security logic to be exercised.
    *   **Partial Mocks/Spies:** Use partial mocks or spies (if supported by `mockery` or a related library) to allow *real* code to execute except for specific, well-defined parts. This ensures that most of the code, *including security checks*, is actually executed and tested.
    *   **Code Review Focus on Mock Logic:** Code reviews should *specifically* scrutinize mock configurations to ensure they are not overly permissive and that security checks are adequately tested. Reviewers should be trained to identify this pattern.
    *   **Regular Mock Review:** Periodically review and update mock configurations to reflect changes in the production code's security logic and to ensure they remain relevant and secure. This is an ongoing maintenance task.
