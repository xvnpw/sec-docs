        *   **Description:** Modifying mock definitions to return unexpected values or trigger specific code paths.
        *   **Return Malicious Data (High-Risk):**
            *   **Description:** Configuring a mock to return crafted data (e.g., serialized objects, large strings, format strings) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application logic.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low

        *   **Craft Payload to Exploit Vulnerability (High-Risk):**
            *   **Description:** The final step in the "Return Malicious Data" path, where the crafted data triggers a vulnerability in the application.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependent on the existence of a vulnerability)
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding the vulnerability)
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **1.a.ii. Inject Malicious Code (Critical Node):**
        *   **Description:** Using `andReturnUsing()` or similar methods to execute arbitrary PHP code within the mock.
        *   **Call Arbitrary Functions:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses the closure to execute system commands or other dangerous functions.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low

*   **1.b. Influence Test Execution (High-Risk):**
    *    **Bypass Security Checks (High-Risk):**
        *   **Description:** Using mocks to bypass authentication, authorization, or other security mechanisms during testing.
        *   **Disable Authentication (High-Risk):**
            *   **Description:** Mocking an authentication service to always return "true," masking authentication vulnerabilities.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Very Low

        *   **Return Fake Success (High-Risk):**
            *   **Description:** Mocking database interactions or other operations to always return success, hiding potential errors or vulnerabilities.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
