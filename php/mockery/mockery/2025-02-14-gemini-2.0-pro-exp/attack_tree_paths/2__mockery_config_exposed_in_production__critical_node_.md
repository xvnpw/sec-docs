# Deep Analysis of Mockery Attack Tree Path

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the security risks associated with the potential exposure and misuse of the Mockery library in a production environment.  We will focus on the specific attack tree path related to "Mockery Config Exposed in Production" and its sub-nodes.  The goal is to identify practical attack vectors, assess their feasibility, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform development practices and security controls to prevent exploitation.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the following attack tree path:

*   **2. Mockery Config Exposed in Production (Critical Node)**
    *   **2.a. Mockery Config Files Accessible (Critical Node)**
        *   **2.a.i. Direct File Access (Critical Node)**
        *   **2.a.ii. Environment Variable Leak (Critical Node)**
    *   **2.b. Mockery Loaded in Production (Critical Node)**
        *   **2.b.i. Unintended Mock Activation (Critical Node)**
        *   **2.b.ii. Hijack Mocked Dependencies (Critical Node)**

We will *not* analyze other potential attack vectors against the application outside the context of Mockery misuse.  We assume the application uses Mockery for testing purposes.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  For each node in the attack tree path, we will describe realistic attack scenarios.  We'll consider the attacker's motivations, capabilities, and potential entry points.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will analyze how the application's architecture and configuration might contribute to the vulnerability.  This includes examining code, deployment practices, and server configurations.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** We will detail the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  For each identified vulnerability, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies.  These will include preventative measures, detective controls, and incident response considerations.
5.  **Likelihood Reassessment:** After proposing mitigations, we will reassess the likelihood of each attack vector, considering the effectiveness of the proposed controls.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 2. Mockery Config Exposed in Production (Critical Node)

**Overall Description:** This is the root node of our concern.  Mockery, a testing tool, should *never* be exposed or active in a production environment.  Its presence indicates a significant configuration error.

**Threat Modeling:** An attacker's primary motivation here is to manipulate the application's behavior.  By controlling mocks, they can bypass security checks, inject malicious data, or cause denial of service.

**Impact Assessment:**  Critical.  Complete application compromise is possible.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Ensure Mockery is listed as a `dev` dependency (e.g., in `composer.json` for PHP, `package.json` for Node.js, `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for Python).  Production builds should *exclude* dev dependencies.
    *   **Build Process Verification:**  Implement checks in the CI/CD pipeline to verify that Mockery is *not* included in production builds.  This could involve analyzing the build artifacts or using dependency analysis tools.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews should explicitly check for any code that might load or configure Mockery outside of testing contexts.
    *   **Environment Segregation:**  Strictly separate development, testing, staging, and production environments.  Ensure configurations are environment-specific and cannot be accidentally mixed.

*   **Detective:**
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Configure rules to detect attempts to access known Mockery configuration files or directories.
    *   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit server configurations and deployed code to identify any traces of Mockery.

*   **Incident Response:**
    *   **Plan for Compromise:**  Assume that Mockery exposure *could* lead to a full compromise.  Have a plan in place to isolate the affected system, investigate the extent of the breach, and restore from backups.

**Likelihood Reassessment:** After implementing these mitigations, the likelihood should be reduced to **Negligible**.

#### 2.a. Mockery Config Files Accessible (Critical Node)

**Description:** Mockery configuration files (e.g., `.mockery.yaml`, or files specified via `--config`) are deployed to the production server and are accessible via the web server.

**Threat Modeling:** An attacker could discover these files through directory listing, vulnerability scanning, or by guessing common file names.

**Impact Assessment:** Critical.  The attacker can directly modify the mocking behavior, potentially leading to complete control over mocked dependencies.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Web Server Configuration:**  Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to *deny* access to any files or directories related to Mockery configuration.  Use `.htaccess` files (Apache) or server configuration blocks (Nginx) to block access.
    *   **File System Permissions:**  Ensure that the web server user has the *minimum necessary* permissions.  It should *not* have write access to any configuration files, and ideally, should not have read access to Mockery configuration files.
    *   **Deployment Process:**  The deployment process should *never* copy Mockery configuration files to the production server.

*   **Detective:**
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Configure the WAF to block requests to known Mockery configuration file paths.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use FIM tools to monitor for any changes to configuration files or the creation of unexpected files.

**Likelihood Reassessment:** After implementing these mitigations, the likelihood should be reduced to **Very Low**.

##### 2.a.i. Direct File Access (Critical Node)

**Description:** The attacker gains direct access to the server (e.g., through SSH, RDP, or a compromised account) and can modify the Mockery configuration files.

**Likelihood:** Very Low (as stated in the original tree, but we'll analyze it).

**Threat Modeling:** This requires a significant prior compromise, such as obtaining valid credentials or exploiting a separate vulnerability to gain shell access.

**Impact Assessment:** Very High.  Full control over Mockery configuration allows for arbitrary code execution through manipulated mocks.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all server access.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid using root or administrator accounts for routine tasks.
    *   **Regular Security Updates:**  Keep the operating system and all software up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the production server from less secure networks.
    *   **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Deploy an IPS to detect and block malicious activity.

*   **Detective:**
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Collect and analyze logs from various sources to detect suspicious activity.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Monitor critical system files and configuration files for unauthorized changes.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

**Likelihood Reassessment:** While the initial likelihood is Very Low, strong security practices are essential.  With mitigations, the likelihood remains **Very Low**, but the focus shifts to preventing the initial compromise that would enable this attack.

##### 2.a.ii. Environment Variable Leak (Critical Node)

**Description:** Mockery's behavior can be controlled by environment variables.  If these variables are exposed (e.g., through a misconfigured web server, a vulnerable application endpoint, or a compromised server), an attacker can influence Mockery's behavior.

**Likelihood:** Low (as stated in the original tree).

**Threat Modeling:** An attacker might exploit a vulnerability that leaks environment variables, such as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability or a misconfigured debugging endpoint.

**Impact Assessment:** Very High.  Controlling environment variables related to Mockery can allow an attacker to enable mocking in production and potentially control which classes are mocked.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Store sensitive environment variables securely (e.g., using a secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault).  *Never* hardcode secrets in the application code or configuration files.
    *   **Web Server Hardening:**  Configure the web server to prevent the leakage of environment variables.  Disable unnecessary features and modules.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user input to prevent attacks like SSRF that could be used to leak environment variables.
    *   **Code Review:**  Review code for any potential vulnerabilities that could expose environment variables.

*   **Detective:**
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Configure the WAF to block requests that attempt to access sensitive information, including environment variables.
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Monitor logs for any unusual requests or errors that might indicate an attempt to leak environment variables.

**Likelihood Reassessment:** With proper secure configuration management and vulnerability mitigation, the likelihood should be reduced to **Very Low**.

#### 2.b. Mockery Loaded in Production (Critical Node)

**Description:** The `mockery` library itself is present in the production environment's dependencies.

**Threat Modeling:** Even if configuration files are inaccessible, the mere presence of the library creates a risk if the application logic can be manipulated to use it.

**Impact Assessment:** High to Critical, depending on how the library is (mis)used.

**Mitigation Strategies:** This is largely addressed by the mitigations for node **2. Mockery Config Exposed in Production**, specifically the **Dependency Management** and **Build Process Verification** steps.  The core mitigation is to *prevent* Mockery from being included in the production build.

**Likelihood Reassessment:**  Should be **Negligible** if proper dependency management is in place.

##### 2.b.i. Unintended Mock Activation (Critical Node)

**Description:** The application's code contains logic that, under certain conditions, activates Mockery and uses mocked objects in production. This is likely due to a coding error or a misunderstanding of how Mockery should be used.

**Likelihood:** Low (as stated).

**Threat Modeling:** This typically happens if conditional logic intended to enable mocks only during testing is flawed, or if a developer accidentally leaves mocking code enabled.

**Impact Assessment:** High.  Mocked objects might return unexpected values, bypass security checks, or cause application instability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Thorough code reviews should specifically look for any code that might activate Mockery outside of a testing context.
    *   **Testing:**  Comprehensive testing (including integration and end-to-end tests) should be performed to ensure that mocks are *not* used in production scenarios.  This includes negative testing to verify that expected errors are handled correctly when mocks are *not* present.
    *   **Environment Checks:**  Implement explicit checks within the application code to verify that the application is running in a testing environment *before* initializing or using Mockery.  For example:

        ```php
        if (getenv('APP_ENV') === 'testing') {
            // Initialize Mockery
        } else {
            // Throw an exception or log an error
            throw new \Exception("Mockery should not be used in production!");
        }
        ```

*   **Detective:**
    *   **Logging:**  Implement robust logging to track the use of mocked objects.  Any instances of Mockery being used in production should be logged as critical errors.
    *   **Runtime Monitoring:**  Use application performance monitoring (APM) tools to detect unusual behavior that might indicate the use of mocked objects.

**Likelihood Reassessment:** With rigorous code reviews, testing, and environment checks, the likelihood should be reduced to **Very Low**.

##### 2.b.ii. Hijack Mocked Dependencies (Critical Node)

**Description:** An attacker, having gained some level of control (e.g., through a separate vulnerability), can influence which classes are mocked by Mockery, replacing legitimate dependencies with malicious implementations.

**Likelihood:** Very Low (as stated).

**Threat Modeling:** This requires a significant prior compromise, such as the ability to modify code, configuration files, or environment variables.  It's a sophisticated attack.

**Impact Assessment:** Very High.  The attacker can completely control the behavior of mocked dependencies, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**  The mitigations for this scenario are largely the same as those for **2.a.i. Direct File Access** and **2.a.ii. Environment Variable Leak**.  Preventing unauthorized access to the server and configuration is paramount.
    *   **Code Signing:**  Consider code signing to ensure the integrity of the application code.
    *   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  RASP tools can detect and prevent attempts to tamper with the application's runtime behavior.

*   **Detective:**
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Monitor for changes to application code and configuration files.
    *   **Runtime Monitoring:**  Use APM tools to detect unusual behavior that might indicate the hijacking of mocked dependencies.

**Likelihood Reassessment:**  The likelihood remains **Very Low** due to the complexity of the attack and the required prior compromise.  The focus should be on preventing the initial compromise that would enable this attack.

## 5. Conclusion

The use of Mockery in a production environment presents significant security risks.  The most effective mitigation strategy is to *prevent* Mockery from being deployed to production in the first place.  This requires careful dependency management, build process verification, and secure configuration practices.  By implementing the mitigations outlined in this analysis, the likelihood of a successful attack exploiting Mockery can be significantly reduced.  Regular security audits and ongoing vigilance are crucial to maintaining a secure production environment.
