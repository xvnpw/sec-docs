# Attack Surface Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Attack Surface: [1. Overly Permissive Mocks (Bypassing Security Checks)](./attack_surfaces/1__overly_permissive_mocks__bypassing_security_checks_.md)

*   **Description:** Mocks are defined to bypass security checks or critical validation logic, creating a "testing backdoor" that wouldn't exist in the real object.
*   **How Mockery Contributes:** Mockery provides the core functionality to create mocks that can return *any* value or exhibit *any* behavior, making it easy to accidentally (or intentionally) create overly permissive mocks that bypass security.
*   **Example:**
    ```php
    // Mock (Vulnerable)
    $mockAuth = Mockery::mock(AuthService::class);
    $mockAuth->shouldReceive('isAuthenticated')->andReturn(true); // Always authenticated!
    ```
*   **Impact:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities that would normally be prevented by the real object's logic, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Specific Expectations:** Use `shouldReceive()->with(...)` to define *precise* expected arguments. The mock should only respond to valid inputs.
    *   **Controlled Return Values:** Use `andReturn()` or `andReturnUsing()` to carefully control return values, mirroring the real object's behavior, including error handling.
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require code reviews of test code, specifically focusing on mock definitions. Reviewers must check for overly permissive mocks.
    *   **Test Negative Cases:** Include tests that verify the mock *correctly rejects* invalid inputs, just like the real object would.

## Attack Surface: [2. Mocking Security-Sensitive Components Directly](./attack_surfaces/2__mocking_security-sensitive_components_directly.md)

*   **Description:** Directly mocking classes/methods responsible for authentication, authorization, encryption, etc. Errors in these mocks create significant vulnerabilities.
*   **How Mockery Contributes:** Mockery allows mocking of *any* class or method, including those handling sensitive operations. This capability, if misused, is the direct source of the risk.
*   **Example:**
    ```php
    // Mock (Vulnerable)
    $mockHasher = Mockery::mock(PasswordHasher::class);
    $mockHasher->shouldReceive('hashPassword')->andReturn('weak_hash'); // Always returns a weak, predictable hash!
    ```
*   **Impact:** Bypassing core security mechanisms (authentication, authorization, data protection), potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize Integration Tests:** Favor integration tests that use the *real* implementations of security-critical components over unit tests with mocks.
    *   **Extreme Caution with Mocks:** If mocking is absolutely necessary, the mock's behavior must *perfectly* replicate the security constraints of the real object.
    *   **Consider Stubs/Spies:** Use stubs or spies to verify interactions with security methods, rather than replacing their entire logic with a mock.
    *   **Dedicated Security Tests:** Create separate tests specifically for security aspects, using real implementations whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unintended Side Effects in Mocked Method Logic](./attack_surfaces/3__unintended_side_effects_in_mocked_method_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Using `andReturnUsing()` with closures that have unintended side effects (e.g., logging sensitive data) or contain vulnerabilities themselves.
*   **How Mockery Contributes:** Mockery's `andReturnUsing()` feature *directly* enables the use of custom closures to define mock behavior. This flexibility is the source of the potential risk.
*   **Example:**
    ```php
    $mock = Mockery::mock(SomeClass::class);
    $mock->shouldReceive('someMethod')->andReturnUsing(function ($input) {
        error_log("Input: " . $input); // Vulnerable: Logs potentially sensitive data!
        return true;
    });
    ```
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, unintended state changes, or potentially even execution of malicious code if the closure is compromised.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Simple Closures:** Keep closures used with `andReturnUsing()` as simple and focused as possible. Avoid complex logic.
    *   **No Side Effects:** Closures should *only* return values and not have any side effects (no logging, database interactions, etc.).
    *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review the code within these closures for potential security issues.
    *   **Input Validation:** If the closure processes input, ensure it performs proper input validation and sanitization.
