# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mockery/mockery

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Mocking Scope (Principle of Least Privilege for Mocks)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_mocking_scope__principle_of_least_privilege_for_mocks_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify the Unit Under Test (UUT):** Clearly define the specific class or function being tested.
2.  **Identify Direct Dependencies:** List only the *immediate* collaborators of the UUT.  These are the classes or functions that the UUT directly interacts with (calls methods on).
3.  **Mock Only Direct Dependencies:** Create `mockery` mocks *exclusively* for these direct dependencies.  Do *not* use `mockery` to mock anything further down the dependency chain.
4.  **Refactor if Necessary:** If the UUT has too many direct dependencies, consider refactoring to reduce coupling. This makes mocking with `mockery` simpler and less error-prone.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Overly Permissive Mocking (High Severity):** Directly addresses this by limiting the scope of what `mockery` is used to mock.
*   **Incomplete Mocking (Medium Severity):** By focusing on direct dependencies, it's easier to ensure that all relevant interactions are mocked using `mockery`.

**Impact:**
*   **Overly Permissive Mocking:** Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Incomplete Mocking:** Moderately reduces risk.

**Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Partially implemented; some tests mock too deeply."]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Need to refactor `ReportGeneratorTest` to mock only direct dependencies."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prefer Partial Mocks/Spies Sparingly](./mitigation_strategies/prefer_partial_mocksspies_sparingly.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Need:** Determine *why* a `mockery` partial mock (using `mock('MyClass[methodToMock]')`) or spy (using `spy('MyClass')`) is being considered.
2.  **Explore Alternatives:** Before using a partial mock/spy, consider refactoring to make the behavior directly observable without needing to mock internal methods.
3.  **If Necessary, Use with Caution:** If a `mockery` partial mock or spy is *unavoidable*, use it sparingly, document its purpose clearly, and ensure it's thoroughly reviewed.  Minimize the number of methods mocked on a real object.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unexpected Side Effects (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unforeseen consequences from interactions between mocked and real code within the same object when using `mockery`'s partial mocking capabilities.
*   **State Manipulation Issues (Medium Severity):** Limits the manipulation of real object state via `mockery`, reducing the chance of hiding state-related bugs.

**Impact:**
*   **Unexpected Side Effects:** Moderately reduces risk.
*   **State Manipulation Issues:** Moderately reduces risk.

**Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "No explicit policy; usage is inconsistent."]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Need a guideline discouraging partial mocks and requiring justification."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Never Mock Security-Critical Components Directly](./mitigation_strategies/never_mock_security-critical_components_directly.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Security Components:** Create a list of all security-related classes, functions, and libraries.
2.  **Strict Policy:** Implement a clear policy *prohibiting* the use of `mockery` to mock these components directly in *any* tests.
3.  **Use Real Implementations:** In tests requiring security checks, use the *real* security components, not `mockery` mocks.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Mocking Internal Security Mechanisms (Critical Severity):** Directly prevents bypassing security checks by forbidding the use of `mockery` on these components.

**Impact:**
*   **Mocking Internal Security Mechanisms:** Eliminates the risk within the context of `mockery` usage.

**Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Policy documented, but not enforced via tooling."]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Need a pre-commit hook to detect mocking of security classes."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Mock Configurations (Configuration as Code)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_mock_configurations__configuration_as_code_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Treat Mocks as Code:** Recognize that `mockery` configurations are part of the codebase.
2.  **Code Reviews:** Include `mockery` mock configurations in code reviews. Reviewers should specifically check:
    *   **Correct `shouldReceive()` Calls:** Verify that the mocked methods are correct.
    *   **Accurate `with()` Constraints:** Ensure arguments passed to `with()` match expected arguments.
    *   **Realistic Return Values:** Check that `andReturn()` values are realistic and cover different scenarios.
    *   **Proper Exception Handling:** If the real code throws exceptions, ensure the `mockery` mock uses `andThrow()` correctly.
3. **Consider automated linters:** If possible, use or create linters that can check for common issues in mockery configurations.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Incomplete Mocking (Medium Severity):** Helps ensure all relevant interactions are mocked correctly using `mockery`.
*   **Overly Permissive Mocking (Medium Severity):** Reduces incorrect `mockery` configurations that mask real behavior.
*   **Unexpected Side Effects (Low Severity):** Can help identify `mockery` mocks that don't account for side effects.

**Impact:**
*   **Incomplete Mocking:** Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Overly Permissive Mocking:** Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Unexpected Side Effects:** Slightly reduces risk.

**Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Reviewed as part of general code reviews, but no specific focus."]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Add specific guidelines for reviewing `mockery` configurations to the checklist."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Mockery's Features Safely](./mitigation_strategies/use_mockery's_features_safely.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Understand Mockery's API:** Thoroughly read and understand the `mockery` documentation.
2.  **`expects()` vs. `allows()`:** Use `expects()` when a method call *must* happen. Use `allows()` for optional calls.  This is a core `mockery` distinction.
3.  **`with()` Constraints:** Use `with()` to specify expected arguments. Be as specific as possible. Use `mockery`'s argument matchers (e.g., `\Mockery::any()`, `\Mockery::type()`) judiciously.
4.  **Return Value Control:** Use `andReturn()`, `andReturnUsing()`, and `andThrow()` appropriately to control the behavior of mocked methods, as defined by `mockery`.
5.  **Verification:** Use `Mockery::close()` at the end of each test to ensure that all `mockery` expectations were met. This is a crucial `mockery`-specific step.
6. **Understand Mockery's limitations:** Know what Mockery can and cannot mock (e.g., final classes/methods without workarounds).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Incomplete Mocking (Medium Severity):** Using `expects()` and `with()` correctly with `mockery` helps ensure verification.
*   **Overly Permissive Mocking (Medium Severity):** Using specific `mockery` argument matchers and return value control prevents overly lenient mocks.
*   **Unexpected Side Effects (Low Severity):** Proper use of `andThrow()` and return value control in `mockery` helps simulate side effects.

**Impact:**
*   **Incomplete Mocking:** Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Overly Permissive Mocking:** Moderately reduces risk.
*   **Unexpected Side Effects:** Slightly reduces risk.

**Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Developers use `mockery`, but advanced features are underutilized."]*

**Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Need guidance on using argument matchers and `andReturnUsing()`."]*
