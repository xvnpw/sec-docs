# Threat Model Analysis for bcit-ci/codeigniter

## Threat: [Unprotected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Output](./threats/unprotected_cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unescaped_output.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. This is done by exploiting areas where user-provided data or data from the database is displayed without proper encoding or sanitization, specifically by failing to use CodeIgniter's output escaping mechanisms.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, information theft (including cookies and sensitive data), defacement of the website, and potentially executing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Affected Component:** Views and the Output class responsible for rendering data in templates. Specifically, when variables are directly outputted without using CodeIgniter's `esc()` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use CodeIgniter's output escaping functions (`esc()`) when displaying dynamic data in views. Choose the appropriate escaping context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL, etc.).
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Improper Query Construction](./threats/sql_injection_via_improper_query_construction.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates SQL queries executed by the application by injecting malicious SQL code through user-supplied input. This occurs when developers construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user input without proper sanitization or by not utilizing CodeIgniter's query builder correctly, thus bypassing its built-in protections.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, data breach (reading sensitive information), data manipulation (inserting, updating, or deleting data), and potentially gaining control over the database server.

**Affected Component:** The Database library, specifically when using raw queries or improperly using the query builder without proper binding or escaping provided by CodeIgniter.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Primarily use CodeIgniter's Active Record features and Query Builder with parameterized queries (using `bind_param()` or `?` placeholders) to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code.
*   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries by concatenating user input. If absolutely necessary, use CodeIgniter's database escaping functions (`$this->db->escape()`) meticulously.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting malicious requests on the web application. This is possible if the developer hasn't enabled or correctly implemented CodeIgniter's built-in CSRF protection. The browser automatically sends the user's session cookies with the forged request, making it appear legitimate to the CodeIgniter application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or transferring funds.

**Affected Component:** The Security helper and the form handling mechanisms provided by CodeIgniter. Specifically, the lack of proper CSRF token generation and validation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable CodeIgniter's built-in CSRF protection by setting the `$config['csrf_protection']` to `TRUE` in the `config.php` file.
*   Ensure the CSRF token is included in all forms (using the `form_open()` helper or manually adding the hidden field provided by CodeIgniter).
*   For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers or data.

## Threat: [Insecure File Uploads](./threats/insecure_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files to the server, which can then be executed or used for other malicious purposes. This occurs when the application doesn't properly utilize CodeIgniter's Upload library for validation or bypasses it with custom, insecure implementations.

**Impact:** Remote code execution (if executable files are uploaded and accessed), defacement of the website, serving malware to other users, and potential compromise of the server.

**Affected Component:** The Upload library and any custom file handling logic that doesn't properly leverage CodeIgniter's features.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use CodeIgniter's Upload library for handling file uploads.
*   Validate file types based on their content (magic numbers) and not just the file extension.
*   Restrict file sizes to reasonable limits.
*   Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable filenames and potential overwriting of existing files.
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot to prevent direct execution.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in URLs or Forms](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_urls_or_forms.md)

**Description:** An attacker directly manipulates object identifiers (e.g., database IDs) in URLs or form parameters to access resources belonging to other users without proper authorization checks. This is a vulnerability in the application logic, but can be exacerbated by how CodeIgniter routes and handles requests if not implemented securely.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data belonging to other users.

**Affected Component:** Controllers and models that handle data retrieval and manipulation based on user-provided IDs, often in conjunction with CodeIgniter's routing mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement proper authorization checks within CodeIgniter controllers to verify that the current user has permission to access the requested resource based on the provided identifier.
*   Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in URLs or forms. Use unique, non-sequential, and unpredictable identifiers (UUIDs or hashes).
