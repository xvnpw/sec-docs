# Attack Tree Analysis for bcit-ci/codeigniter

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access and control over the application's data and functionality by exploiting weaknesses within the CodeIgniter framework.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise CodeIgniter Application
* Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Expose Sensitive Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Access config.php (e.g., database credentials, encryption key) [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Access database.php (database credentials) [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Access .env file (if used with a library) [CRITICAL NODE]
* Exploit Libraries and Helpers [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Vulnerabilities in Built-in Libraries [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries (used with CodeIgniter) [CRITICAL NODE]
* Exploit Error Handling and Debugging [HIGH RISK PATH]
    * Information Disclosure via Error Messages [CRITICAL NODE]
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

This path represents the risk of attackers gaining access to sensitive configuration files, which is a common and high-impact vulnerability in web applications, including those built with CodeIgniter.

* **Expose Sensitive Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Success here grants immediate access to critical application secrets.
    * **Attack Vector:** Web server misconfiguration (e.g., incorrect access permissions, directory listing enabled).
    * **Attack Vector:**  Failure to move configuration files outside the web root.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting other vulnerabilities (e.g., Local File Inclusion - LFI) to read configuration files.
    * **Access config.php (e.g., database credentials, encryption key) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Impact:** Full database access, ability to decrypt sensitive data, potential for complete application takeover.
    * **Access database.php (database credentials) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Impact:** Full database access, ability to read, modify, or delete data.
    * **Access .env file (if used with a library) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Impact:** Exposure of various environment variables, including API keys, service credentials, and potentially database details if not duplicated in `database.php`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Libraries and Helpers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_libraries_and_helpers.md)

This path highlights the risks associated with vulnerabilities in the CodeIgniter framework itself or in third-party libraries used within the application. These are often well-documented and easily exploitable.

* **Vulnerabilities in Built-in Libraries [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Using an outdated version of CodeIgniter with known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in its core libraries.
    * **Impact:** Can range from remote code execution to denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
* **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries (used with CodeIgniter) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Using vulnerable versions of third-party libraries integrated into the CodeIgniter application (e.g., via Composer).
    * **Impact:** Highly variable depending on the vulnerable library and its function. Could lead to remote code execution, SQL injection, or other significant compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Error Handling and Debugging](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_error_handling_and_debugging.md)

This path focuses on the risks of leaving debugging features enabled in production environments, leading to information disclosure.

* **Information Disclosure via Error Messages [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Debug mode enabled in the production `index.php` or environment configuration.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Poorly configured custom error handling that reveals sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information such as file paths, database connection details, internal application logic, and potentially secrets used in the application. This information can be used to further other attacks.
