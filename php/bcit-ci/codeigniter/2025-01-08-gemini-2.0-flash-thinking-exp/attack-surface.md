# Attack Surface Analysis for bcit-ci/codeigniter

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into web pages through user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized or escaped before being displayed.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** CodeIgniter provides input handling methods (`$this->input->get()`, `$this->input->post()`, etc.). If developers directly output this data in views without using CodeIgniter's output encoding functions (like `esc()`), XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** A comment form where the user's name is displayed without encoding:
        *   Controller: `$name = $this->input->post('name');`
        *   View: `<h1>Welcome, <?php echo $name; ?></h1>`
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use CodeIgniter's Output Encoding:** Employ functions like `esc()` (with the appropriate context, e.g., 'html') when displaying user-generated content in views. Example: `<h1>Welcome, <?php echo esc($name); ?></h1>`
        *   **Context-Specific Encoding:** Understand the context where data is being displayed (HTML, JavaScript, URL) and use the appropriate encoding method.

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input leading to SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_leading_to_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries through user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized or parameterized.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** While CodeIgniter's Query Builder offers protection, developers might still write raw SQL queries using `$this->db->query()` or misuse the Query Builder. Directly concatenating user input obtained via CodeIgniter's input methods into SQL queries is a major risk.
    *   **Example:** A search functionality using direct SQL:
        *   Controller: `$keyword = $this->input->get('keyword');`
        *   Model: `$sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%" . $keyword . "%'";`
                 `$query = $this->db->query($sql);`
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always Use CodeIgniter's Query Builder:** The Query Builder automatically escapes values, preventing SQL injection. Example:
            `$keyword = $this->input->get('keyword');`
            `$this->db->like('name', $keyword);`
            `$query = $this->db->get('products');`
        *   **Use Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:** If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, use prepared statements with bound parameters. CodeIgniter's Query Builder handles this internally.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate user input to ensure it conforms to the expected data type and format, reducing the possibility of malicious input.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how user sessions are created, maintained, and destroyed can allow attackers to hijack or manipulate sessions.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** CodeIgniter provides a session library. Insecure default configurations or improper usage of the session library can lead to vulnerabilities. For instance, not enforcing HTTPS for session cookies or using weak session identifiers.
    *   **Example:** Using default session configurations without HTTPS:
        *   Session cookies are transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection, allowing attackers to intercept them.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can impersonate legitimate users, gaining access to their accounts and data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configure Sessions Securely:**
            *   **Use HTTPS:** Ensure the application is served over HTTPS to encrypt session cookies. Configure `$config['cookie_secure'] = TRUE;` in `config.php`.
            *   **Enable `httponly` Flag:** Set `$config['cookie_httponly'] = TRUE;` to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing session cookies, mitigating some XSS attacks.
            *   **Regenerate Session IDs Regularly:** Use `$this->session->regenerate(TRUE);` to change the session ID after login or other sensitive actions.
            *   **Set Appropriate Session Lifetime:** Configure a reasonable session timeout to limit the window of opportunity for session hijacking.
            *   **Consider Using Database or Redis for Session Storage:** This can provide better security and scalability compared to file-based sessions.
        *   **Protect Against Session Fixation:** Regenerate the session ID upon successful login.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the application handles file uploads can allow attackers to upload malicious files.
    *   **How CodeIgniter Contributes:** CodeIgniter provides a file upload library. Improper configuration or lack of validation when using this library can lead to vulnerabilities, such as allowing the upload of executable files or not sanitizing filenames.
    *   **Example:** Allowing uploads without proper file type validation:
        *   An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image.
        *   If the server executes PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can upload malware, gain remote code execution on the server, or cause denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Validate File Types:** Restrict allowed file types based on their actual content (using MIME type checks) and not just the file extension. CodeIgniter's upload library provides options for this.
        *   **Sanitize Filenames:** Rename uploaded files to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities and execution of scripts.
        *   **Store Uploads Outside the Webroot:** Store uploaded files in a directory that is not directly accessible via the web server. Access them through a controller that enforces access controls.
        *   **Limit File Size:** Prevent excessively large uploads that could lead to denial of service.
        *   **Disable Script Execution in Upload Directories:** Configure the web server to prevent the execution of scripts in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` or server configuration).
