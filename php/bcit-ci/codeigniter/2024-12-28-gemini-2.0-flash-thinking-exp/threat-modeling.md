### High and Critical CodeIgniter Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** Improper use of Query Builder leading to SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by manipulating user input, which is then executed by the application's database *through CodeIgniter's Database Library*. This can allow the attacker to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. This occurs when developers use raw queries or don't properly utilize Query Builder's features for escaping and parameter binding.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
        *   Data breach (access to sensitive user data, financial information, etc.)
        *   Data manipulation (modification or deletion of data)
        *   Complete compromise of the database
    *   **Affected CodeIgniter Component:**
        *   Database Library (`$this->db`) - specifically when using raw queries or not properly using Query Builder's features.
        *   Active Record methods - if used incorrectly or with insufficient input sanitization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use CodeIgniter's Query Builder with parameter binding for database interactions.
        *   Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user input.
        *   If raw queries are absolutely necessary, use prepared statements with proper parameterization.
        *   Enforce least privilege for database user accounts.

*   **Threat:** Disabled or Misconfigured CSRF Protection
    *   **Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the web application. This is possible because *CodeIgniter's built-in CSRF protection mechanism* is either disabled or not configured correctly. This means the application cannot effectively distinguish between legitimate requests and those initiated by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:** High
        *   Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user (e.g., changing passwords, making purchases).
        *   Data manipulation.
        *   Account takeover.
    *   **Affected CodeIgniter Component:**
        *   Security Library (`$this->security`) - specifically the CSRF protection feature.
        *   Form Helper - when generating forms without including CSRF tokens *as facilitated by CodeIgniter*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in `config.php`.
        *   Use CodeIgniter's form helper to automatically include CSRF tokens in forms.
        *   For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers or body *as required by CodeIgniter's CSRF implementation*.
        *   Consider using the `CSRF_REGENERATE` option for enhanced security.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Session Management
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's session, allowing them to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf. This can happen due to weaknesses in *how CodeIgniter manages sessions*, such as weak session IDs generated by the framework, insecure default storage, or lack of proper configuration for security flags.
    *   **Impact:** High
        *   Account takeover.
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
        *   Malicious actions performed under the user's identity.
    *   **Affected CodeIgniter Component:**
        *   Session Library (`$this->session`).
        *   Configuration files (`config.php`) - related to session settings *within the CodeIgniter framework*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure session storage mechanisms (e.g., database, Redis) *supported by CodeIgniter*.
        *   Configure strong session IDs *using CodeIgniter's configuration options*.
        *   Set appropriate session timeouts *within CodeIgniter's session configuration*.
        *   Enforce the use of HTTPS to protect session cookies *which is a general best practice, but crucial for CodeIgniter sessions*.
        *   Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies *through CodeIgniter's configuration*.
        *   Regenerate session IDs after successful login and other sensitive actions *using CodeIgniter's session methods*.
        *   Destroy sessions upon logout.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Configuration of Encryption Keys
    *   **Description:** CodeIgniter uses encryption for various purposes, such as session management and data encryption *through its Encryption Library*. If the encryption key configured within CodeIgniter is weak, default, or exposed, attackers can decrypt sensitive data or forge encrypted data.
    *   **Impact:** High
        *   Decryption of sensitive data (e.g., session data, encrypted user information).
        *   Ability to forge encrypted data, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected CodeIgniter Component:**
        *   Encryption Library (`$this->encryption`).
        *   Configuration files (`config.php`) - where the encryption key is defined *for CodeIgniter's encryption*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate a strong, unique encryption key for the application.
        *   Store the encryption key securely and avoid committing it directly to version control.
        *   Consider using environment variables to manage sensitive configuration values.
        *   Regularly rotate encryption keys.
