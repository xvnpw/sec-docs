**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

**Critical Nodes:**

*   **Bypass Access Controls via Default Routes:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and access administrative or sensitive functionalities through default, unprotected routes defined by CodeIgniter or the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Gaining unauthorized access to administrative features can lead to full application compromise, data manipulation, and user account takeover.

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Database Abstraction Layer:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit logic flaws or improper usage of CodeIgniter's database abstraction layer to inject malicious SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to full database compromise, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.

*   **Unrestricted File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) to the server due to insufficient validation of file types and content.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful upload and execution of malicious files can grant attackers complete control over the server, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, or steal data.

*   **Exposure of Database Credentials:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to database credentials stored insecurely in configuration files, environment variables, or other accessible locations.
    *   **Impact:**  With database credentials, attackers can directly access and manipulate the database, leading to data breaches, data corruption, and service disruption.

**High-Risk Paths:**

*   **Leverage Developer Mistakes or Misconfigurations -> Insecure Use of CodeIgniter Features -> Improper Handling of User Input:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers fail to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied data when using CodeIgniter's input handling mechanisms. This can lead to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
        *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL queries into database interactions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.

*   **Exploit CodeIgniter Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Insecure File Handling -> Unrestricted File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the application's file upload functionality, bypassing any intended restrictions to upload and execute malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  As described above, successful remote code execution grants attackers full control over the server.

*   **Exploit CodeIgniter Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Insecure Configuration -> Exposure of Database Credentials:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in the CodeIgniter application, such as publicly accessible configuration files or insecure storage of environment variables, to retrieve database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** As described above, access to database credentials allows for full database compromise.

*   **Exploit CodeIgniter Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Insecure Session Management -> Session Fixation:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate a user's session ID to force them to use a known session ID. If the application doesn't regenerate session IDs after login, the attacker can then hijack the user's session.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, allowing the attacker to perform actions as the legitimate user.

*   **Exploit CodeIgniter Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Insecure Session Management -> Session Hijacking:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers intercept or steal a legitimate user's session ID (e.g., through network sniffing or XSS) and use it to impersonate the user.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, allowing the attacker to perform actions as the legitimate user.

*   **Exploit CodeIgniter Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploit XSS Vulnerabilities via Input Helper Misuse:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers rely solely on CodeIgniter's input helper (like `xss_clean`) for sanitization without implementing proper context-aware output encoding in views. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that are not effectively neutralized.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side attacks, including stealing session cookies (leading to session hijacking), redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
