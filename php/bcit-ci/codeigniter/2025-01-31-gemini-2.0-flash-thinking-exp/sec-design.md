# BUSINESS POSTURE

CodeIgniter is a PHP framework designed to provide a simple, lightweight, and fast environment for building web applications. It aims to empower developers to create web applications rapidly with less code compared to writing from scratch or using more complex frameworks.

- Business Priorities:
  - Rapid web application development.
  - Ease of use and developer-friendliness.
  - High performance and efficiency of web applications.
  - Broad compatibility with various hosting environments.
  - Strong community support and extensive documentation.

- Business Goals:
  - Enable developers to quickly prototype and deploy web applications.
  - Reduce development time and costs for web projects.
  - Provide a stable and reliable framework for building robust web applications.
  - Foster a large and active community of users and contributors.
  - Maintain a lightweight footprint and minimal dependencies.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in web applications built using CodeIgniter, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or reputational damage.
  - Lack of adherence to secure coding practices by developers using the framework, resulting in exploitable weaknesses.
  - Dependency on community support for security updates and patches, which might have delays or gaps.
  - Potential for misconfiguration of the framework or underlying server environment, leading to security issues.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks targeting dependencies or the framework itself.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control CSRF Protection: Built-in protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, configurable in the framework settings. Described in CodeIgniter documentation under "Security".
  - security control XSS Filtering: Built-in input filtering to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks, applied to input data. Described in CodeIgniter documentation under "Security".
  - security control Database Input Escaping: Database abstraction layer provides mechanisms to escape input data to prevent SQL injection attacks. Described in CodeIgniter documentation under "Database".
  - security control Password Hashing: Utilizes PHP's password hashing functions for secure storage of user passwords. Described in CodeIgniter documentation under "Security" and "Authentication".
  - security control Input Validation: Framework provides input validation library to validate user inputs based on defined rules. Described in CodeIgniter documentation under "Input Validation".

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk Vulnerabilities in user-developed application code: Security of applications built with CodeIgniter heavily relies on developers following secure coding practices. Vulnerabilities in application logic, custom modules, or third-party libraries are an accepted risk.
  - accepted risk Misconfiguration of server environment: Incorrectly configured web servers, databases, or PHP settings can introduce security vulnerabilities. Proper server hardening and configuration are assumed to be the responsibility of the deployment environment.
  - accepted risk Outdated dependencies: Usage of outdated versions of CodeIgniter or its dependencies can expose applications to known vulnerabilities. Maintaining up-to-date dependencies is considered a shared responsibility.
  - accepted risk Social engineering attacks targeting application users: Phishing, credential theft, and other social engineering attacks are outside the scope of the framework itself and are considered an accepted risk at the application level.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Implement SAST tools to automatically scan application code for potential security vulnerabilities during development and build processes.
  - security control Dependency Scanning: Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components used by CodeIgniter applications.
  - security control Penetration Testing: Conduct regular penetration testing by security professionals to identify and address security weaknesses in deployed applications.
  - security control Security Audits: Perform periodic security audits of application code, configuration, and infrastructure to ensure adherence to security best practices.
  - security control Security Training for Developers: Provide security training to developers to promote secure coding practices and awareness of common web application vulnerabilities.
  - security control Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF in front of web applications to provide an additional layer of security against common web attacks.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Implement secure user authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of users accessing the application.
    - Details: CodeIgniter provides session management and helpers for authentication. Applications should use strong password policies, multi-factor authentication where appropriate, and protect against brute-force attacks.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement robust authorization controls to manage user access to different parts of the application and data based on roles and permissions.
    - Details: Applications should define clear roles and permissions, enforce the principle of least privilege, and validate user authorization before granting access to resources or functionalities.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Thoroughly validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.) and ensure data integrity.
    - Details: Utilize CodeIgniter's input validation library and implement server-side validation for all user-provided data. Sanitize and escape outputs appropriately based on context.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use cryptography appropriately to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    - Details: Employ HTTPS for all communication, use strong encryption algorithms for data storage when necessary, and manage cryptographic keys securely. Utilize password hashing for storing user credentials.

- Build Process Description:
  1. Developer writes code and commits changes to a Code Repository (e.g., GitHub).
  2. Changes to the code repository trigger a Continuous Integration (CI) Server (e.g., GitHub Actions).
  3. CI Server orchestrates the Build Environment.
  4. Build Environment performs the following steps:
     - Fetches code from the Code Repository.
     - Uses a Dependency Manager (e.g., Composer) to download and manage project dependencies.
     - Runs SAST Scanner to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
     - Executes Linter to enforce code quality and style guidelines.
     - Runs Unit Tests to ensure code functionality and stability.
     - Builds Build Artifacts, such as a Docker image containing the application.
  5. Build Artifacts are pushed to a Container Registry.

- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control Code Repository Access Control: Restrict access to the code repository to authorized developers. Use branch protection and code review processes.
  - security control CI/CD Pipeline Security: Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure and configurations. Implement access controls and audit logging.
  - security control Dependency Management: Use a dependency manager to track and manage project dependencies. Implement dependency scanning to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in dependencies. Use dependency lock files to ensure consistent builds.
  - security control Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities. Fail builds on critical findings.
  - security control Code Linting: Enforce code quality and security best practices using linters.
  - security control Unit Testing: Implement comprehensive unit tests to ensure code functionality and reduce the likelihood of bugs and vulnerabilities.
  - security control Container Image Scanning: Scan container images for vulnerabilities before pushing to the container registry.
  - security control Artifact Signing: Sign build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
  - security control Secure Build Environment: Harden the build environment and minimize its attack surface. Regularly update build tools and dependencies.
