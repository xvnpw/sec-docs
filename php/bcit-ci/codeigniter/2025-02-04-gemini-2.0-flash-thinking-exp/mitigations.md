# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bcit-ci/codeigniter

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `encryption_key`](./mitigation_strategies/secure__encryption_key_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Configuration File:** Open the `config/config.php` file within your CodeIgniter application (usually in `application/config/`).
    2.  **Identify `encryption_key`:** Find the line defining the encryption key: `$config['encryption_key'] = 'your_key';` (or similar).
    3.  **Generate Strong Key:** Create a cryptographically strong, unique, and random key. Use a secure random string generator.  Avoid predictable keys.
    4.  **Replace Default Key:**  Replace the placeholder `'your_key'` with your generated strong key.
    5.  **Configuration Storage:** Ensure `config/config.php` is securely stored and not publicly accessible. Consider using environment variables for production environments to keep the key out of the codebase.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session Hijacking (High Severity): Weak `encryption_key` compromises session encryption, enabling session hijacking.
    *   Cookie Manipulation (Medium Severity):  CodeIgniter uses this key for cookie signing; a weak key allows forging signed cookies.
    *   Data Decryption (Medium Severity): If used for other encryption, a weak key risks data decryption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Hijacking: High - Significantly reduces risk by making session decryption infeasible.
    *   Cookie Manipulation: Medium - Substantially reduces cookie forgery risk.
    *   Data Decryption: Medium - Substantially reduces unauthorized data decryption risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Yes, implemented in `application/config/config.php`.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: No missing implementation. Key is rotated annually.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Remove `index.php` from URLs (CodeIgniter Routing)](./mitigation_strategies/remove__index_php__from_urls__codeigniter_routing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `config.php`:**  In `application/config/config.php`, set `$config['index_page'] = '';` (empty string). This tells CodeIgniter to expect URLs without `index.php`.
    2.  **Web Server Configuration (Apache Example):**  Use `.htaccess` in the application root with `mod_rewrite` enabled:

    ```apache
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
    </IfModule>
    ```
    (Nginx configuration will be different, consult Nginx documentation for URL rewriting).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Low Severity):  Slightly obscures framework usage by hiding `index.php`, making reconnaissance marginally harder.
    *   Obfuscation (Low Severity):  Cleaner URLs improve aesthetics and subtly reduce predictability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Low - Minimally reduces framework identification.
    *   Obfuscation: Low - Minor improvement in URL clarity and slight obfuscation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Yes, implemented using `.htaccess`.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: No missing implementation.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable `display_errors` in Production (CodeIgniter Environment)](./mitigation_strategies/disable__display_errors__in_production__codeigniter_environment_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `ENVIRONMENT`:** In your main `index.php` file, ensure `ENVIRONMENT` is set to `'production'` for live environments.
    2.  **CodeIgniter Configuration:** CodeIgniter automatically handles error display based on the `ENVIRONMENT` setting.  Verify that in `application/config/config.php` (or environment-specific config), `$config['show_error_display']` is effectively set to `FALSE` in production (this is often the default for 'production' environment).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity): Production error messages can reveal sensitive application details to attackers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Significantly reduces information leakage via error messages.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Yes, `ENVIRONMENT` is 'production' and error display is disabled.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: No missing implementation. Error logging is configured.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage CodeIgniter's Input Class for Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_codeigniter's_input_class_for_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `$this->input`:**  Consistently use CodeIgniter's Input class (`$this->input`) to access all user inputs (POST, GET, COOKIE, etc.).
    2.  **Form Validation Library:** Load CodeIgniter's Form Validation library (`$this->load->library('form_validation');`).
    3.  **Define Validation Rules:** Use `$this->form_validation->set_rules()` to define validation rules for each input field. Specify data types, required fields, constraints, etc.
    4.  **Run Validation:** Execute validation with `$this->form_validation->run()`. Handle validation failures appropriately (display errors to the user).
    5.  **Sanitize Input:** Use Input class sanitization functions like `$this->input->xss_clean()`, `$this->input->strip_tags()`, `$this->input->escape()` as needed *after* validation and *before* using or storing input. Choose sanitization appropriate for the context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity): Prevents injection by validating and sanitizing input before database queries.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity): Sanitization using `xss_clean()` and `strip_tags()` mitigates XSS risks.
    *   Command Injection (Medium Severity): Reduces risk if input is used in system commands (though avoid this pattern).
    *   Path Traversal (Medium Severity): Validation helps prevent malicious path manipulation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High - Significantly reduces SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High - Significantly reduces XSS vulnerability.
    *   Command Injection: Medium - Reduces command injection risk.
    *   Path Traversal: Medium - Reduces path traversal risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Partially implemented. Input validation used in key controllers.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Missing implementation: Extend input validation to all controllers and models handling user input.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Query Builder and Prepared Statements (CodeIgniter Database)](./mitigation_strategies/use_query_builder_and_prepared_statements__codeigniter_database_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer Query Builder:**  Utilize CodeIgniter's Query Builder (`$this->db`) for database interactions. It automatically escapes values.
    2.  **Prepared Statements (Advanced):** For complex queries or stored procedures, use prepared statements with parameter binding supported by CodeIgniter's database library.
    3.  **Avoid Raw Queries with Concatenation:**  Do not construct raw SQL queries by directly concatenating user input strings. This is a primary SQL injection risk.
    4.  **Review and Refactor:**  Audit existing code for raw SQL queries and refactor them to use Query Builder or prepared statements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity): Query Builder and prepared statements are the primary defense against SQL injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High - Significantly reduces SQL injection vulnerability.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Mostly implemented. Query Builder is standard practice.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Missing implementation: Refactor legacy raw SQL queries to Query Builder.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Output Encoding Functions (CodeIgniter Helpers)](./mitigation_strategies/employ_output_encoding_functions__codeigniter_helpers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Output Points in Views:** Find all locations in your CodeIgniter views where dynamic data (from database or user input) is displayed.
    2.  **Use `esc()` Function:**  Use CodeIgniter's `esc()` function (or `html_escape()` for HTML context) to encode output before displaying it in views.
    3.  **Context-Aware Encoding:**  Use appropriate encoding functions based on the output context (HTML, JavaScript, URL, CSS).  `esc()` is context-aware and generally recommended.
    4.  **Consistent Application:**  Apply output encoding consistently to *all* dynamic output in views to prevent XSS.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity): Output encoding prevents XSS by rendering potentially malicious scripts as plain text.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High - Significantly reduces XSS vulnerability.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Partially implemented. `esc()` used in newer views.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Missing implementation: Retroactively apply `esc()` to all dynamic output in existing views.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Session Settings (CodeIgniter Session Library)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_session_settings__codeigniter_session_library_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`config/config.php` Settings:** Review and configure session settings in `application/config/config.php`:
        *   `sess_cookie_secure`: Set to `TRUE` for HTTPS only cookies.
        *   `sess_http_only`: Set to `TRUE` to prevent JavaScript access to session cookies.
        *   `sess_time_to_update`: Adjust session regeneration frequency.
        *   `sess_driver`: Consider database or Redis (`database`, `redis`) for session storage instead of files (`files`) for better security and scalability.
    2.  **Session Driver Choice:** If using database or Redis, configure the necessary database/Redis connection settings in `database.php` or appropriate configuration files.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Session Hijacking (High Severity): Secure session settings reduce risks of session hijacking and session fixation.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity): `sess_http_only` mitigates some XSS-related session cookie theft.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Hijacking: High - Significantly reduces session hijacking and fixation risks.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium - Provides some mitigation against XSS-related cookie theft.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Partially implemented. `sess_cookie_secure` and `sess_http_only` are TRUE, but using file-based sessions.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable CSRF Protection (CodeIgniter CSRF Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_csrf_protection__codeigniter_csrf_feature_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable in `config.php`:** Set `$config['csrf_protection'] = TRUE;` in `application/config/config.php`.
    2.  **Form Helper Usage:** Use CodeIgniter's form helpers (e.g., `form_open()`) to automatically include CSRF tokens in forms.
    3.  **AJAX Handling:** For AJAX requests, retrieve the CSRF token (e.g., from meta tag or cookie - CodeIgniter provides `csrf_token()` and `csrf_header()` helpers) and include it in AJAX request headers or data.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity): CSRF protection prevents attackers from performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Medium - Significantly reduces CSRF vulnerability.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Yes, CSRF protection is enabled and form helpers are used.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Missing implementation: Implement AJAX CSRF token handling for all AJAX endpoints.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Form Helpers for CSRF Tokens (CodeIgniter Form Helper)](./mitigation_strategies/use_form_helpers_for_csrf_tokens__codeigniter_form_helper_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `form_open()`:**  When creating HTML forms in your views, consistently use CodeIgniter's `form_open()` helper function to generate the opening `<form>` tag. This function automatically injects the CSRF token as a hidden field.
    2.  **Avoid Manual Form Creation:**  Minimize or eliminate manually written `<form>` tags. Rely on `form_open()` to ensure CSRF tokens are always included.
    3.  **Verify Token on Submission:** CodeIgniter automatically verifies the CSRF token on form submissions when CSRF protection is enabled in `config.php`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity): Ensures CSRF tokens are present in forms, preventing CSRF attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Medium - Strengthens CSRF protection by ensuring token inclusion in forms.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Yes, `form_open()` is used for all forms.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: No missing implementation.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle AJAX CSRF Tokens (CodeIgniter CSRF Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/handle_ajax_csrf_tokens__codeigniter_csrf_feature_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Retrieve CSRF Token:** In your JavaScript code, retrieve the CSRF token. CodeIgniter provides `csrf_token()` and `csrf_header()` helpers to access the token value and header name. You can render these in a meta tag in your layout or access them via server-side code.
    2.  **Include in AJAX Requests:**  For every AJAX request that modifies data (POST, PUT, DELETE), include the CSRF token. You can include it as:
        *   **Request Header:**  Set a custom header with the token (e.g., `X-CSRF-TOKEN: <token_value>`). Use `csrf_header()` to get the header name.
        *   **Request Data:** Include the token as part of the POST data. Use `csrf_token()` to get the token name and value.
    3.  **Server-Side Verification:** CodeIgniter automatically verifies CSRF tokens in headers or POST data when CSRF protection is enabled.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity): Extends CSRF protection to AJAX requests, securing AJAX-driven actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Medium - Extends CSRF protection to AJAX, crucial for modern web applications.

    2.  **Configure Allowed Types:** Set the `allowed_types` configuration option in the Upload library configuration (`$config['upload_path']`, `$config['allowed_types']`, etc.).  Specify only the file types that are genuinely required for your application. Be restrictive.
    3.  **Validate Upload:** Use `$this->upload->do_upload()` to perform the upload and validation. Check for upload errors using `$this->upload->display_errors()`.
    4.  **Extension Validation:** CodeIgniter's Upload library validates file extensions based on MIME types. Ensure your allowed types are correctly configured.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious File Upload (High Severity): Prevents users from uploading executable files or other malicious file types that could be exploited.
    *   Information Disclosure (Low Severity): Prevents upload of unexpected file types that might reveal information if publicly accessible.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious File Upload: High - Significantly reduces the risk of malicious file uploads.
    *   Information Disclosure: Low - Reduces risk of unintended information disclosure via file uploads.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Partially implemented. File type validation is used for image uploads, but not for all file upload functionalities.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Missing implementation: Implement file type validation using CodeIgniter's Upload library for all file upload features in the application.]

    2.  **Manual Sanitization (Recommended):** Implement more robust filename sanitization.  Before saving uploaded files, sanitize filenames to:
        *   Remove or replace special characters, spaces, and non-alphanumeric characters.
        *   Convert to lowercase.
        *   Limit filename length.
        *   Generate unique and unpredictable filenames (e.g., using UUIDs or timestamps combined with random strings).
    3.  **Avoid Original Filenames:**  Do not directly use user-provided filenames for storing files. Generate new, sanitized filenames.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   File Path Manipulation (Medium Severity): Sanitized filenames prevent attackers from crafting filenames that could be used for path traversal or other file system exploits.
    *   Operating System Command Injection (Low Severity): Reduces risk if filenames are used in system commands (though avoid this pattern).
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Low Severity):  Sanitizing filenames can prevent some XSS risks if filenames are displayed directly in the browser (though output encoding is the primary defense).

*   **Impact:**
    *   File Path Manipulation: Medium - Reduces file path manipulation risks.
    *   Operating System Command Injection: Low - Minor reduction in command injection risk.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Low - Minor contribution to XSS prevention.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: No, filenames are not sanitized beyond CodeIgniter's default.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Missing implementation: Implement robust filename sanitization logic before saving uploaded files. Refactor file upload handling to generate sanitized filenames.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Route Access (CodeIgniter Routing & Authorization)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_route_access__codeigniter_routing_&_authorization_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Routes Carefully:**  Plan your CodeIgniter routes to reflect the application's structure and access control requirements.
    2.  **Controller-Based Authorization:** Implement authorization logic within your controllers. Use CodeIgniter's session management or authentication libraries to check user roles and permissions before granting access to controller methods.
    3.  **Route-Level Middleware/Filters (CodeIgniter 4+):**  If using CodeIgniter 4 or later, leverage route-level middleware or filters to enforce authorization rules *before* controllers are executed. This is a more centralized and efficient approach.
    4.  **Avoid Publicly Accessible Admin Panels:**  Ensure administrative or sensitive routes are protected by authentication and authorization. Do not rely on obscurity for security.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity): Restricting route access prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive parts of the application or performing actions they are not permitted to.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Proper route access control helps prevent privilege escalation attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High - Significantly reduces unauthorized access to sensitive application areas.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium - Reduces privilege escalation risks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Partially implemented. Basic controller-level authorization is in place for some admin routes.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Missing implementation: Implement comprehensive route access control for all sensitive areas. Consider using middleware/filters for centralized authorization (if using CodeIgniter 4+).]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Exposing Internal Structure in Routes (CodeIgniter Routing Design)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_exposing_internal_structure_in_routes__codeigniter_routing_design_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Abstract Route Patterns:** Design routes that are user-friendly and abstract away the internal controller and method names. Avoid routes that directly map to controller/method structures (e.g., `/users/editUser/123`).
    2.  **Use RESTful Routing (Where Applicable):**  Adopt RESTful routing principles where appropriate. This often leads to more abstract and less revealing route patterns (e.g., `/api/users/123` with HTTP methods like GET, PUT, DELETE).
    3.  **Custom Route Definitions:**  Use CodeIgniter's routing configuration (`application/config/routes.php`) to define custom routes that are decoupled from the physical controller/method structure.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Low Severity):  Obscuring internal structure in routes makes it slightly harder for attackers to guess controller and method names, reducing reconnaissance opportunities.
    *   Obfuscation (Low Severity):  More abstract routes improve aesthetics and reduce predictability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Low - Minimally reduces information disclosure about internal structure.
    *   Obfuscation: Low - Minor improvement in URL clarity and slight obfuscation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Partially implemented. Some routes are abstract, but others still reveal controller/method names.]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [**Project Specific - Replace with actual status.** Example: Missing implementation: Review and refactor routes to be more abstract and less revealing of internal structure. Define custom routes in `routes.php`.]
