Okay, let's create a design document for the CodeIgniter project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

CodeIgniter is a PHP framework for building web applications.  It's an open-source project, suggesting a community-driven development model.  The business priorities likely revolve around:

*   Ease of Use:  Making it simple for developers to build applications quickly.
*   Community Growth:  Attracting and retaining a vibrant community of users and contributors.
*   Maintainability:  Ensuring the framework remains relevant and updated over time.
*   Performance:  Providing a framework that allows for the creation of performant web applications.
*   Adoption: Increasing the number of projects and companies using CodeIgniter.

Based on these priorities, the most important business risks are:

*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the framework could expose applications built with it to attacks, damaging the reputation and adoption of CodeIgniter. This is the most critical risk.
*   Lack of Maintenance:  If the project is not actively maintained, it will become outdated, insecure, and less attractive to developers.
*   Competition:  Other PHP frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, etc.) compete for market share. CodeIgniter needs to remain competitive in features, security, and performance.
*   Community Fragmentation:  A divided or inactive community can hinder development and support.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the provided GitHub repository, the following security controls and accepted risks can be identified.  It's important to note that this is an assessment of the *framework* itself, not necessarily of applications built *with* the framework.  Application-level security is heavily dependent on how developers use CodeIgniter.

*   security control: Input Validation: CodeIgniter provides libraries and helpers for input validation (form validation library, input filtering). Implemented in system/libraries/Form_validation.php and system/core/Input.php.
*   security control: Output Encoding:  CodeIgniter encourages output encoding to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through its templating engine and helper functions. Implemented in system/core/Output.php and related view handling.
*   security control: CSRF Protection: CodeIgniter offers built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. Implemented in system/core/Security.php and configured in application/config/config.php.
*   security control: Database Security: CodeIgniter uses parameterized queries (when used correctly) to help prevent SQL injection. Implemented in system/database/DB_driver.php and its subclasses.
*   security control: Session Management: CodeIgniter provides session management features. Implemented in system/libraries/Session.php.
*   security control: File Upload Handling: CodeIgniter includes a file upload class with some security checks. Implemented in system/libraries/Upload.php.
*   security control: Error Handling and Logging: CodeIgniter has error handling and logging capabilities. Implemented in system/core/Exceptions.php and related configuration.
*   security control: Security-related configuration options: The config.php file contains various security-related settings. Described in application/config/config.php.
*   accepted risk: Developer Misuse:  CodeIgniter, like any framework, can be used insecurely.  The framework provides tools, but it's the developer's responsibility to use them correctly. This is a significant accepted risk, inherent in providing a development framework.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Libraries:  Applications built with CodeIgniter may use third-party libraries, which are outside the scope of the framework's security.
*   accepted risk: Outdated Versions: Users may be running outdated versions of CodeIgniter with known vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Dependency Management Security: Implement a robust system for managing dependencies and ensuring they are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities. This could involve using tools like Composer and regularly scanning for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) Support:  Provide helpers or guidance for implementing CSP to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks.
*   security control: HTTP Security Headers: Encourage or facilitate the setting of security-related HTTP headers (e.g., Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the framework itself.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: The framework should provide mechanisms or guidance for secure user authentication, including password hashing (using strong, modern algorithms like Argon2 or bcrypt) and secure storage of credentials. While CodeIgniter provides session management, specific authentication implementations are left to the developer.
*   Authorization: The framework should provide mechanisms or guidance for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization schemes.  This is largely left to the developer, but the framework should offer tools to facilitate it.
*   Input Validation: All user-supplied input (including form data, URL parameters, and headers) must be validated rigorously to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.).  CodeIgniter provides libraries for this, but their correct use is crucial.
*   Cryptography: The framework should provide secure cryptographic functions for tasks such as password hashing, encryption, and secure random number generation.  It should use well-vetted libraries and algorithms.
*   Output Encoding: All output to the browser must be properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  CodeIgniter's templating system and helper functions should encourage this.

## BUILD

The build process for a CodeIgniter application, especially when containerized, typically involves the following steps:

1.  Code Checkout: The CI/CD pipeline checks out the latest code from the Git repository.
2.  Dependency Installation: Dependencies are installed (e.g., using Composer for PHP dependencies).
3.  Testing: Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are run to ensure code quality and functionality.
4.  Security Scans:
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Tools like PHPStan, Psalm, or commercial SAST tools are used to analyze the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Dependency Scanning: Tools like Composer audit or OWASP Dependency-Check are used to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   Container Image Scanning: If using Docker, the Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy, Clair, or Anchore.
5.  Build Artifact: The application code, along with its dependencies, is packaged into a deployable artifact (e.g., a Docker image).
6.  Artifact Storage: The build artifact is pushed to a storage location (e.g., a container registry).

    *   Data Processing: Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data processed by applications built with CodeIgniter.
    *   Application Availability: Maintaining the availability of applications built with the framework.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Usernames, email addresses, passwords (hashed), addresses, phone numbers, etc. (High Sensitivity)
    *   Financial Data: Payment information, transaction history (if applicable). (High Sensitivity)
    *   Application-Specific Data: Data specific to the application's functionality (e.g., content, user-generated data). (Variable Sensitivity - depends on the application)
    *   Session Data: Session identifiers and associated data. (Medium Sensitivity)
    *   Configuration Data: Database credentials, API keys, etc. (High Sensitivity)

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What specific version control system is used (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)? This impacts the specifics of CI/CD integration and security controls.
    *   What specific CI/CD platform is used (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)? This affects the implementation details of the build and deployment process.
    *   What specific database system(s) are commonly used with CodeIgniter applications? This influences database security recommendations.
    *   What is the typical deployment environment for CodeIgniter applications (shared hosting, cloud, etc.)? This impacts the deployment diagram and security considerations.
    *   Are there any existing security policies or guidelines for CodeIgniter development or deployment?
    *   What level of security expertise is assumed for developers using CodeIgniter?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a flexible and easy-to-use framework, with security being a critical but not necessarily the *sole* driving factor.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: Developers have a basic understanding of web security principles, but may not be security experts. The framework provides some security features, but secure usage is ultimately the developer's responsibility.
    *   DESIGN: A standard LAMP-like stack is a common deployment environment. Composer is used for dependency management. A CI/CD pipeline is desirable but may not always be present.
    *   The project is open source and community driven.
    *   The project is actively maintained.
    *   Developers using the framework have varying levels of security expertise.
    *   Applications built with CodeIgniter may handle sensitive data.
    *   A significant portion of the security responsibility lies with the developers using the framework.
