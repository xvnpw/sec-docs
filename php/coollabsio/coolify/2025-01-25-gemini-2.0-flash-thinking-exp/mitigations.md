### Mitigation Strategy: Regularly Update Coolify Instance

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Coolify Releases:** Regularly check the official Coolify GitHub repository ([https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify)) or subscribe to release notifications to stay informed about new Coolify versions.
    2.  **Review Coolify Release Notes for Security Patches:** Carefully read the release notes for each new Coolify version to specifically identify security patches and vulnerability fixes that are addressed in the update.
    3.  **Backup Coolify Data Before Updating:** Before initiating a Coolify update, use Coolify's backup functionality (if available) or manually backup the Coolify database and configuration files. This allows for rollback within Coolify in case of update issues.
    4.  **Apply Coolify Updates via Provided Mechanisms:** Follow the official Coolify documentation for the specific upgrade instructions for your installation method. Utilize the update mechanisms provided by Coolify (e.g., scripts, UI update buttons if available).
    5.  **Verify Coolify Version Post-Update:** After the update process, verify within the Coolify UI or via the Coolify CLI that the instance is running the latest version to confirm successful update.
    6.  **Test Core Coolify Functionality:** After updating Coolify, test core functionalities like application deployment, service management, and database connections within Coolify to ensure the update hasn't introduced regressions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Coolify Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Outdated Coolify instances are susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities within the Coolify platform itself, which attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access to Coolify, its configurations, or potentially deployed applications.
    *   Data Breaches via Coolify Platform Exploits (High Severity) - Vulnerabilities in Coolify could be directly exploited to access sensitive data managed by Coolify, such as environment variables, secrets, or database connection details, leading to data breaches of deployed applications.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of Coolify Platform (Medium Severity) - Unpatched bugs in Coolify itself could be exploited to cause crashes or performance degradation of the Coolify platform, leading to denial of service for managing and deploying applications.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Coolify Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction - Directly addresses and eliminates known vulnerabilities *within Coolify*, significantly reducing the attack surface of the platform itself.
    *   Data Breaches via Coolify Platform Exploits: High Risk Reduction - Reduces the likelihood of data breaches stemming from vulnerabilities *in the Coolify platform*.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of Coolify Platform: Medium Risk Reduction - Patches that address stability issues in Coolify can reduce the risk of DoS attacks targeting the *Coolify platform itself*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Coolify provides release notes and update mechanisms. However, the update process is primarily manual and relies on user-initiated actions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated Update Notifications within Coolify UI -  A notification system *within the Coolify UI* to proactively alert administrators about available Coolify updates.
    *   Optional Automatic Coolify Updates (with user consent and rollback) -  Consider offering an option for automatic Coolify updates (perhaps for non-production instances initially) with clear warnings, user consent, and documented rollback procedures *within Coolify*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Coolify UI and API](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_coolify_ui_and_api.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Restrict Access to Coolify UI and API

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Strong Passwords for Coolify Users:** When creating user accounts within Coolify, enforce strong password policies. Encourage or require users to create complex, unique passwords for their Coolify accounts.
    2.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Coolify Logins:** Enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Coolify user logins. Utilize MFA methods supported by Coolify (if any) or consider integrating with external MFA providers if Coolify allows for it.
    3.  **Utilize Coolify's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Leverage Coolify's built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) features to meticulously manage user permissions within Coolify. Grant users the minimum necessary privileges required for their roles in managing applications and infrastructure through Coolify.
    4.  **Implement IP Whitelisting in Network Configuration (if feasible with Coolify deployment):** If your Coolify deployment environment allows for network-level IP whitelisting, configure it to restrict access to the Coolify UI and API ports to only trusted IP addresses or networks. This is an external configuration but directly enhances Coolify access security.
    5.  **Recommend VPN Access for Remote Coolify Access:**  If remote access to Coolify is required, strongly recommend and document the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to secure access to the Coolify UI and API from outside the trusted network. This is a best practice to be communicated to Coolify users.
    6.  **Regularly Review Coolify User Access and Roles:** Periodically review the list of Coolify user accounts and their assigned roles within Coolify. Revoke access for users who no longer require it and adjust roles as needed to maintain least privilege.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Coolify UI/API (High Severity) - Weak Coolify user credentials or insufficient access controls *within Coolify* can allow unauthorized individuals to access the Coolify platform, potentially leading to malicious modifications of deployments, data breaches of application configurations, and service disruption managed by Coolify.
    *   Privilege Escalation within Coolify (Medium Severity) - If Coolify's RBAC is not properly configured, attackers who gain initial access with limited Coolify privileges might be able to exploit misconfigurations to escalate their privileges *within the Coolify platform* and gain administrative control.
    *   Insider Threats via Coolify Access (Medium Severity) - Restricting access and using RBAC *within Coolify* helps mitigate risks associated with malicious or negligent insiders who have legitimate Coolify accounts but could abuse their access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Coolify UI/API: High Risk Reduction - Strong authentication, MFA (if implemented in Coolify), and access restrictions *within Coolify* significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the platform.
    *   Privilege Escalation within Coolify: Medium Risk Reduction - RBAC *in Coolify* helps limit the potential damage of compromised accounts by restricting their actions within the platform.
    *   Insider Threats via Coolify Access: Medium Risk Reduction -  Reduces the potential damage from insider threats by limiting access and privileges *within Coolify*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Coolify has basic user authentication and RBAC features.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Built-in MFA Support in Coolify - Implement native MFA support *directly within Coolify* (e.g., using TOTP or WebAuthn) to enhance user login security.
    *   IP Whitelisting Feature within Coolify UI -  Provide a user-friendly interface *within the Coolify UI* to configure IP whitelisting for access control to the Coolify platform itself (if technically feasible within Coolify's architecture).
    *   Stronger Password Policy Enforcement in Coolify - Implement more robust password policy enforcement *within Coolify's user management*, such as password complexity requirements and password rotation reminders.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Secrets Management within Coolify](./mitigation_strategies/secure_secrets_management_within_coolify.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Secrets Management within Coolify

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandatory Utilization of Coolify Environment Variables and Secrets:**  Enforce the use of Coolify's built-in environment variable and secrets management features for injecting sensitive information into applications deployed via Coolify. Discourage or prevent hardcoding secrets in application code or configuration files managed by Coolify.
    2.  **Prohibit Storing Secrets in Version Control for Coolify Managed Applications:**  Clearly document and enforce a policy against committing secrets directly to version control systems for applications managed through Coolify. Promote the use of Coolify's secret management instead.
    3.  **Implement Secret Rotation Procedures within Coolify (if feasible):** Explore if Coolify offers any features for secret rotation or if procedures can be implemented around Coolify to regularly rotate secrets used by applications and within Coolify itself (e.g., database passwords managed by Coolify).
    4.  **Investigate and Integrate with External Secret Management Solutions (if Coolify allows extensibility):**  Assess the feasibility of integrating Coolify with external secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault. If Coolify's architecture allows for extensibility, develop or request integrations to provide users with more advanced secret management options *within the Coolify ecosystem*.
    5.  **Implement Least Privilege for Secrets Access within Coolify:**  Ensure that within Coolify's secret management system, only authorized applications and services deployed through Coolify have access to the specific secrets they require. Utilize Coolify's RBAC or any available secret access control mechanisms to enforce least privilege for secrets.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets via Coolify Misconfiguration (High Severity) -  If Coolify's secrets management is not properly utilized or configured, secrets could be exposed through misconfigurations within Coolify, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive application data or infrastructure.
    *   Secret Sprawl and Management Complexity within Coolify (Medium Severity) -  Without robust secret management *within Coolify*, managing secrets for multiple applications and services deployed through Coolify can become complex and error-prone, increasing the risk of accidental exposure or misconfiguration.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets Managed by Coolify (High Severity) -  If access controls to secrets *within Coolify* are weak or non-existent, unauthorized users or applications (even within the Coolify environment) could potentially gain access to sensitive secrets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets via Coolify Misconfiguration: High Risk Reduction - Enforcing and properly using Coolify's secret management features eliminates the risk of easily exposed hardcoded secrets *within the Coolify managed environment*.
    *   Secret Sprawl and Management Complexity within Coolify: Medium Risk Reduction - Centralized secret management *within Coolify* simplifies secret management for applications deployed via the platform and reduces the risk of management errors.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets Managed by Coolify: High Risk Reduction - Access control mechanisms *within Coolify's secret management* ensure that only authorized entities can access secrets managed by the platform.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Coolify provides basic environment variable and secrets management features.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Built-in Secret Rotation Features in Coolify -  Implement features *within Coolify* to automate or simplify secret rotation for secrets managed by the platform.
    *   Native Integration with External Secret Managers in Coolify -  Develop native integrations *within Coolify* with popular external secret management solutions to offer users more advanced and enterprise-grade secret management capabilities directly integrated into the Coolify workflow.
