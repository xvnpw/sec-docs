### High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Coolify:

*   **Attack Surface:** Weak or Default Coolify Admin Panel Credentials
    *   **Description:** The Coolify admin panel is protected by credentials. If these are weak or left at default values, attackers can gain full control.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify provides a web interface for managing the entire platform. The security of this interface directly depends on the strength of the admin credentials.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses default credentials found in documentation or brute-forces a weak password to gain full control of the Coolify instance.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Coolify instance, allowing management of all deployed applications, infrastructure, and potentially access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for the Coolify admin user.
        *   Mandate changing default credentials during initial setup.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the admin panel.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Storage and Handling of API Keys
    *   **Description:** Coolify uses API keys for authentication and authorization. If these keys are stored insecurely or transmitted without proper encryption, they can be compromised.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify generates and manages API keys for users and potentially for internal communication between components. The security of these keys is crucial for maintaining control over resources.
    *   **Example:** API keys are stored in plain text in Coolify's database or configuration files, allowing an attacker with database access to obtain them. API keys are transmitted over unencrypted HTTP.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Coolify's API, allowing attackers to manage resources, deploy malicious applications, or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely using encryption at rest.
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication involving API keys.
        *   Implement proper access controls and permissions for API keys (least privilege).
        *   Provide mechanisms for users to rotate or revoke API keys.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insufficient Input Validation on Configuration Parameters
    *   **Description:** Coolify allows users to configure various parameters for applications, databases, and services. Lack of proper input validation can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify takes user input for configuration settings and uses this input to interact with underlying systems (e.g., Docker, server configurations).
    *   **Example:** A user provides a malicious command within an environment variable setting, which Coolify then executes on the underlying server during deployment.
    *   **Impact:** Command injection, potentially leading to full server compromise or unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided configuration parameters.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
        *   Avoid directly executing user-provided input as commands.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Coolify's Update Mechanism
    *   **Description:** The process of updating Coolify itself can be an attack vector if not properly secured.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify needs a mechanism to update its own codebase and dependencies. If this process is flawed, attackers could inject malicious updates.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises Coolify's update server or uses a man-in-the-middle attack to deliver a malicious update to Coolify instances.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Coolify platform and all managed resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure update mechanisms with integrity checks (e.g., signed updates).
        *   Use HTTPS for downloading updates.
        *   Provide clear communication to users about the update process and its security.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Internal Services due to Misconfiguration
    *   **Description:** Coolify might expose internal services or components unintentionally due to misconfigurations in its networking setup.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify manages networking configurations for its own components and the applications it deploys. Incorrect settings can lead to unintended exposure.
    *   **Example:** The Coolify admin panel or internal databases are accessible from the public internet due to firewall misconfigurations managed by Coolify.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive internal services, potential data breaches, or control plane compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring network access.
        *   Implement strong firewall rules to restrict access to internal services.
        *   Regularly audit network configurations for unintended exposure.
