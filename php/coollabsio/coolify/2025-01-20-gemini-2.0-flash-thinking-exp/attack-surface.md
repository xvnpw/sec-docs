# Attack Surface Analysis for coollabsio/coolify

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Coolify Agent](./attack_surfaces/compromised_coolify_agent.md)

*   **Description:** If the Coolify agent running on a target server is compromised, an attacker can gain full control over that server.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Coolify relies on agents installed on target servers to manage deployments, execute commands, and monitor resources. The security of these agents is paramount.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Coolify agent software or gains access to the credentials used by the Coolify server to communicate with the agent, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the managed server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, service disruption, potential pivot point for further attacks within the infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Coolify agent software updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) between the Coolify server and the agents.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for agent access and control.
        *   Regularly audit the security of the agent software and its dependencies.
        *   Consider network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised agent.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Communication Between Coolify Server and Agents](./attack_surfaces/insecure_communication_between_coolify_server_and_agents.md)

*   **Description:** If the communication channel between the Coolify server and the agents is not properly secured, attackers could eavesdrop on or manipulate commands.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Coolify needs to send instructions and receive data from its agents. If this communication is vulnerable, the integrity and confidentiality of the system are at risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between the Coolify server and an agent, gaining access to sensitive information like deployment credentials or manipulating commands to deploy malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access to target servers, ability to manipulate deployments and configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all communication between the Coolify server and agents.
        *   Implement mutual authentication to ensure both the server and the agent are who they claim to be.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in communication logs.
        *   Regularly review and update the security protocols used for communication.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Coolify Web Interface (Authentication & Authorization)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_coolify_web_interface__authentication_&_authorization_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Coolify's web interface authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Coolify's web interface is the primary point of interaction for users to manage their infrastructure and deployments. Weaknesses here directly expose the entire platform.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in the login form to bypass authentication, or leverages an authorization flaw to gain administrative privileges and manage other users' resources.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Coolify platform, ability to manage and compromise infrastructure, data breaches, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Regularly audit and penetration test the authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
        *   Adopt the principle of least privilege for user roles and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Coolify's API endpoints could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive data programmatically.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Coolify likely exposes an API for automation and integration. Insecure API endpoints can be a direct entry point for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an API endpoint with insufficient authentication to create new users with administrative privileges, or leverages an insecure endpoint to retrieve sensitive configuration data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Coolify platform and its functionalities, data breaches, ability to manipulate infrastructure programmatically.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all API endpoints (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Enforce rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received by API endpoints.
        *   Document API endpoints clearly and restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly audit and penetration test the API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Integrations (Git, Container Registries)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_integrations__git__container_registries_.md)

*   **Description:** Compromised credentials or vulnerabilities in how Coolify integrates with external services like Git repositories or container registries can lead to supply chain attacks or data breaches.
    *   **How Coolify Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Coolify relies on integrations to fetch code and container images. Weak security in these integrations can have cascading effects.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises the Git credentials stored *by Coolify* and injects malicious code into a repository, which is then deployed by Coolify. Alternatively, compromised container registry credentials *used by Coolify* could allow the deployment of malicious container images.
    *   **Impact:** Supply chain attacks, deployment of malicious code, exposure of sensitive information stored in repositories or registries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage credentials for external integrations *within Coolify* (e.g., using secrets management solutions).
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization when connecting to external services *from Coolify*.
        *   Verify the integrity of code and container images before deployment (e.g., using checksums or signatures).
        *   Regularly rotate credentials for external integrations *used by Coolify*.
        *   Monitor integration activity for suspicious behavior *within Coolify*.
