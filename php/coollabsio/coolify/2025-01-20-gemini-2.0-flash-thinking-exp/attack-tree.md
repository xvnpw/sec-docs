## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Coolify [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_coolify__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal. Any successful path leading to this node represents a critical compromise of the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Coolify Instance Directly [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_coolify_instance_directly__critical_.md)

This represents a direct attack on the Coolify platform itself. Success here grants broad control over all applications managed by that instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Coolify Web Interface Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_coolify_web_interface_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in Coolify's web interface to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
    * **Exploit Vulnerability (e.g., Authentication Bypass, Authorization Flaw, RCE, Injection) [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing login mechanisms to gain administrative access without proper credentials.
        * **Authorization Flaw:** Exploiting weaknesses in access controls to perform actions or access data beyond the attacker's privileges.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Executing arbitrary code on the server hosting Coolify, granting full control.
        * **Injection Attacks (SQLi, Command Injection):** Injecting malicious code into input fields to manipulate the database or execute system commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying Infrastructure Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_infrastructure_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities in the operating system, Docker installation, or other software components on the server hosting Coolify.
    * **Exploit Vulnerability to gain access to Coolify's environment [CRITICAL]:**
        * Leveraging vulnerabilities in the host OS or containerization platform to gain shell access or escalate privileges on the server running Coolify.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Coolify Configuration Files/Database [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/access_coolify_configuration_filesdatabase__critical_.md)

Attackers aim to directly access sensitive configuration files or the database used by Coolify.
    * **Exploit Database Vulnerability (if Coolify stores sensitive data in a database) [CRITICAL]:**
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the database system used by Coolify to access or modify sensitive information like credentials or application configurations.
    * **Gain Unauthorized Access to Server Hosting Coolify [CRITICAL]:**
        * Compromising the server through other means (e.g., SSH brute-force, OS vulnerabilities) to gain direct access to configuration files.
    * **Exploit Weak Default Credentials or Poor Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
        * Utilizing default or easily guessable credentials for Coolify itself or the underlying infrastructure.
        * Exploiting insecure configurations that expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Coolify's Deployment Process [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_coolify's_deployment_process__critical_.md)

Attackers target the mechanisms Coolify uses to deploy and manage applications.
    * **Inject Malicious Code during Build/Deployment [CRITICAL]:**
        * Introducing malicious code into the application during the build or deployment process managed by Coolify.
            * **Compromise the Source Code Repository linked to Coolify [CRITICAL]:**
                * Gaining unauthorized access to the application's source code repository and injecting malicious code directly.
            * **Manipulate Build Scripts or Dockerfiles used by Coolify [CRITICAL]:**
                * Altering the scripts or Dockerfiles used by Coolify to build and deploy the application to include malicious steps or dependencies.
            * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Buildpacks or Docker Images used by Coolify [CRITICAL]:**
                * Utilizing compromised or vulnerable buildpacks or base Docker images that introduce vulnerabilities into the deployed application.
    * **Manipulate Environment Variables during Deployment [CRITICAL]:**
        * Altering the environment variables used by the deployed application to inject malicious configurations or expose sensitive information.
            * **Gain Access to Coolify's Environment Variable Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
                * Compromising Coolify to gain access to the interface or storage where environment variables are managed.
            * **Inject Malicious Environment Variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys) [CRITICAL]:**
                * Injecting environment variables containing malicious code or exposing sensitive credentials that the application will use.
