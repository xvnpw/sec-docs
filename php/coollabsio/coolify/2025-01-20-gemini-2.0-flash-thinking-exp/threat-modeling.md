# Threat Model Analysis for coollabsio/coolify

## Threat: [Compromised Coolify Instance](./threats/compromised_coolify_instance.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Coolify server or its underlying infrastructure by exploiting vulnerabilities *within the Coolify application itself* or through compromised Coolify user credentials. Once inside, the attacker can manipulate deployments, access sensitive data managed by Coolify, and control the entire Coolify environment.

**Impact:** Complete control over all applications managed by Coolify, including the ability to deploy malicious code, access application data and secrets stored or managed by Coolify, disrupt services, and potentially pivot to other connected infrastructure *through Coolify's access*.

**Affected Component:** Coolify Server (Core Application, potentially underlying OS and infrastructure *directly managed by Coolify*)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong password policies and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Coolify user accounts.
* Regularly patch the Coolify application to address known vulnerabilities.
* Restrict network access to the Coolify instance, allowing only necessary connections.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor for malicious activity targeting the Coolify instance.
* Regularly back up the Coolify instance configuration and data.

## Threat: [Insecure API Endpoints](./threats/insecure_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Coolify exposes API endpoints for managing deployments, configurations, and other functionalities. If these endpoints lack proper authentication, authorization, or input validation *within the Coolify API implementation*, an attacker could exploit them to perform unauthorized actions. This could involve directly accessing the API or exploiting vulnerabilities like injection flaws *in Coolify's API handling*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized application deployments or rollbacks *via Coolify*, modification of application settings and environment variables *managed by Coolify*, exposure of sensitive information *accessible through the Coolify API*, denial of service by disrupting deployments *through Coolify*, and potentially gaining access to underlying infrastructure *managed by Coolify*.

**Affected Component:** Coolify API (Backend, potentially specific API routes like `/api/deployments`, `/api/configurations`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all Coolify API endpoints.
* Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all Coolify API endpoints to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection if Coolify's API interacts with a database).
* Rate-limit Coolify API requests to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* Regularly audit Coolify API endpoints for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised Coolify Agent](./threats/compromised_coolify_agent.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Coolify agent running on a target server by exploiting vulnerabilities *within the Coolify agent software itself* or through compromised credentials used *by the agent to communicate with the Coolify server*.

**Impact:** Ability to execute arbitrary code on the target server *through the compromised Coolify agent*, access application data and secrets residing on that server *accessible to the agent*, potentially pivot to other systems on the network *via the compromised agent's access*, and disrupt the applications managed by that agent.

**Affected Component:** Coolify Agent (running on target servers)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure secure communication between the Coolify server and agents (e.g., using TLS encryption).
* Regularly update the Coolify agent software to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for agent communication with the server.
* Monitor agent activity for suspicious behavior.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication between Coolify Server and Agent](./threats/insecure_communication_between_coolify_server_and_agent.md)

**Description:** The communication channel between the central Coolify server and its agents is not properly secured *due to Coolify's implementation*. An attacker could intercept this communication to eavesdrop on sensitive data (like deployment commands or secrets) or manipulate commands to deploy malicious code or alter configurations *managed by Coolify*.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information exchanged between the Coolify server and agent, ability to execute unauthorized commands on target servers *via manipulated Coolify commands*, and deployment of malicious code *through Coolify's deployment mechanisms*.

**Affected Component:** Coolify Communication Protocol (between server and agent)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure all communication between the Coolify server and agents is encrypted using TLS/SSL *as implemented by Coolify*.
* Implement mutual authentication between the server and agents to verify their identities *within Coolify's communication framework*.
* Avoid transmitting sensitive information in plain text over the communication channel *within Coolify's internal communication*.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Secrets](./threats/insecure_storage_of_secrets.md)

**Description:** Coolify needs to manage sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and TLS certificates. If these secrets are stored insecurely *within Coolify's data storage* (e.g., in plain text in configuration files or a poorly secured database managed by Coolify), an attacker gaining access to the Coolify instance could easily retrieve them.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials *managed by Coolify*, leading to unauthorized access to external services, databases, and other critical resources *that Coolify integrates with*. This could result in data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Coolify Secrets Management (potentially configuration files, database used by Coolify, or dedicated secrets storage within Coolify)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest) *and ensure Coolify integrates with them securely*.
* Avoid storing secrets directly in Coolify's configuration files or environment variables.
* Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit *within Coolify's storage mechanisms*.
* Implement access controls within Coolify to restrict who can access stored secrets.

## Threat: [Compromised Git Provider Integration](./threats/compromised_git_provider_integration.md)

**Description:** Coolify integrates with Git providers (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to fetch application code. If the credentials used *by Coolify* for this integration are compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code into the repository, which Coolify would then deploy.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised application code *via Coolify*, potentially leading to application vulnerabilities, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Coolify Git Integration Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, unique credentials for Git provider integration *within Coolify*.
* Store Git provider credentials securely *within Coolify's secrets management*.
* Regularly review and audit access to the Git repositories *used by Coolify*.

## Threat: [Insecure Container Registry Integration](./threats/insecure_container_registry_integration.md)

**Description:** Coolify integrates with container registries (like Docker Hub, GitLab Container Registry) to pull container images. If the credentials used *by Coolify* for this integration are compromised, an attacker could push malicious container images that Coolify would then deploy.

**Impact:** Deployment of compromised container images *via Coolify*, potentially containing malware or vulnerabilities, leading to application compromise and system-wide issues.

**Affected Component:** Coolify Container Registry Integration Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use strong, unique credentials for container registry integration *within Coolify*.
* Store container registry credentials securely *within Coolify's secrets management*.
* Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment *as part of the Coolify deployment process*.

## Threat: [Insufficient Input Validation in Configurations](./threats/insufficient_input_validation_in_configurations.md)

**Description:** Coolify allows users to configure various aspects of deployments and infrastructure. If input validation is insufficient *within Coolify's configuration handling*, attackers could inject malicious code or commands through configuration settings, leading to command injection or other vulnerabilities *exploitable through Coolify*.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands on the Coolify server or target servers *via Coolify's configuration processing*, potentially leading to system compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Coolify Configuration Modules (e.g., deployment settings, environment variable configuration)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all configuration parameters *handled by Coolify*.
* Avoid directly executing user-provided input as commands *within Coolify's code*.
* Enforce type checking and length limitations on configuration values *within Coolify's validation logic*.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./threats/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** If the process for updating Coolify itself or its agents is insecure *due to Coolify's implementation*, an attacker could potentially inject malicious updates, compromising the system. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities in the update process *implemented by Coolify*.

**Impact:** Compromise of the Coolify server and agents, leading to full control over the managed infrastructure and applications.

**Affected Component:** Coolify Update Mechanism

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure updates are delivered over a secure channel (HTTPS) *as part of Coolify's update process*.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., using cryptographic signatures) to verify the authenticity of updates *within Coolify's update mechanism*.
