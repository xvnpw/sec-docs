*   **Description:** Targeting vulnerabilities in Coolify's web interface or API to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Why Critical:** The Web UI/API is the primary management interface, making it a prime target for attackers. Successful exploitation can grant broad control over Coolify and deployed applications.

    **1.1. Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Circumventing Coolify's authentication mechanisms to gain access without valid credentials.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Direct and often easy path to unauthorized access.

                *   **Default Credentials:** Attempting to log in using default usernames and passwords that might be set during initial Coolify installation or for default admin accounts.
                *   **Weak Passwords:** Brute-forcing or dictionary attacks against accounts if Coolify allows weak passwords or doesn't enforce strong password policies.
                *   **Credential Stuffing:** Using compromised credentials from other breaches that users might have reused for their Coolify accounts.

    **1.2. Authorization Flaws [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in Coolify's authorization logic to access resources or perform actions beyond the attacker's intended permissions.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Can lead to privilege escalation and access to sensitive data or functionalities.

        *   **1.2.1. Privilege Escalation (Gain admin access from lower-level user) [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vectors:**

                *   **Unsanitized Input in Scripts:** Injecting malicious commands into user-provided inputs that are used in deployment scripts or configuration files without proper sanitization. For example, if Coolify uses user-provided application names or environment variables in shell commands.
                *   **Template Injection:** Injecting code into template engines used to generate deployment scripts or configurations if user input is not properly escaped.

    **1.4. Insecure API Endpoints [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting API endpoints that are not properly secured, allowing unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** APIs often expose sensitive functionalities and data, making insecure endpoints a direct path to compromise.

            *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **Default Credential Login:** Attempting to log in using default administrator usernames and passwords that are set during Coolify installation if users fail to change them.
                *   **Brute-forcing Weak Defaults:** If default passwords are not truly default but are still weak or easily guessable, attackers might attempt to brute-force them.

    **3.2. Configuration Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Injecting malicious configurations into Coolify that affect either Coolify itself or the deployed applications.

*   **Description:** Targeting vulnerabilities arising from Coolify's use of Docker for containerization and deployment.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Docker is central to Coolify's functionality, and vulnerabilities in Docker practices can affect all deployed containers.

    **4.1. Vulnerable Base Images used by Coolify [HIGH RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Coolify using outdated or vulnerable base Docker images for building and deploying containers.

        *   **4.1.1. Coolify using outdated or vulnerable base Docker images for deployments [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **Exploiting Known Base Image Vulnerabilities:** Deploying applications using base images with publicly known vulnerabilities. Attackers can then target these vulnerabilities within the deployed containers.

        *   **4.1.2. Lack of regular updates and patching of base images by Coolify [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **Attack Vectors:**
                *   **Persistent Vulnerabilities:** If Coolify doesn't regularly update base images, deployed applications will remain vulnerable to known vulnerabilities in those base images over time.
