# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Coolify aims to simplify and streamline the process of deploying and managing web applications and databases on self-hosted infrastructure.
  - It targets developers and organizations seeking control over their deployment environment and data, offering an alternative to fully managed cloud platforms.
  - Key priorities likely include ease of use, broad compatibility with different technologies, and efficient resource utilization.
  - For a startup like Coolify, rapid user adoption and community growth are crucial for long-term success.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the platform could lead to data breaches or service disruptions, damaging user trust and hindering adoption.
  - Complexity in managing diverse deployment environments and technologies could lead to user frustration and churn.
  - Competition from established cloud providers and other self-hosting solutions could limit market share.
  - Lack of clear monetization strategy for an open-source project can impact long-term sustainability.
  - Reliance on community contributions for development and maintenance can introduce unpredictability and potential delays.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: HTTPS is enforced for web access, ensuring encrypted communication between users and the Coolify platform. (Implemented in web server configuration, likely Nginx or similar).
  - security control: Regular dependency updates are likely performed to address known vulnerabilities in underlying libraries and frameworks. (Part of standard software development practice).
  - security control: Input validation is expected to be implemented in the application code to prevent common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). (Implemented in application code).
  - security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is likely implemented to manage user permissions and access to different resources within the platform. (Implemented in application backend).
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, vulnerability disclosure and patching might be publicly visible, potentially giving attackers a window of opportunity.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on user-provided infrastructure introduces variability in security configurations and potential misconfigurations by users.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing by security professionals to identify and address security weaknesses in the platform.
  - security control: Implement a robust secrets management solution to securely store and manage sensitive credentials like API keys and database passwords.
  - security control: Provide security hardening guidelines and best practices for users deploying Coolify on their infrastructure.
  - security control: Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection to protect the platform from denial-of-service attacks.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure user authentication mechanism to verify user identity. (e.g., username/password, OAuth).
    - requirement: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be offered as an option to enhance account security.
    - requirement: Session management to securely maintain user sessions and prevent unauthorized access.
  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to resources.
    - requirement: Granular authorization policies to control access to specific functionalities and data.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege should be enforced, granting users only the necessary permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.).
    - requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to neutralize potentially malicious input.
    - requirement: Use of secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities related to input handling.
  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use of strong encryption algorithms for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - requirement: Secure storage and management of cryptographic keys.
    - requirement: Proper implementation of cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS for HTTPS).
    - requirement: Hashing and salting of passwords for secure password storage.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Application Deployment: The core functionality of Coolify is to enable users to deploy and manage their applications. Disruption of this process would directly impact users' ability to deploy and update their services.
  - Platform Management: Management of the Coolify platform itself, including user management, configuration, and monitoring, is critical for its operation and security.
  - Data Storage: The database storing Coolify's configuration and user data is crucial for platform functionality and user data integrity.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - User Credentials: Usernames, passwords (hashed), and API keys used for authentication and authorization are highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and deployed applications.
  - Application Configurations: Configurations for deployed applications, including environment variables, database connection strings, and deployment settings, can contain sensitive information.
  - Infrastructure Credentials: Credentials for accessing infrastructure providers (e.g., cloud provider API keys, server SSH keys) are highly sensitive and could lead to infrastructure compromise.
  - Application Data (Indirect): While Coolify itself might not directly store application data, it manages the deployment and infrastructure for applications that do. Therefore, vulnerabilities in Coolify could indirectly lead to exposure of application data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
