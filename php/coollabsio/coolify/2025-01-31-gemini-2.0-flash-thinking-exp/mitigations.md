# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for coollabsio/coolify

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Coolify Releases](./mitigation_strategies/verify_coolify_releases.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Before downloading a Coolify release (for initial installation or upgrade), navigate to the official Coolify releases page, typically on their GitHub repository or website.
    2.  Locate the specific release you intend to download.
    3.  Find the provided checksum (like SHA256) or digital signature for the release artifacts (e.g., `.tar.gz`, `.zip`). This information is usually provided alongside the download links.
    4.  Download the release artifact and the corresponding checksum/signature file.
    5.  Use a checksum verification tool (e.g., `sha256sum` on Linux/macOS, `CertUtil` on Windows) to calculate the checksum of the downloaded artifact.
    6.  Compare the calculated checksum with the official checksum provided by Coolify.
    7.  If the checksums match, the integrity of the downloaded release is verified. If they do not match, the release might be compromised, and you should not use it. Investigate the source and download again from the official source.
    8.  For signature verification, use a tool like `gpg` and Coolify's public key (if provided) to verify the digital signature of the release artifact.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Supply Chain Attack (High Severity): A malicious actor compromises the Coolify distribution channel and injects malware into the release binaries.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attack during Download (Medium Severity): An attacker intercepts the download process and replaces the legitimate Coolify release with a malicious version.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply Chain Attack: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of deploying compromised software from the outset.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attack during Download: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of compromised downloads, ensuring you are using the intended software.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of verifying software, but a formal, documented process for Coolify release verification is missing. Checksums are often available on GitHub releases, but not consistently used.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal documentation outlining the release verification process for developers and operations teams.
    *   Automated checks in deployment pipelines to verify release integrity before installation or upgrade.
    *   Training for developers and operations teams on how to perform release verification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Coolify](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_coolify.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Subscribe to Coolify's official communication channels for security announcements and release notes (e.g., their website, GitHub repository, mailing list, social media).
    2.  Establish a schedule for checking for Coolify updates (e.g., weekly or monthly).
    3.  When a new version is released, review the release notes to understand new features, bug fixes, and, most importantly, security patches.
    4.  Prioritize updates that address security vulnerabilities.
    5.  Plan and execute the update process according to Coolify's upgrade documentation. This usually involves downloading the new release and following specific upgrade steps.
    6.  After updating, thoroughly test Coolify and your deployed applications to ensure everything is working as expected and that the update did not introduce regressions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Coolify (High Severity): Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in older versions of Coolify to gain unauthorized access, control, or cause disruption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Coolify: High Risk Reduction - Directly addresses and eliminates known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the attack surface.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of updates, but a proactive and scheduled update process for Coolify is not formally established. Updates are often reactive, triggered by issues rather than proactive security maintenance.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal policy and schedule for regular Coolify updates.
    *   Automated notifications or alerts for new Coolify releases.
    *   Integration of Coolify update checks into system monitoring dashboards.
    *   Defined procedure for testing and rolling back updates if issues arise.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication and MFA for Coolify UI](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication_and_mfa_for_coolify_ui.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Implement password complexity requirements for all Coolify user accounts within Coolify's user management settings. Encourage or enforce the use of strong, unique passwords that are difficult to guess.
    2.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all Coolify user accounts, especially for administrative accounts, if Coolify offers this feature natively or through integrations.
        *   Choose an MFA method supported by Coolify or integrate with an external MFA provider (if possible). Common methods include Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) via apps like Google Authenticator or Authy, SMS codes (less secure), or hardware security keys.
        *   Document the MFA setup process for users within the context of Coolify.
        *   Provide recovery mechanisms in case users lose access to their MFA devices, considering Coolify's user management capabilities.
    3.  **Regular Password Rotation Policy (Consideration):** While debated, consider implementing a password rotation policy within Coolify's user management, especially for highly privileged accounts, if supported. However, prioritize strong, unique passwords and MFA over frequent rotation alone.
    4.  **Account Lockout Policy:** Implement an account lockout policy within Coolify's settings to automatically lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts to the Coolify UI. This helps prevent brute-force password attacks against Coolify accounts.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Password Attacks against Coolify UI (High Severity): Attackers attempt to guess user passwords for Coolify accounts through automated or manual brute-force attacks.
    *   Credential Stuffing against Coolify UI (High Severity): Attackers use stolen credentials from other breaches to attempt to log in to Coolify accounts.
    *   Phishing Attacks targeting Coolify UI Credentials (Medium Severity): Attackers trick users into revealing their Coolify UI passwords through phishing emails or websites. MFA significantly reduces the impact of compromised passwords from phishing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Password Attacks against Coolify UI: High Risk Reduction - Makes brute-force attacks significantly more difficult and time-consuming, often rendering them impractical.
    *   Credential Stuffing against Coolify UI: High Risk Reduction - Prevents attackers from using stolen credentials to gain access to Coolify, as they would also need the MFA factor.
    *   Phishing Attacks targeting Coolify UI Credentials: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the impact of phishing by requiring a second factor even if the Coolify UI password is compromised.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Strong password policies might be in place, but MFA is likely not enforced or even offered as a standard feature in default Coolify setups. Account lockout policies might also be missing or not configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enforced MFA for all Coolify user accounts, especially administrators, within Coolify's user management.
    *   Clear documentation and user guides on setting up and using MFA for Coolify UI access.
    *   Account lockout policy configuration within Coolify.
    *   Regular security awareness training for users on password security and phishing prevention specifically related to accessing Coolify UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Coolify](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__in_coolify.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles within Coolify:** Identify different user roles within your organization that will interact with Coolify (e.g., Administrator, Developer, Operator, Viewer) and map them to Coolify's available role definitions.
    2.  **Assign Permissions to Coolify Roles:** For each role within Coolify, define the specific permissions they need within the Coolify platform. Follow the principle of least privilege â€“ grant only the necessary permissions for each role to perform their tasks within Coolify. Examples of permissions within Coolify include:
        *   Project Management Permissions within Coolify
        *   Application Deployment/Management Permissions within Coolify
        *   Database Management Permissions within Coolify
        *   Log Viewing Permissions within Coolify
        *   User Management Permissions within Coolify
        *   Coolify Settings Configuration Permissions
    3.  **Assign Users to Coolify Roles:** Assign users to the appropriate roles within Coolify based on their responsibilities. Avoid granting administrative privileges within Coolify unnecessarily. Utilize Coolify's user management interface for role assignments.
    4.  **Regularly Review Coolify Roles and Permissions:** Periodically review the defined roles and permissions within Coolify to ensure they are still appropriate and aligned with organizational needs. Adjust roles and permissions within Coolify as needed using Coolify's administrative interface.
    5.  **Audit Coolify RBAC Configuration:** Regularly audit the RBAC configuration within Coolify to verify that users are assigned to the correct roles and that permissions are correctly configured within the Coolify platform.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access within Coolify (Medium Severity): Users with excessive privileges within Coolify can access and modify resources or perform actions beyond their intended scope within the Coolify platform, potentially leading to misconfigurations or service disruptions managed by Coolify.
    *   Insider Threats within Coolify (Medium Severity): Malicious or negligent insiders with overly broad access within Coolify can intentionally or unintentionally cause harm to the Coolify platform or managed applications.
    *   Accidental Misconfigurations within Coolify (Low Severity): Users with excessive permissions within Coolify might accidentally misconfigure settings or resources within Coolify, leading to unintended consequences in deployments or Coolify's operation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access within Coolify: Medium Risk Reduction - Limits the potential for unauthorized access within Coolify by restricting user permissions to only what is necessary within the platform.
    *   Insider Threats within Coolify: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the potential damage from insider threats within Coolify by limiting the scope of access for each user within the platform.
    *   Accidental Misconfigurations within Coolify: Low Risk Reduction - Minimizes the risk of accidental misconfigurations within Coolify by limiting the ability of users to modify critical settings within the platform.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented. Coolify likely has some basic user roles and permissions, but granular RBAC might not be fully configured or utilized. Default setups might grant overly broad permissions within Coolify.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Detailed definition and documentation of available Coolify roles and permissions.
    *   Clear process for assigning users to roles and managing permissions within Coolify.
    *   Regular audits of RBAC configuration within Coolify to ensure it is correctly implemented and maintained.
    *   Training for administrators on how to effectively utilize Coolify's RBAC features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Coolify Secrets Management](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_coolify_secrets_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets Managed by Coolify:** Identify all sensitive information (secrets) required by your applications and Coolify itself that can be managed through Coolify's secrets management features (e.g., API keys, database credentials, TLS certificates, environment variables containing sensitive data used in Coolify deployments).
    2.  **Store Secrets in Coolify Secrets Management:** Use Coolify's built-in secrets management features to store these secrets securely within Coolify. Avoid hardcoding secrets in application code, configuration files, or environment variables directly within Coolify deployment configurations.
    3.  **Access Secrets in Applications Deployed by Coolify:** Configure your applications deployed through Coolify to retrieve secrets from Coolify's secrets management system at runtime. Utilize Coolify's mechanisms to inject secrets into containers or applications securely (e.g., environment variables, mounted volumes as provided by Coolify).
    4.  **Regular Secrets Rotation within Coolify:** Implement a process for regularly rotating secrets managed by Coolify, especially for critical credentials, if Coolify's secrets management supports or facilitates secret rotation.
    5.  **Audit Secrets Access within Coolify:** Enable audit logging for secrets access within Coolify, if available, to track who accessed which secrets and when through Coolify. Monitor logs for suspicious access patterns within Coolify's secret management logs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Coolify Configurations (High Severity): Hardcoding secrets in Coolify deployment configurations or within Coolify's settings makes them easily discoverable and increases the risk of accidental exposure (e.g., through Coolify backups, or unauthorized access to Coolify's configuration).
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets Managed by Coolify (Medium Severity): If secrets managed by Coolify are not properly secured within Coolify, unauthorized users or processes might gain access to them through Coolify's interface or underlying storage.
    *   Stolen Credentials Managed by Coolify (High Severity): Exposed or poorly managed secrets within Coolify can be stolen by attackers and used to gain unauthorized access to systems and data managed or deployed by Coolify.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets in Coolify Configurations: High Risk Reduction - Eliminates the risk of hardcoded secrets in Coolify configurations by centralizing secret management within Coolify.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Secrets Managed by Coolify: Medium Risk Reduction - Improves control over secret access by using Coolify's dedicated secrets management system.
    *   Stolen Credentials Managed by Coolify: High Risk Reduction - Reduces the impact of stolen credentials by making it harder for attackers to find and exploit secrets managed by Coolify.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers might be aware of not hardcoding secrets, but consistent use of Coolify's secrets management for all sensitive information within Coolify deployments might be lacking. Some secrets might still be managed through less secure methods within Coolify configurations (e.g., environment variables directly in deployment configurations without using Coolify's secret management).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal policy and guidelines for using Coolify's secrets management for all sensitive data within Coolify deployments.
    *   Training for developers on how to use Coolify's secrets management effectively.
    *   Automated checks to prevent hardcoding of secrets in Coolify configurations.
    *   Implementation of secrets rotation processes within Coolify's secrets management.
    *   Audit logging and monitoring of secrets access within Coolify's secrets management features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Git Repository Access for Coolify Deployments](./mitigation_strategies/secure_git_repository_access_for_coolify_deployments.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Authentication for Git Repositories Used by Coolify:** Ensure that Git repositories accessed by Coolify for deployments are secured with strong authentication methods (e.g., SSH keys, strong passwords with MFA for web-based Git interfaces). Configure Coolify to use these secure authentication methods when connecting to Git repositories.
    2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Git Repositories Used by Coolify:** Implement RBAC in your Git repository hosting platform to control who can access and modify repositories used by Coolify. Grant Coolify's service accounts (see next step) only the necessary permissions (e.g., read-only access for deployment pipelines).
    3.  **Dedicated Service Accounts for Coolify Git Access:** Instead of using personal developer accounts within Coolify's Git integration settings, create dedicated service accounts with limited permissions specifically for Coolify to access Git repositories. Configure Coolify to use these dedicated service accounts for Git operations. These service accounts should only have the necessary permissions to clone repositories for deployment purposes initiated by Coolify.
    4.  **Regularly Review Git Access for Coolify:** Periodically review Git repository access permissions granted to Coolify's service accounts and ensure they are still appropriate and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Remove or adjust access as needed.
    5.  **Repository Scanning (Pre-commit/Pre-push Hooks - Related to Coolify Workflow):** While not directly a Coolify feature, encourage and implement pre-commit and pre-push hooks in your Git repositories to automatically scan code for secrets, vulnerabilities, and policy violations *before* code is pushed that Coolify might deploy. This helps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information in the repository that Coolify might then deploy.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Source Code Deployed by Coolify (High Severity): Attackers gain unauthorized access to the source code repository that Coolify uses for deployments, potentially exposing sensitive information, intellectual property, and vulnerabilities in applications deployed by Coolify.
    *   Code Tampering Affecting Coolify Deployments (High Severity): Attackers with write access to the repository can tamper with the source code, injecting malicious code or making unauthorized changes that could be deployed through Coolify, leading to compromised applications.
    *   Accidental Exposure of Secrets in Git Repositories Used by Coolify (Medium Severity): Developers might accidentally commit secrets or sensitive information to the Git repository that Coolify uses, making them accessible to anyone with repository access and potentially deployable by Coolify.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Source Code Deployed by Coolify: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by enforcing strong authentication and RBAC for Git repositories used by Coolify.
    *   Code Tampering Affecting Coolify Deployments: High Risk Reduction - Limits the ability of unauthorized individuals to tamper with the code deployed by Coolify by controlling write access to the repository.
    *   Accidental Exposure of Secrets in Git Repositories Used by Coolify: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of accidental secret exposure in repositories used by Coolify through repository scanning and developer awareness.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Strong authentication for Git is likely in place, but dedicated service accounts for Coolify and comprehensive RBAC for repositories *specifically for Coolify's access* might be missing. Pre-commit/pre-push hooks for security scanning are likely not implemented in the context of Coolify's deployment workflow.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of dedicated service accounts for Coolify Git access within Coolify's Git integration settings.
    *   Fine-grained RBAC configuration for Git repositories *specifically for Coolify's service accounts*.
    *   Guidance and integration points for implementing pre-commit and pre-push hooks for security scanning in Git repositories used with Coolify.
    *   Regular audits of Git repository access permissions granted to Coolify's service accounts.
    *   Training for developers on secure Git practices and avoiding accidental secret exposure in the context of Coolify deployments.
