# Threat Model Analysis for coollabsio/coolify

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Coolify Instance](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_coolify_instance.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Coolify web interface or API using stolen credentials, brute-force attacks, session hijacking, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the authentication mechanism. The attacker could then manage all resources controlled by Coolify.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over deployed applications, databases, and potentially the underlying servers. Data breaches, service disruption, lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Component Affected:** Coolify Authentication Module (login, session management, API key handling), User Management Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong password policies (length, complexity, expiration).
    *   Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.
    *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   Regularly review and update authentication mechanisms.
    *   Use secure session management practices (e.g., HTTPS-only cookies, short session timeouts).
    *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts and API requests.
    *   Monitor login logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Consider IP whitelisting for access to the Coolify interface, if feasible.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Coolify](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__in_coolify.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Coolify's code (e.g., in a parsing library, a form handler, or an API endpoint) to execute arbitrary code on the server running Coolify. This could be achieved through crafted input, malicious file uploads, or exploiting a dependency vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the Coolify server, allowing the attacker to access all data, modify configurations, and potentially compromise connected servers.
*   **Component Affected:** Potentially any component handling user input or external data, including: API endpoints, form processing logic, file upload handlers, internal libraries, and third-party dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data.
    *   Use a secure coding framework and follow secure coding practices.
    *   Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions.
    *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Run Coolify with the least necessary privileges.
    *   Use a containerized environment (e.g., Docker) to isolate Coolify from the host system.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Coolify](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_coolify.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with limited access to Coolify (e.g., a user with access to only one project) exploits a vulnerability to gain higher privileges (e.g., administrator access). This could be due to flaws in the authorization logic or improper handling of user roles.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to resources and functionalities beyond their intended permissions, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
*   **Component Affected:** Authorization Module, User Roles Management, API endpoints that handle permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege (users should only have access to the resources they need).
    *   Regularly review and audit user permissions.
    *   Thoroughly test authorization logic to prevent bypasses.
    *   Ensure that API endpoints properly enforce authorization checks.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Secrets](./threats/insecure_storage_of_secrets.md)

*   **Description:** Coolify stores sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, SSH keys) in plain text or using weak encryption. An attacker who gains access to the Coolify database or configuration files could retrieve these secrets.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of connected services (databases, Git repositories, cloud providers), allowing the attacker to access sensitive data or modify resources.
*   **Component Affected:** Secrets Management Module, Configuration File Handling, Database Schema.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables with strong encryption).
    *   Never store secrets directly in the codebase or configuration files.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    *   Regularly rotate secrets.
    *   Implement access control policies for secrets.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables.md)

*   **Description:** Coolify inadvertently exposes environment variables of deployed applications through logs, error messages, or the web interface.  An attacker could gain access to these variables, which often contain sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.
*   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information, potentially leading to compromise of the deployed application or connected services.
*   **Component Affected:** Application Deployment Module, Logging Module, Error Handling Logic, Web Interface components that display application information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review Coolify's handling of environment variables.
    *   Implement a mechanism to redact sensitive information from logs and error messages.
    *   Ensure that the web interface does not display sensitive environment variables.
    *   Use a secure mechanism for injecting environment variables into containers (e.g., Docker secrets).
    *   Educate users on the importance of not including sensitive information in non-secret environment variables.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Coolify uses insecure default configurations when deploying applications or databases (e.g., default passwords, open ports, unnecessary services enabled). An attacker could exploit these defaults to gain access to the deployed resources. *This threat is included because Coolify itself is providing these defaults.*
*   **Impact:** Deployed applications and databases are immediately vulnerable to attack.
*   **Component Affected:** Application Deployment Module, Database Provisioning Module, Default Configuration Templates.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Review and harden all default configurations.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all services.
    *   Disable unnecessary services and close unused ports.
    *   Use a secure-by-default approach for all deployments.
    *   Provide clear documentation on how to customize and secure deployments.
    *   Implement automated security checks to identify insecure configurations.

## Threat: [Weak SSH Key Management](./threats/weak_ssh_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** Coolify uses weak SSH keys, stores keys insecurely, or fails to rotate keys regularly. An attacker who obtains a compromised key could gain access to managed servers.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed servers, allowing the attacker to modify configurations, access data, or launch further attacks.
*   **Component Affected:** Server Management Module, SSH Key Storage, SSH Connection Handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong SSH key types (e.g., Ed25519).
    *   Store SSH keys securely (e.g., using a secrets management solution).
    *   Regularly rotate SSH keys.
    *   Implement SSH key management best practices (e.g., using passphrases, limiting key access).
    *   Monitor SSH logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Coolify](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_coolify.md)

* **Description:** Coolify itself relies on third-party libraries and frameworks. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise Coolify.
* **Impact:** Similar to RCE, but the entry point is through a vulnerable dependency.
* **Component Affected:** All components that use the vulnerable dependency.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update all dependencies to their latest secure versions.
    *   Use a dependency scanning tool (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to identify and track vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a process for promptly patching vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Consider using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool.
