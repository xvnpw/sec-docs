*   **Overall Description:**  This involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities within the Coolify application's source code or its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Dependency Vulnerabilities (Supply Chain Attacks) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_dependency_vulnerabilities__supply_chain_attacks___high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or packages used by Coolify.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Outdated/Vulnerable Node.js Packages (e.g., in package.json) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_outdatedvulnerable_node_js_packages__e_g___in_package_json___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers scan for outdated Node.js packages listed in `package.json` that have known vulnerabilities (CVEs).  They then exploit these vulnerabilities to gain code execution within the Coolify instance.

                    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (without proper auditing)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.2 Insecure Handling of Secrets/Credentials [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_2_insecure_handling_of_secretscredentials__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting weaknesses in how Coolify stores, manages, or transmits secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.).  This could involve finding hardcoded secrets, accessing unencrypted secrets, or intercepting secrets in transit.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on specific implementation flaws)
                    *   **Impact:** Very High
