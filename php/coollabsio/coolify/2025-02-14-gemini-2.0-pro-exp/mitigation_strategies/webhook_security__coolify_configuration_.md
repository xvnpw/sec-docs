# Deep Analysis: Webhook Security - Configure Webhook Secret in Coolify

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of configuring webhook secrets within Coolify to mitigate security threats related to unauthorized webhook invocations.  We aim to understand the implementation details, identify potential weaknesses, and ensure that the proposed mitigation strategy is robustly implemented and tested.  This analysis will provide actionable recommendations to the development team.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Configure Webhook Secret in Coolify" mitigation strategy, as described in the provided document.  The scope includes:

*   **Coolify's Webhook Handling:**  How Coolify processes incoming webhook requests, including signature verification logic.
*   **Git Provider Integration:**  The interaction between Coolify and the Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) regarding webhook secrets.
*   **Testing Procedures:**  Both positive (valid webhook) and negative (forged/invalid webhook) testing methodologies.
*   **Threat Model:**  Specifically addressing the threats of forged webhook requests and replay attacks.
*   **Implementation Status:**  Evaluating the current state of implementation and identifying gaps.
* **Coolify version:** Analysis is done on latest stable version of Coolify.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other security aspects of Coolify beyond webhook security.
*   The security of the Git provider itself.
*   Network-level security controls (e.g., firewalls) that might impact webhook delivery.

## 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be used for this deep analysis:

1.  **Code Review (if possible):**  Examine the relevant sections of the Coolify codebase (if open-source and accessible) responsible for handling webhooks and verifying signatures. This is crucial for understanding the *exact* verification algorithm used.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review Coolify's official documentation related to webhook configuration and security.
3.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Inspect the configuration options within Coolify related to webhooks and secrets.
4.  **Testing:**  Perform hands-on testing, including:
    *   **Positive Testing:**  Configure a webhook with a valid secret and trigger events to ensure proper functionality.
    *   **Negative Testing:**  Attempt to trigger webhook actions with:
        *   No signature.
        *   An incorrect signature.
        *   A replayed signature (if possible, to test for replay protection).
    *   **Edge Case Testing:** Test with unusual characters in the secret, very long secrets, etc.
5.  **Threat Modeling:**  Revisit the threat model (forged requests, replay attacks) and assess the effectiveness of the mitigation strategy against each threat.
6.  **Documentation of Findings:**  Clearly document all findings, including any identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
7.  **Recommendations:**  Provide specific, actionable recommendations to improve the security of Coolify's webhook handling.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Configure Webhook Secret

**4.1.  Mechanism of Action**

The core principle of this mitigation is to leverage cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity of incoming webhook requests.  Here's how it works (in general, and how it *should* work in Coolify):

1.  **Shared Secret:**  A secret string is generated by the Git provider and shared with Coolify. This secret should be treated as highly sensitive and stored securely.
2.  **Signature Generation (Git Provider):**  When a webhook event occurs (e.g., a push), the Git provider:
    *   Constructs the payload (the data describing the event).
    *   Calculates a cryptographic hash (usually HMAC-SHA256, but could be others) of the payload, using the shared secret as the key.
    *   Includes this hash (the "signature") in the webhook request headers (e.g., `X-Hub-Signature-256` for GitHub).
3.  **Signature Verification (Coolify):**  When Coolify receives a webhook request:
    *   Retrieves the signature from the request headers.
    *   Retrieves the shared secret from its secure storage.
    *   Independently calculates the hash of the received payload using the same algorithm and the shared secret.
    *   Compares the calculated hash with the received signature.  If they match, the request is considered authentic.  If they don't match, the request is rejected.

**4.2. Threat Mitigation Analysis**

*   **Forged Webhook Requests (High Severity):**  This mitigation strategy *directly* addresses this threat.  Without the correct shared secret, an attacker cannot generate a valid signature.  Therefore, Coolify *should* reject any forged requests.  The effectiveness hinges on:
    *   **Coolify's Correct Implementation:**  Coolify *must* correctly implement the signature verification algorithm.  Any errors in this logic could create a vulnerability.
    *   **Secret Confidentiality:**  The shared secret must remain confidential.  If it's compromised, the entire mechanism is defeated.
    *   **Algorithm Strength:** The hashing algorithm used (e.g., HMAC-SHA256) must be cryptographically strong.

*   **Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):**  The basic webhook secret mechanism *does not inherently prevent replay attacks*.  A replay attack involves an attacker capturing a valid webhook request (including the signature) and re-sending it later.  To mitigate replay attacks:
    *   **Timestamping and Nonces:**  The Git provider might include a timestamp or a unique nonce (number used once) in the payload.  Coolify would then need to:
        *   Verify that the timestamp is within an acceptable window (to prevent old requests from being replayed).
        *   Track nonces and reject requests with duplicate nonces.
    *   **Idempotency:**  Coolify's webhook handling logic should ideally be idempotent.  This means that processing the same webhook request multiple times should have the same effect as processing it once.  This reduces the impact of replay attacks, even if they are not completely prevented.

**4.3. Implementation Status and Gaps**

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Coolify *can* receive webhooks, but the secret is *not* configured. This means Coolify is currently vulnerable to forged webhook requests.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Secret Configuration:**  The crucial missing step is entering the webhook secret from the Git provider into Coolify's settings.
    *   **Testing:**  No testing (positive or negative) has been performed.  This is a critical gap.  We *must* verify that Coolify correctly rejects invalid signatures.
    * **Replay attack mitigation:** There is no information, if replay attack mitigation is implemented.

**4.4. Potential Weaknesses and Concerns**

*   **Incorrect Signature Verification Logic:**  This is the most significant potential weakness.  Errors in Coolify's code could lead to false positives (rejecting valid requests) or, more seriously, false negatives (accepting forged requests).
*   **Weak Hashing Algorithm:**  If Coolify uses a weak or outdated hashing algorithm, the signatures could be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks.
*   **Lack of Replay Protection:**  If Coolify doesn't implement any replay protection mechanisms, it remains vulnerable to replay attacks.
*   **Secret Storage:**  How Coolify stores the webhook secret is crucial.  It should be stored securely, encrypted at rest, and protected from unauthorized access.
*   **Error Handling:**  How Coolify handles errors during signature verification is important.  It should not leak any information that could be useful to an attacker.  It should log errors securely for debugging purposes.
* **Secret Rotation:** There is no information about secret rotation procedures.

**4.5.  Testing Plan (Detailed)**

The following tests *must* be performed:

1.  **Positive Test (Valid Signature):**
    *   Configure a webhook in the Git provider and Coolify with a valid secret.
    *   Trigger a webhook event (e.g., push a commit).
    *   Verify that Coolify processes the event correctly.

2.  **Negative Tests (Invalid Signatures):**
    *   **No Signature:**  Send a webhook request without any signature header.  Coolify should reject it.
    *   **Incorrect Signature:**  Send a webhook request with a deliberately incorrect signature (e.g., a random string).  Coolify should reject it.
    *   **Modified Payload:**  Send a webhook request with a valid signature, but modify the payload *after* the signature was generated.  Coolify should reject it.
    *   **Different Algorithm:** If the Git provider supports multiple signature algorithms, try sending a request with a different algorithm than the one configured in Coolify. Coolify should reject it.

3.  **Replay Attack Test (if possible):**
    *   Capture a valid webhook request (including headers and payload).
    *   Re-send the *exact same* request.
    *   If Coolify has replay protection, it should reject the second request.  If it doesn't, it will likely process the request again (which highlights the need for idempotency).

4.  **Edge Case Tests:**
    *   Test with a very long secret.
    *   Test with a secret containing special characters.
    *   Test with an empty secret (Coolify should reject this configuration).

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Action:**  Configure the webhook secret in Coolify *immediately*. This is the highest priority.
2.  **Thorough Testing:**  Perform *all* the tests outlined in the Testing Plan above.  Document the results of each test.
3.  **Code Review:**  If possible, conduct a code review of Coolify's webhook handling logic, focusing on signature verification.
4.  **Replay Protection:**  Investigate and implement replay protection mechanisms (timestamping/nonces or idempotency).
5.  **Secure Secret Storage:**  Ensure that Coolify stores the webhook secret securely.
6.  **Documentation:**  Update Coolify's documentation to clearly explain the importance of webhook secrets and the steps for configuring them. Include information about replay protection.
7.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Include webhook security as part of regular security audits of Coolify.
8. **Secret Rotation:** Implement secret rotation procedures.

## 6. Conclusion

Configuring webhook secrets in Coolify is a *critical* security measure to prevent forged webhook requests.  However, the effectiveness of this mitigation depends entirely on the correct implementation and thorough testing.  The identified gaps (lack of secret configuration and testing) must be addressed immediately.  Furthermore, exploring and implementing replay protection is strongly recommended to enhance the overall security of Coolify's webhook handling. By following these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized deployments and other malicious actions triggered by forged webhooks.
