## Mitigation Strategy: [Restricted Network Access to Coolify's API and UI (Coolify Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/restricted_network_access_to_coolify's_api_and_ui__coolify_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Coolify's Built-in Network Restrictions (if available)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Coolify Settings:** Log in to Coolify as an administrator and navigate to the network settings, security settings, or a similar section.
    2.  **Check for Built-in Restrictions:** Look for options to restrict access to the Coolify UI and API based on IP address or network range.  This might be labeled as "Allowed IPs," "Trusted Networks," "Access Control List," or similar.
    3.  **Configure Allowed IPs/Networks:** If these settings are available, enter the specific IP addresses or network ranges from which administrators and developers should be allowed to access Coolify.
    4.  **Test Access:** After configuring the restrictions, test access from both allowed and disallowed locations to ensure they are working as expected.
    5.  **Regularly Review:** Periodically review these settings to ensure they remain accurate and reflect any changes in access requirements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from directly accessing the Coolify dashboard and API.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):** Limits the attack surface for brute-force attempts.
    *   **Exploitation of Web Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Reduces exposure to web vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (effectiveness depends on Coolify's implementation).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **Exploitation of Web Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced moderately.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Checked Coolify settings; no built-in IP restriction features are found.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   This strategy relies on Coolify having built-in features. Since they are missing, external network restrictions (firewall, VPN) are the primary mitigation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege for Service Accounts (Coolify Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_for_service_accounts__coolify_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Coolify's Service Account Management (if available)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Coolify Settings:** Log in to Coolify as an administrator and navigate to the service account management, integration settings, or a similar section.
    2.  **Review Existing Accounts:** Examine the existing service accounts or API keys that Coolify uses to interact with external services (cloud providers, Docker, etc.).
    3.  **Use Coolify's Features (If Available):** If Coolify provides features to create and manage separate service accounts with granular permissions, use them. This might involve:
        *   Creating new service accounts within Coolify.
        *   Assigning specific roles or permissions to these accounts within Coolify's interface.
        *   Configuring Coolify to use different service accounts for different tasks (e.g., database provisioning, server deployment).
    4.  **Configure API Keys/Credentials:** If Coolify relies on manually configured API keys or credentials, ensure these are generated with the *minimum* necessary permissions.
    5.  **Regularly Review:** Periodically review the service accounts and their permissions within Coolify to ensure they remain appropriate.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Limits the impact of a compromised Coolify component.
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the potential damage from malicious insiders.
    *   **Compromise of Coolify Instance (Severity: Critical):** Limits the blast radius.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction depends heavily on Coolify's implementation.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduction depends on the granularity of Coolify's permissions.
    *   **Compromise of Coolify Instance:** Risk reduction depends on Coolify's features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Coolify is using a single, manually configured API key for the cloud provider.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Coolify's built-in service account management features (if they exist) are not being utilized to their full potential.
    *   Granular permissions within Coolify are not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Secrets (Coolify Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_secrets__coolify_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Properly Use Coolify's Built-in Secrets Management

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Coolify's Secrets Management:** Log in to Coolify and navigate to the secrets management section (often within project or environment settings).
    2.  **Use Built-in Features:** *Always* use Coolify's built-in secrets management features to store sensitive data (API keys, database passwords, etc.).  *Never* store secrets directly in application code or in environment variables that are *not* managed by Coolify.
    3.  **Understand Limitations:** Be aware of the limitations of Coolify's built-in secrets management.  It might not offer the same level of security as a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., encryption at rest, detailed audit logs, automatic rotation).
    4.  **Configure Access Control (If Available):** If Coolify provides options to control which users or teams can access specific secrets, use them to limit access based on the principle of least privilege.
    5.  **Regularly Review Secrets:** Periodically review the secrets stored in Coolify to ensure they are still needed and that their values are up to date.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of secrets being exposed through application code or configuration files.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets (Severity: Critical):** Limits access to secrets within Coolify (if access control features are available).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secrets Exposure:** Risk reduced moderately (compared to storing secrets insecurely).  The level of protection depends on Coolify's implementation.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets:** Risk reduction depends on Coolify's access control features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Applications are using Coolify's built-in secrets management for some secrets.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Some secrets are still stored directly in environment variables outside of Coolify's management.
    *   Coolify's access control features for secrets (if available) are not being used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Webhook Security (Coolify Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/webhook_security__coolify_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Webhook Secret in Coolify

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain Webhook Secret:** Obtain the webhook secret from your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
    2.  **Access Coolify Settings:** Log in to Coolify and navigate to the settings for your source, project, or application â€“ wherever webhooks are configured.
    3.  **Enter Webhook Secret:** Locate the field for entering the webhook secret and paste the secret from your Git provider.
    4.  **Save Changes:** Save the changes to your Coolify configuration.
    5.  **Test Webhook Verification:** Test the webhook configuration by triggering a webhook event (e.g., pushing a commit) and verifying that Coolify processes it correctly. Also, try sending a *fake* webhook request with an invalid signature to ensure that Coolify rejects it (this is crucial).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Forged Webhook Requests (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from triggering unauthorized deployments.
    *   **Replay Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Some verification mechanisms include replay protection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Forged Webhook Requests:** Risk reduced significantly (assuming Coolify correctly verifies signatures).
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduction depends on Coolify's implementation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Coolify is configured to receive webhooks, but the secret is not configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The webhook secret from the Git provider is not entered into Coolify's settings.
    *   Testing of webhook verification (both positive and negative cases) has not been performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies and MFA for Coolify Users (Coolify Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_and_mfa_for_coolify_users__coolify_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Coolify's Authentication Settings

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Coolify Settings:** Log in to Coolify as an administrator and navigate to the user management, security, or authentication settings.

        *   Password history.
        *   Password expiration.
    3.  **Enable MFA (If Available):** If Coolify supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), enable it. Look for options to integrate with TOTP authenticator apps or other MFA methods.
    4.  **Enforce MFA (If Available):** If possible, make MFA *mandatory* for all Coolify users, especially administrators.
    5.  **Account Lockout (If Available):** Configure account lockout policies to temporarily disable accounts after multiple failed login attempts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: High):** Strong passwords and MFA make brute-force attacks much harder.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (Severity: High):** MFA prevents the use of stolen credentials.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized access to Coolify accounts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduction depends on the strength of the configured password policy and the availability of MFA.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk reduction depends on the availability and enforcement of MFA.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction depends on the overall strength of authentication settings.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A basic password policy (minimum length) is configured in Coolify.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   MFA is not enabled or enforced (if available in Coolify).
    *   The password policy does not enforce complexity, history, or expiration.
    *   Account lockout policies are not configured (if available in Coolify).
