# Deep Analysis: Improper Access Control to API Endpoints (Authorization Bypass) in Coolify

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to improper access control on Coolify's API endpoints.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses that could allow an attacker to bypass authorization checks and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks and enhance the security posture of Coolify deployments.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects of Coolify:

*   **API Endpoints:**  All publicly exposed and internally used API endpoints within the Coolify application.  This includes, but is not limited to, endpoints related to:
    *   User management (creation, modification, deletion)
    *   Resource management (servers, databases, applications)
    *   Deployment management (starting, stopping, updating deployments)
    *   Configuration management (changing settings, secrets)
    *   Webhooks and integrations
*   **Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:**  The methods used by Coolify to authenticate users and authorize access to API endpoints. This includes:
    *   JWT (JSON Web Token) handling (if used)
    *   Session management
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
    *   API key management (if used)
*   **Code Review (Targeted):**  We will perform a targeted code review of relevant sections of the Coolify codebase (specifically focusing on authorization logic and API endpoint handlers) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will *not* be a full codebase audit.
*   **Deployment Configuration:**  We will consider how common deployment configurations (e.g., reverse proxy setups, network policies) might impact the vulnerability of API endpoints.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Attacks that do not directly target API authorization bypass (e.g., DDoS, XSS on the UI).
*   Vulnerabilities in underlying infrastructure (e.g., the operating system, container runtime) unless they directly contribute to API authorization bypass.
*   A full penetration test of a live Coolify instance (although findings may inform future penetration testing).

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to systematically identify potential threats related to API authorization bypass.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  We will examine the Coolify source code (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the implementation of authentication and authorization logic.  We will focus on:
    *   API endpoint definitions and associated handlers.
    *   Middleware or functions responsible for authentication and authorization checks.
    *   RBAC implementation and permission checks.
    *   JWT validation and handling (if applicable).
    *   Error handling related to authorization failures.
3.  **Documentation Review:**  We will review Coolify's official documentation to understand the intended security model and identify any potential gaps or inconsistencies.
4.  **Hypothetical Attack Scenario Development:**  We will construct realistic attack scenarios based on identified vulnerabilities and assess their potential impact.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  For each identified vulnerability, we will provide specific, actionable recommendations for mitigation.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2.1 Improper Access Control to API Endpoints

### 2.1 Threat Modeling (STRIDE)

Applying STRIDE to this specific attack path:

*   **Spoofing:**  An attacker might attempt to impersonate a legitimate user or service by forging JWTs, manipulating session cookies, or providing false credentials.
*   **Tampering:**  An attacker might modify API requests (e.g., changing user IDs, role parameters) to bypass authorization checks.
*   **Repudiation:**  If API requests are not properly logged with sufficient detail, it may be difficult to trace unauthorized actions back to the attacker.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Successful authorization bypass could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as user data, configuration details, or application source code.  Error messages might also leak information about the authorization logic.
*   **Denial of Service:**  While not the primary focus, an attacker might exploit authorization bypass vulnerabilities to trigger resource-intensive operations, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:**  This is the core threat.  An attacker gains access to API endpoints and functionality that they should not have, effectively elevating their privileges within the Coolify system.

### 2.2 Code Review (Hypothetical Examples & Areas of Concern)

Since we don't have the exact code in front of us, we'll outline areas of concern and hypothetical examples based on common vulnerabilities in API authorization:

**2.2.1 Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

*   **Problem:**  The RBAC system might be too coarse-grained, granting users more permissions than necessary.  For example, a "developer" role might have access to modify production deployments, which should be restricted to an "administrator" role.
*   **Hypothetical Code (Vulnerable):**

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical API endpoint handler
    async function updateDeployment(req, res) {
      if (req.user.role === 'developer' || req.user.role === 'administrator') {
        // Update the deployment...
        res.status(200).send('Deployment updated');
      } else {
        res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
      }
    }
    ```
    In this example, both 'developer' and 'administrator' roles can update deployments.  If the intention is to restrict this to administrators only, this is a vulnerability.

*   **Mitigation:**  Implement a fine-grained RBAC system with clearly defined roles and permissions.  Ensure that each API endpoint checks for the *minimum* required permissions, not just a general role.

**2.2.2 Missing Permission Checks**

*   **Problem:**  An API endpoint might fail to check if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.  This is especially common when new features are added or existing code is refactored.
*   **Hypothetical Code (Vulnerable):**

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical API endpoint handler
    async function deleteServer(req, res) {
      // Authentication check (but no authorization check!)
      if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        // Delete the server...
        res.status(200).send('Server deleted');
      } else {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
      }
    }
    ```
    Here, any authenticated user can delete a server, regardless of their role or permissions.

*   **Mitigation:**  Implement explicit permission checks for *every* API endpoint and action.  Use a consistent authorization framework or library to avoid inconsistencies.

**2.2.3 Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**

*   **Problem:**  An attacker can manipulate parameters in the API request (e.g., user IDs, resource IDs) to access objects they should not have access to.
*   **Hypothetical Code (Vulnerable):**

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical API endpoint handler
    async function getUserDetails(req, res) {
      const userId = req.params.userId; // Directly from the request
      const user = await db.getUserById(userId);
      res.status(200).json(user);
    }
    ```
    An attacker could change the `userId` in the request to access the details of any user.

*   **Mitigation:**  Never directly expose internal object identifiers.  Use indirect references (e.g., UUIDs) or implement access control checks to verify that the authenticated user has permission to access the requested object.  For example:

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical API endpoint handler (Mitigated)
    async function getUserDetails(req, res) {
      const userId = req.params.userId;
      const user = await db.getUserById(userId);

      // Check if the requesting user has permission to access this user's details
      if (req.user.id === user.id || req.user.role === 'administrator') {
        res.status(200).json(user);
      } else {
        res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
      }
    }
    ```

**2.2.4 JWT Vulnerabilities (If Applicable)**

*   **Problem:**  If Coolify uses JWTs for authentication, vulnerabilities could arise from:
    *   **Weak Signing Key:**  Using a weak or easily guessable secret key to sign JWTs.
    *   **Algorithm Confusion:**  Failing to properly validate the signing algorithm (e.g., accepting "none" as a valid algorithm).
    *   **Missing Expiration Check:**  Not verifying the `exp` claim in the JWT, allowing expired tokens to be used.
    *   **"kid" Injection:**  If the `kid` (key ID) header is used, an attacker might be able to inject their own key.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a strong, randomly generated secret key (at least 256 bits).
    *   Enforce a specific signing algorithm (e.g., HS256, RS256).
    *   Always validate the `exp`, `iat`, and `nbf` claims.
    *   Properly sanitize and validate the `kid` header, if used.  Ideally, use a whitelist of allowed key IDs.

**2.2.5  Improper Error Handling**

* **Problem:**  Error messages returned by the API might reveal information about the authorization logic or internal system state.  For example, an error message like "User does not have permission to access resource X" leaks information about the existence of resource X.
* **Mitigation:**  Return generic error messages to the client (e.g., "Unauthorized" or "Forbidden").  Log detailed error information internally for debugging purposes.

**2.2.6  Missing or Inconsistent Authorization Logic in Webhooks/Integrations**

* **Problem:** If Coolify uses webhooks or integrates with other services, the authorization logic for these interactions might be weaker or missing altogether.
* **Mitigation:**  Ensure that all webhooks and integrations have proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.  Use API keys, signatures, or other security measures to verify the authenticity and integrity of incoming requests.

### 2.3 Hypothetical Attack Scenarios

1.  **Scenario 1: IDOR to Access Another User's Data:** An attacker registers a new user account.  They then intercept an API request to retrieve their own user details and modify the `userId` parameter to the ID of another user.  If the API endpoint is vulnerable to IDOR, the attacker will receive the other user's data.

2.  **Scenario 2: Role Escalation:** An attacker with a low-privilege role (e.g., "viewer") discovers an API endpoint that is supposed to be restricted to administrators.  They craft a request to this endpoint and, due to missing permission checks, successfully execute the action (e.g., creating a new server, deleting a database).

3.  **Scenario 3: JWT Manipulation:** An attacker obtains a valid JWT (e.g., by sniffing network traffic).  They discover that the JWT is signed with a weak key.  They use a tool like `jwt_tool` to crack the key and then forge a new JWT with elevated privileges (e.g., an "administrator" role).

### 2.4 Mitigation Recommendations (General)

1.  **Implement a Robust Authorization Framework:** Use a well-established authorization library or framework (e.g., Casbin, Oso) to ensure consistent and secure authorization checks across all API endpoints.

2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.  Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.

4.  **Secure JWT Handling (If Applicable):** Follow best practices for JWT security, including using strong keys, validating all claims, and enforcing a specific signing algorithm.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.

6.  **Detailed Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging of all API requests, including authentication and authorization events.  Monitor logs for suspicious activity.

7.  **Secure Development Practices:** Train developers on secure coding practices and incorporate security considerations throughout the software development lifecycle.

8.  **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update all dependencies (including libraries and frameworks) to patch known vulnerabilities.

9. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.

10. **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against authorization bypass attacks. This includes network security measures (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems) in addition to application-level security.

## 3. Conclusion

Improper access control to API endpoints is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences. By addressing the potential weaknesses outlined in this analysis and implementing the recommended mitigations, the security posture of Coolify deployments can be significantly improved.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and a commitment to secure development practices are essential for maintaining a strong defense against authorization bypass attacks.
