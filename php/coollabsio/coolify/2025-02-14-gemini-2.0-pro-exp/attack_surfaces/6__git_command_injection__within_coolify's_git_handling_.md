Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the Git Command Injection attack surface within Coolify.

## Deep Analysis: Git Command Injection in Coolify

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Git command injection vulnerabilities within Coolify, identify specific areas of concern, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate these risks.  We aim to move beyond a general understanding and pinpoint potential vulnerabilities in Coolify's codebase and operational procedures.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on attack surface #6: Git Command Injection, as described in the provided document.  The scope includes:

*   All Coolify code (primarily server-side) that interacts with Git repositories, including but not limited to:
    *   Cloning repositories.
    *   Fetching updates.
    *   Checking out branches/tags/commits.
    *   Listing branches.
    *   Any other Git operations triggered by user actions or automated processes.
*   User input fields and API endpoints that accept data related to Git repositories (URLs, branch names, commit hashes, etc.).
*   Configuration settings related to Git repository access (e.g., authentication methods, allowed hosts).
*   Error handling and logging related to Git operations.
*   The interaction between Coolify and any underlying Git libraries or system calls.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will manually inspect the Coolify codebase (available on GitHub) to identify instances where Git commands are constructed and executed.  We will pay close attention to how user input is handled and incorporated into these commands.  We will use tools like `grep`, `rg` (ripgrep), and potentially static analysis security tools (SAST) to aid in this process.  The focus will be on identifying patterns known to be vulnerable to command injection.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Penetration Testing):**  While a full penetration test is outside the immediate scope, we will outline potential fuzzing strategies that could be used to test for vulnerabilities.  This involves crafting malicious inputs and observing Coolify's behavior.

3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attack scenarios and how an attacker might exploit potential vulnerabilities.  This will help us prioritize mitigation efforts.

4.  **Best Practices Review:** We will compare Coolify's Git handling practices against established security best practices for interacting with Git programmatically.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Based on the provided description and the nature of Git command injection, here's a breakdown of the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities:

**2.1.  Potential Vulnerability Points (Code Review Focus):**

*   **Direct Command Construction:** The most critical vulnerability pattern is the direct concatenation of user-supplied strings into Git commands.  Examples (in pseudocode, adapting to Coolify's likely language - likely JavaScript/Node.js or Go):

    ```javascript
    // VULNERABLE:
    let repoURL = req.body.repoURL; // User-supplied URL
    let command = `git clone ${repoURL}`;
    exec(command);

    // VULNERABLE:
    let branchName = req.query.branch; // User-supplied branch
    let command = `git checkout ${branchName}`;
    exec(command);
    ```
    Any code resembling this pattern is highly suspect.  We need to find all instances of `exec`, `spawn`, `system`, or similar functions that execute shell commands, and trace back how the command string is built.

*   **Indirect Command Injection:**  Even if a Git library is used, vulnerabilities can exist if the library itself is misused or has its own vulnerabilities.  For example, some libraries might have options or parameters that, if controlled by an attacker, could lead to command execution.  We need to examine the specific Git library used by Coolify and its documentation for potential security issues.

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** Even with parameterized commands, weak input validation can lead to bypasses.  For example, if only basic checks are performed (e.g., checking for the presence of "http://" in a URL), an attacker might be able to craft a URL that still triggers unintended behavior.  Examples of malicious inputs:

    *   `http://example.com; rm -rf /` (classic command injection)
    *   `git@evil.com:repo.git` (using a different protocol)
    *   `http://example.com/repo.git#;[command]` (using URL fragments)
    *   `http://example.com/repo.git --upload-pack=[command]` (using Git options)
    *   `http://example.com/repo.git -c core.sshCommand="[command]"` (configuring Git options)
    *   `branch;[command]` (injecting into branch name)
    *   `../../../../../../etc/passwd` (path traversal, may not be directly command injection, but still dangerous)

    We need to identify all input validation routines and assess their effectiveness against these types of attacks.  Regular expressions should be carefully scrutinized for correctness and completeness.

*   **Error Handling:**  Poor error handling can leak information about the system or even lead to vulnerabilities.  If Git commands fail, the error messages should be carefully sanitized before being displayed to the user or logged.  Error messages might reveal internal paths, command structures, or other sensitive information.

*   **Git Configuration:**  Coolify's Git configuration (both globally and for specific repositories) should be reviewed.  Settings like `core.sshCommand` or custom hooks could be abused if an attacker can influence them.

**2.2.  Attack Scenarios (Threat Modeling):**

1.  **Public Repository Cloning:** An attacker provides a malicious repository URL to a public repository cloning feature.  The URL contains injected commands that are executed when Coolify attempts to clone the repository.

2.  **Private Repository Access:** An attacker gains access to a private repository's credentials (e.g., through phishing or a separate vulnerability).  They then use these credentials with a malicious URL to inject commands.

3.  **Branch/Tag Manipulation:** An attacker provides a malicious branch or tag name that, when checked out or listed, triggers command execution.

4.  **Webhook Exploitation:** If Coolify uses Git webhooks, an attacker might be able to inject commands through the webhook payload if the payload is not properly validated.

5.  **Configuration Manipulation:** An attacker gains access to Coolify's configuration (e.g., through a separate vulnerability) and modifies Git-related settings to enable command injection.

**2.3.  Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing Strategies):**

Fuzzing would involve sending a large number of variations of malicious inputs to Coolify's API endpoints and observing the results.  Here are some specific fuzzing strategies:

*   **URL Fuzzing:**  Fuzz the repository URL field with various combinations of:
    *   Valid URL prefixes (`http://`, `https://`, `git://`, `ssh://`)
    *   Special characters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `(`, `)`, `` ` ``, `\`, `"`, `'`, `<`, `>`, `#`, ` `, `\t`, `\n`, `\r`)
    *   Git-specific options (`--upload-pack`, `-c`, etc.)
    *   Long strings
    *   Unicode characters
    *   Encoded characters (%-encoding, URL encoding)

*   **Branch Name Fuzzing:** Fuzz the branch name field with similar variations as above.

*   **Commit Hash Fuzzing:**  While less likely to be directly vulnerable to command injection, fuzzing commit hashes might reveal other issues.

*   **Header Fuzzing:** If Coolify uses custom HTTP headers related to Git operations, fuzz these headers as well.

*   **Automated Fuzzing Tools:** Tools like Burp Suite Intruder, OWASP ZAP, or specialized fuzzers (e.g., `ffuf`) can be used to automate the fuzzing process.

**2.4.  Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

*   **Parameterized Git Libraries (Primary Defense):**  The most crucial mitigation is to *never* construct Git commands as strings.  Instead, use a well-vetted, parameterized Git library that handles command construction and escaping internally.  Examples:

    *   **Node.js:**  `simple-git`, `nodegit` (though `nodegit` is more complex).  *Always* use the parameterized API functions provided by these libraries.  Avoid any functions that directly execute shell commands.
    *   **Go:**  `go-git`.  Similar to Node.js, use the library's API functions for all Git operations.
    *   **Python:** `GitPython`.

    Example (using `simple-git` in Node.js):

    ```javascript
    // SAFE:
    const simpleGit = require('simple-git');
    const git = simpleGit();

    async function cloneRepo(repoURL, destination) {
        try {
            await git.clone(repoURL, destination); // Parameterized
            console.log('Repository cloned successfully.');
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error cloning repository:', error);
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Strict Input Validation (Defense in Depth):**  Even with parameterized libraries, implement rigorous input validation as a second layer of defense.  This should include:

    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and patterns for repository URLs, branch names, etc.  Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.  This is far more secure than a blacklist approach.
    *   **Regular Expressions (Carefully Crafted):**  Use regular expressions to enforce the whitelist.  Ensure the regular expressions are:
        *   **Anchored:**  Use `^` and `$` to match the entire string, not just a part of it.
        *   **Specific:**  Avoid overly broad patterns like `.*`.
        *   **Tested:**  Thoroughly test the regular expressions against both valid and invalid inputs.
        *   **Non-backtracking:** Avoid regular expressions that can lead to catastrophic backtracking (ReDoS).
    *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce reasonable length limits on all inputs.
    *   **Format Validation:**  Validate the format of URLs using a dedicated URL parsing library.
    *   **Protocol Restriction:** If possible, restrict the allowed protocols (e.g., only allow `https://` for public repositories).

*   **Least Privilege:**  Run Coolify with the least privileges necessary.  Do not run it as root.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve command execution.

*   **Sandboxing/Containerization:**  Run Coolify within a container (e.g., Docker) or a sandbox to isolate it from the host system.  This further limits the impact of a successful attack.

*   **Regular Audits and Updates:**  Regularly audit the codebase for Git-related vulnerabilities.  Keep the Git library and any other dependencies up to date to patch known security issues.

*   **Security Training:**  Ensure all developers working on Coolify are trained in secure coding practices, specifically regarding command injection and Git security.

*   **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Consider using a WAF to help block malicious requests before they reach Coolify.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

Git command injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.  Coolify's reliance on Git operations makes it a prime target for this type of attack.  The primary recommendation is to immediately refactor any code that constructs Git commands using string concatenation.  Replace these with parameterized Git library calls.  Implement strict input validation using a whitelist approach.  Regular security audits, developer training, and the use of sandboxing/containerization are also essential.  By implementing these mitigations, Coolify can significantly reduce its risk of Git command injection vulnerabilities. The fuzzing strategies outlined above should be incorporated into a regular security testing process.
