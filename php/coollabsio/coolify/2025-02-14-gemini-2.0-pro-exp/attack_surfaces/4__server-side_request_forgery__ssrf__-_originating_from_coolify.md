# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Coolify

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities within the Coolify application.  The primary goal is to identify specific code locations, functionalities, and configurations that could be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.  This analysis will inform the development team about necessary remediation steps and preventative measures to enhance Coolify's security posture against SSRF.  We will move beyond the general description and delve into concrete examples and potential attack vectors.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on SSRF vulnerabilities *originating from within Coolify's own codebase*.  This means we are concerned with how Coolify processes user-supplied data (especially URLs, hostnames, and IP addresses) that could influence the application to make unintended network requests.  We will examine:

*   **Core Coolify Features:**  Any feature that involves fetching data from external sources, configuring webhooks, integrating with third-party services, or handling user-provided URLs.
*   **API Endpoints:**  All API endpoints that accept URLs or network addresses as input.
*   **Configuration Options:**  Settings that allow users to specify remote servers, proxies, or other network-related parameters.
*   **Dependencies:**  Third-party libraries used by Coolify that might be susceptible to SSRF (though the primary focus is on Coolify's direct handling of requests).
* **Underlying infrastructure:** How Coolify interacts with cloud provider metadata services or internal networks.

We will *not* be analyzing SSRF vulnerabilities in applications *deployed* by Coolify, only in Coolify itself.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of Coolify's source code (available on GitHub) to identify potentially vulnerable code patterns.  We will search for:
    *   Functions that make network requests (e.g., using libraries like `fetch`, `axios`, `http.request` in Node.js, or equivalents in other languages).
    *   Areas where user input is directly used to construct URLs or network requests without proper validation or sanitization.
    *   Lack of whitelisting or blacklisting mechanisms for controlling outbound requests.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Using automated tools to send crafted inputs to Coolify's API endpoints and features, observing the application's behavior for signs of SSRF.  This will involve:
    *   Providing invalid URLs, internal IP addresses (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` to `172.31.x.x`), and cloud metadata service endpoints (e.g., `169.254.169.254`).
    *   Using URL schemes that might be mishandled (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`, `dict://`).
    *   Attempting to bypass any existing validation checks through techniques like URL encoding, double encoding, and case manipulation.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Reviewing the security advisories and known vulnerabilities of Coolify's dependencies to identify any potential SSRF risks introduced by third-party libraries.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Constructing attack scenarios based on identified vulnerabilities and assessing their potential impact.
* **Documentation Review:** Examining Coolify's documentation for any features or configurations that might inadvertently expose SSRF vulnerabilities.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

Based on the provided information and the methodology outlined above, we can perform a more detailed analysis:

**4.1. Potential Vulnerable Areas (Hypothetical, based on common Coolify use cases):**

*   **Webhook Configuration:**  If Coolify allows users to specify webhook URLs for events (e.g., deployment success/failure), this is a prime target.  The code that handles sending these webhook requests needs careful scrutiny.
    *   **Code Review Focus:** Look for code that takes the user-provided URL and directly uses it in an HTTP client without validation.  Check for functions like `sendWebhook(userProvidedUrl)`.
    *   **Fuzzing Focus:**  Try sending requests to internal IPs, cloud metadata endpoints, and using different URL schemes.
*   **Source Code Repository Integration:**  If Coolify fetches code from user-specified repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), the URL handling for these repositories is critical.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how Coolify constructs the URLs for cloning or fetching updates from repositories.  Look for any string concatenation that includes user input without sanitization.
    *   **Fuzzing Focus:**  Attempt to inject malicious URLs that might redirect the request to an internal server.
*   **Proxy Configuration:**  If Coolify allows users to configure proxy servers, the proxy address itself could be a target.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Check how the proxy address is validated and used.  Ensure that it's not possible to specify an internal address or a malicious server.
    *   **Fuzzing Focus:**  Try setting the proxy to internal IPs or known malicious proxy servers.
*   **Third-Party Service Integrations:**  Any integration with external services (e.g., monitoring, logging, notification services) that involves user-configurable URLs is a potential risk.
    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine the code that handles these integrations, paying close attention to how URLs are constructed and validated.
    *   **Fuzzing Focus:**  Attempt to redirect requests to internal or malicious endpoints.
* **Database/Resource URL Connections:** If Coolify allows users to specify connection strings or URLs for databases or other resources, these could be manipulated.
    * **Code Review Focus:** Examine how these connection strings are parsed and used. Look for vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to specify a different host or port.
    * **Fuzzing Focus:** Attempt to modify the connection string to point to an internal or attacker-controlled server.
* **API Endpoints:** Any API endpoint that accepts a URL as a parameter.
    * **Code Review Focus:** Examine the validation and sanitization logic for these endpoints.
    * **Fuzzing Focus:** Send a variety of malicious URLs to these endpoints, including internal IPs, cloud metadata endpoints, and URLs with unusual schemes.

**4.2. Specific Code Examples (Illustrative - These are NOT real Coolify code snippets):**

**Vulnerable Example 1 (Node.js):**

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function sendWebhook(url, data) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
    // ... handle response ...
  } catch (error) {
    // ... handle error ...
  }
}

// ... later in the code ...
// Assuming 'userSuppliedWebhookUrl' comes directly from user input:
sendWebhook(userSuppliedWebhookUrl, { message: 'Deployment successful' });
```

**Vulnerable Example 2 (Node.js):**

```javascript
const http = require('http');

function fetchFromUrl(userUrl) {
    http.get(userUrl, (res) => {
        // ... process the response ...
    });
}
```

**Mitigated Example (Node.js):**

```javascript
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const { URL } = require('url');

const ALLOWED_WEBHOOK_DOMAINS = ['example.com', 'api.anotherdomain.net'];

async function sendWebhook(url, data) {
  try {
    const parsedUrl = new URL(url);

    // Whitelist check:
    if (!ALLOWED_WEBHOOK_DOMAINS.includes(parsedUrl.hostname)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid webhook URL');
    }

    // Additional checks (e.g., prevent local IPs):
    if (parsedUrl.hostname.match(/^(127\.|192\.168\.|10\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])\.)/)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid webhook URL - Local IPs not allowed');
    }
    // Check for cloud metadata
    if (parsedUrl.hostname === '169.254.169.254') {
        throw new Error('Invalid webhook URL - Cloud metadata not allowed');
    }

    const response = await fetch(parsedUrl.toString(), { // Use the parsed and validated URL
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
    // ... handle response ...
  } catch (error) {
    // ... handle error ...
  }
}
```

**4.3. Impact Analysis:**

A successful SSRF attack against Coolify could have severe consequences:

*   **Internal Network Scanning:**  An attacker could probe Coolify's internal network, identifying running services and potentially vulnerable systems.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Access to internal databases, file systems, or other resources could lead to data theft.
*   **Cloud Metadata Access:**  On cloud platforms, attackers could access metadata services (e.g., AWS Instance Metadata Service) to obtain credentials, instance information, and other sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers could use Coolify to launch attacks against internal or external systems, causing denial of service.
*   **Further Exploitation:**  SSRF could be used as a stepping stone to exploit other vulnerabilities in internal systems.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

*   **Strict Input Validation:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach (Preferred):**  Maintain a list of allowed domains or IP addresses for outbound requests.  Only permit requests to these explicitly allowed destinations.
    *   **Blacklist Approach (Less Effective):**  Maintain a list of forbidden destinations (e.g., internal IP ranges, cloud metadata endpoints).  This is less effective because attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists.
    *   **URL Parsing:**  Use a robust URL parsing library to decompose URLs into their components (scheme, hostname, port, path, etc.).  Validate each component individually.
    *   **Regular Expressions (Use with Caution):**  Regular expressions can be used for validation, but they must be carefully crafted to avoid bypasses.  Avoid overly complex or permissive regexes.
*   **Network Segmentation:**
    *   **Dedicated Network for Outbound Requests:**  Use a separate network or network namespace for outbound requests initiated by Coolify.  This network should have limited access to internal resources.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Configure firewall rules to restrict outbound traffic from Coolify to only necessary destinations.
*   **Disable Unnecessary URL Schemes:**  If Coolify doesn't need to support schemes like `file://`, `gopher://`, or `dict://`, disable them explicitly.
*   **Limit Request Capabilities:**
    *   **Timeout:**  Set reasonable timeouts for outbound requests to prevent attackers from tying up resources.
    *   **Redirection Limits:**  Limit the number of allowed redirects to prevent attackers from using redirection chains to bypass validation.
    *   **Response Size Limits:**  Limit the size of responses to prevent attackers from exfiltrating large amounts of data.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Regularly update Coolify's dependencies to patch any known SSRF vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential SSRF vulnerabilities.
* **Least Privilege:** Run Coolify with the least amount of privileges necessary. This limits the potential damage from a successful SSRF attack.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Log all outbound requests made by Coolify, including the URL, source, and result. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.

## 5. Conclusion
