# Attack Surface Analysis for coollabsio/coolify

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Docker Images](./attack_surfaces/compromised_docker_images.md)

*   **Description:**  The application deployment process relies on pulling Docker images from registries. If a specified image is compromised (e.g., contains malware, backdoors), the deployed application will be vulnerable.
*   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify directly uses user-provided Docker image names or build configurations to pull and deploy container images. It trusts the specified source.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally or maliciously specifies a Docker image from an untrusted registry that contains a reverse shell. Coolify pulls and deploys this image, giving the attacker access to the container.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the deployed application and potentially the underlying Coolify instance or server, data breaches, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use trusted and verified Docker image sources.** Prefer official images or those from reputable organizations.
    *   **Implement image scanning tools** within your CI/CD pipeline or as part of Coolify's deployment process to identify known vulnerabilities in images.
    *   **Use private registries** with access controls to limit who can push images.
    *   **Regularly update base images** to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implement content trust (Docker Content Trust)** to verify the integrity and publisher of images.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Exposure](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Environment variables often contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and secrets. If Coolify's storage or handling of these variables is insecure, they could be exposed.
*   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify allows users to define and manage environment variables for their applications. Vulnerabilities in how Coolify stores, transmits, or displays these variables can lead to exposure.
*   **Example:** Coolify stores environment variables in plain text in its database or configuration files. An attacker gaining access to the Coolify server could read these files and obtain sensitive credentials.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, and potential financial loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and integrate them with Coolify if possible.** Avoid storing secrets directly within Coolify's configuration.
    *   **Encrypt environment variables at rest** within Coolify's storage.
    *   **Implement strict access control** to the Coolify instance and its underlying storage.
    *   **Avoid logging or displaying environment variables** in plain text in logs or the Coolify UI.
    *   **Regularly rotate sensitive credentials.**

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Build Processes](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_build_processes.md)

*   **Description:** If Coolify allows users to define custom build commands or scripts, and these are not properly sanitized, attackers could inject malicious commands that are executed on the Coolify server or within the build container.
*   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify might offer flexibility in defining build steps, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary commands based on user input or configuration.
*   **Example:** A developer provides a build command that includes user-controlled input without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate this input to execute commands like `rm -rf /` on the build server.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the Coolify server or build environment, potentially leading to data loss, service disruption, and the ability to inject malicious code into deployed applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid allowing arbitrary command execution in build processes.** If necessary, provide a limited set of pre-defined, safe build actions.
    *   **Sanitize and validate all user-provided input** used in build commands.
    *   **Run build processes in isolated containers** with limited privileges to minimize the impact of successful command injection.
    *   **Implement strict input validation** on any user-provided build configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Coolify API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/coolify_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If Coolify exposes an API for management or automation, vulnerabilities in this API can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify's API provides programmatic access to its features. Flaws in authentication, authorization, input validation, or other API security mechanisms can be exploited.
*   **Example:** The Coolify API lacks proper authentication, allowing anyone to create or delete applications. Or, an API endpoint is vulnerable to injection attacks, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Coolify instance and potentially all managed applications, data breaches, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms** for the Coolify API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   **Enforce the principle of least privilege** for API access.
    *   **Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input** to API endpoints to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Implement rate limiting and request throttling** to prevent abuse.
    *   **Regularly audit and penetration test the Coolify API.**
    *   **Secure API keys and credentials** used to access the API.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Access Controls on Coolify Itself](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_access_controls_on_coolify_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or improperly configured access controls to the Coolify management interface can allow unauthorized individuals to manage deployments and potentially compromise the entire platform.
*   **How Coolify Contributes:** Coolify provides a UI and potentially an API for managing its features. If these are not adequately secured, unauthorized access is possible.
*   **Example:** Default administrator credentials are used and not changed, allowing anyone to log in. Or, there's no multi-factor authentication enabled for Coolify user accounts.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Coolify platform, leading to the ability to deploy malicious applications, access sensitive data, and disrupt services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce strong password policies** for Coolify user accounts.
    *   **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all user logins to Coolify.
    *   **Follow the principle of least privilege** when assigning roles and permissions to Coolify users.
    *   **Regularly review and audit user access** to the Coolify platform.
    *   **Secure the network access** to the Coolify management interface (e.g., restrict access to specific IP addresses or networks).
