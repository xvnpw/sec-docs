Once in, they can control all applications and infrastructure managed by Coolify.

**Impact:** Complete control over all deployed applications, data breaches, infrastructure takeover, denial of service for all managed applications.

**Affected Component:** Core Coolify application, web interface, API, underlying operating system *hosting Coolify*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Coolify updated to the latest version.
*   Use strong, unique passwords for the Coolify admin user.
*   Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the Coolify admin user.
*   Restrict network access to the Coolify instance.
*   Regularly audit Coolify's security configurations.
*   Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems on the server hosting Coolify.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Coolify](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_coolify.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited access to Coolify could exploit flaws in *Coolify's* authorization mechanisms to gain higher privileges.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external services, compromise of deployed applications.

**Affected Component:** Secrets management module *within Coolify*, environment variable handling *within Coolify*, API endpoints *of Coolify*, web interface *of Coolify*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store sensitive information securely within Coolify (e.g., using encryption at rest).
*   Implement strict access controls within Coolify for accessing sensitive data.
*   Sanitize and validate user inputs in Coolify to prevent information leakage through error messages or logs.
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Coolify's code or configuration files.

## Threat: [Malicious Container Injection during Build/Deployment](./threats/malicious_container_injection_during_builddeployment.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has compromised the Coolify instance or the build process *managed by Coolify* could inject malicious containers or modify existing container images during the build or deployment stages *orchestrated by Coolify*. This could involve altering Dockerfiles *used by Coolify*, injecting malicious code *into the build process*, or using compromised base images *within Coolify's workflow*.

**Impact:** Introduction of backdoors, malware, or other malicious code into deployed applications, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further compromise.

**Affected Component:** Build process *within Coolify*, deployment engine *of Coolify*, Docker integration *within Coolify*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the Coolify instance to prevent unauthorized access.
*   Implement integrity checks for build artifacts and container images *used by Coolify*.
*   Use trusted base images and regularly scan them for vulnerabilities *within Coolify's configuration*.
*   Implement code review processes for changes to deployment configurations *managed by Coolify*.

## Threat: [Tampering with Deployment Configurations](./threats/tampering_with_deployment_configurations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could modify deployment configurations *managed by Coolify* to alter the behavior of applications or infrastructure. This could involve changing resource limits, network settings, or deployment scripts to cause denial-of-service, data breaches, or other malicious outcomes.

**Impact:** Application malfunction, resource exhaustion, data corruption, unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** Deployment configuration management *within Coolify*, web interface *of Coolify*, API *of Coolify*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement access controls within Coolify for modifying deployment configurations.
*   Track changes to deployment configurations within Coolify and audit them regularly.
*   Use version control for deployment configurations managed by Coolify.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Docker Socket](./threats/insecure_handling_of_docker_socket.md)

**Description:** If Coolify interacts with the Docker socket without proper security measures, an attacker who gains access to the Coolify instance could potentially use this access to gain root privileges on the host system.

**Impact:** Full control over the underlying host system, bypassing Coolify's security measures.

**Affected Component:** Docker integration module *within Coolify*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the privileges of the Coolify process interacting with the Docker socket.
*   Consider using alternative methods for container management that don't require direct access to the Docker socket.
*   Implement strong access controls for the Docker socket.

## Threat: [Lack of Secure Updates for Coolify Itself](./threats/lack_of_secure_updates_for_coolify_itself.md)

**Description:** If the update mechanism for Coolify is not secure, an attacker could potentially push malicious updates to the platform, compromising the entire instance.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Coolify instance and all managed applications.

**Affected Component:** Update mechanism *of Coolify*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure updates are delivered over HTTPS.
*   Implement signature verification for Coolify updates.

## Threat: [Abuse of Coolify's Remote Execution Capabilities](./threats/abuse_of_coolify's_remote_execution_capabilities.md)

**Description:** Coolify provides mechanisms for executing commands on managed servers or within containers. If not properly controlled *within Coolify*, these capabilities could be abused by attackers to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Server compromise, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Remote execution features *within Coolify*, API endpoints *of Coolify*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict authorization controls within Coolify for remote execution features.
*   Log and monitor all remote execution attempts initiated through Coolify.
*   Restrict the commands that can be executed remotely via Coolify.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Coolify Services](./threats/exposure_of_internal_coolify_services.md)

**Description:** If internal services within Coolify (e.g., API endpoints, databases *used by Coolify*) are not properly secured and are exposed without proper authentication, attackers could gain unauthorized access.
