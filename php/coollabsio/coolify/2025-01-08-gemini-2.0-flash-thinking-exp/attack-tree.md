# Attack Tree Analysis for coollabsio/coolify

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized control over an application managed by Coolify by exploiting vulnerabilities within Coolify itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Root Goal:** Compromise Application via Coolify

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Coolify Platform Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   OR
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   AND
                *   Bypass Authentication Mechanisms
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Weak Password Policies or Defaults
                *   Exploit Authorization Vulnerabilities
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Modify Critical Configurations
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Insecure Configuration **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   AND
                *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Default Credentials
                *   Weak Encryption of Sensitive Data
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Compromise Deployment Process **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   OR
                *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Inject Malicious Code During Build
                *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Inject Malicious Code During Deployment
```


## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Coolify Platform Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_coolify_platform_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This represents a broad category where attackers target vulnerabilities within the Coolify platform itself to gain control. Success here often grants wide-ranging access and the ability to manipulate managed applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to bypass authentication mechanisms or exploit flaws in authorization controls to gain unauthorized access to Coolify.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Weak Password Policies or Defaults:** Leveraging easily guessable or default credentials to gain initial access.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Modify Critical Configurations:**  Gaining sufficient privileges to alter key settings within Coolify, potentially impacting all managed applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known security flaws in the third-party libraries and components that Coolify relies upon. This is a common attack vector as vulnerabilities are frequently discovered in popular libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_insecure_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Taking advantage of misconfigurations within Coolify's setup.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Default Credentials:** Similar to the authentication flaw, this involves using default usernames and passwords for Coolify itself or its internal components.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Deployment Process [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_deployment_process__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the application deployment process managed by Coolify to inject malicious code or alter configurations.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Code During Build:**  Inserting malicious code into the application image during the build phase.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Code During Deployment:**  Injecting malicious code or altering configurations during the deployment phase, after the image has been built.
