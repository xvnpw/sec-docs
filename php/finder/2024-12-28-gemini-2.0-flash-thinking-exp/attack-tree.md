Title: High-Risk Attack Paths and Critical Nodes for Symfony Finder Usage

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Symfony Finder component.

Sub-Tree:

Compromise Application Using Symfony Finder [CRITICAL NODE]
└───[OR] Access Sensitive Files [CRITICAL NODE]
    ├───[AND] Manipulate Finder's Path/Name Search [HIGH-RISK PATH START]
    │   └─── Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]
    │       └─── Provide crafted path containing "../" sequences to access files outside intended directories. [HIGH-RISK PATH END]
    └───[AND] Exploit Finder's File Content Search [HIGH-RISK PATH START]
        └─── Retrieve Sensitive Data via Content Matching [HIGH-RISK PATH END]
            └─── Provide search terms that are likely to appear in sensitive files (e.g., "password", "API key").

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **Critical Node: Compromise Application Using Symfony Finder**
    * This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate success state. All efforts are directed towards achieving this.

* **Critical Node: Access Sensitive Files**
    * This represents a category of attacks that directly lead to the exposure of confidential information. Successful exploitation within this category can have severe consequences for the application and its users.

* **High-Risk Path: Manipulate Finder's Path/Name Search -> Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the ability to influence the file paths searched by Symfony Finder. By injecting sequences like `../`, they can navigate outside the intended directories and access sensitive files that should not be accessible.
    * **Likelihood:** High. Path traversal is a well-known and frequently encountered web application vulnerability. Developers sometimes fail to adequately sanitize or validate user-provided input used in file path construction.
    * **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of critical configuration files (containing database credentials, API keys), source code, or other sensitive data, potentially leading to full application compromise.
    * **Effort:** Low. Exploiting path traversal is often straightforward, requiring basic knowledge of file system navigation and web request manipulation. Readily available tools and techniques exist.
    * **Skill Level:** Novice.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. While basic attempts can be detected by monitoring for `../` sequences, more sophisticated encoding or bypass techniques can make detection more challenging.

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Finder's File Content Search -> Retrieve Sensitive Data via Content Matching**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers utilize the file content search functionality of Symfony Finder to search for keywords that are likely to appear in sensitive files. If the application allows users to specify search terms without proper restrictions, attackers can probe for sensitive information.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium. The likelihood depends on whether the application exposes content search functionality to user input and the presence of sensitive data within accessible files.
    * **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to the direct exposure of sensitive data like passwords, API keys, personal information, or proprietary data if these are present in the file content and discoverable through search.
    * **Effort:** Low. This attack is relatively easy to execute, requiring only the ability to input search terms.
    * **Skill Level:** Novice.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard. Distinguishing malicious searches for sensitive keywords from legitimate searches can be very difficult without deep content inspection and contextual understanding of user behavior.
