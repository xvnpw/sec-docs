* Threat: Path Traversal via User-Controlled Base Path
    * Description: An attacker can manipulate user-provided input that is directly used as the base directory for the Finder (e.g., through the `in()` method). By injecting path traversal sequences like `../`, they can instruct the Finder to search in directories outside the intended scope. This directly leverages the Finder's ability to traverse directories based on the provided path.
    * Impact: The attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration files, or even executable code that reside outside the intended application directory.
    * Affected Component: The `in()` method and the general path handling logic within the Finder.
    * Risk Severity: Critical
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Avoid using user input directly as the base directory for the Finder.**
        * **If user input is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences.**
        * **Use absolute paths for base directories whenever possible.**
        * **Consider using a predefined, limited set of allowed directories and validating user input against this set.**

* Threat: Path Traversal via User-Controlled File Patterns
    * Description: An attacker can manipulate user-provided input that is used as part of the file matching patterns (e.g., through the `name()` or `path()` methods). By injecting path traversal sequences within these patterns, they can instruct the Finder to locate files outside the intended directory structure. This exploits the Finder's pattern matching capabilities.
    * Impact: The attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive files that should not be accessible through the application's intended functionality.
    * Affected Component: The `name()`, `path()`, and potentially other methods that accept file patterns as input.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * **Avoid using user input directly in file matching patterns.**
        * **If user input is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences within the patterns.**
        * **Consider using more restrictive pattern matching techniques or explicitly defining allowed characters in patterns.**
