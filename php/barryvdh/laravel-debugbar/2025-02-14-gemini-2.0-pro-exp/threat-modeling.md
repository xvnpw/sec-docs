# Threat Model Analysis for barryvdh/laravel-debugbar

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Database Credentials

    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses the debugbar and navigates to the database section. They can view the complete database connection configuration, including hostname, username, password, and database name.  The attacker could then use these credentials to directly connect to the database, bypassing application-level security controls.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to the database.
        *   Data breaches (reading, modifying, or deleting data).
        *   Potential for complete database compromise.
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Legal and financial consequences.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Debugbar\DataCollector\QueryCollector` (and potentially `Debugbar\DataCollector\ConfigCollector` if database config is displayed there).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Disable debugbar in production (`APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env`).
        *   **Secondary:** Ensure the `config` collector is disabled or configured to exclude sensitive configuration data if debugbar *must* be used (highly discouraged). Configure `config/debugbar.php`: `'collectors' => ['config' => false]`.
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Use strong, unique database passwords and limit database user privileges.
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Implement database connection monitoring and alerting.

## Threat: [Exposure of Environment Variables (API Keys, Secrets)](./threats/exposure_of_environment_variables__api_keys__secrets_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Environment Variables (API Keys, Secrets)

    *   **Description:** An attacker views the debugbar's environment section (often within the "Config" collector), revealing the contents of the `.env` file. This exposes sensitive information like API keys, secret keys (e.g., `APP_KEY`), third-party service credentials, and other configuration data. The attacker can use these keys to access external services, impersonate the application, or decrypt sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of third-party services.
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   Potential for financial loss.
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Ability to forge requests or decrypt data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Debugbar\DataCollector\ConfigCollector` (specifically, environment variable display).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Disable debugbar in production (`APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env`).
        *   **Secondary:** Disable the `config` collector or exclude sensitive variables in `config/debugbar.php`.
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Regularly rotate API keys and secrets.

## Threat: [Exposure of Executed SQL Queries (Data Leakage & Schema Discovery)](./threats/exposure_of_executed_sql_queries__data_leakage_&_schema_discovery_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Executed SQL Queries (Data Leakage & Schema Discovery)

    *   **Description:**  An attacker views the debugbar's database section to see all SQL queries executed. This reveals database structure (tables, columns) and *can* expose sensitive data within query results or parameters.  This information facilitates targeted SQL injection or understanding the data model.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Leakage of sensitive data from query results.
        *   Database schema discovery.
        *   Increased effectiveness of SQL injection (if other vulnerabilities exist).
    *   **Affected Component:** `Debugbar\DataCollector\QueryCollector`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Disable debugbar in production (`APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env`).
        *   **Secondary:** Disable the `QueryCollector` (`'collectors' => ['db' => false]` in `config/debugbar.php`) if debugbar is absolutely necessary (strongly discouraged).
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements).
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Avoid selecting unnecessary data (`SELECT column1, column2` instead of `SELECT *`).

## Threat: [Exposure of Request Data (Session Data, Cookies, Headers)](./threats/exposure_of_request_data__session_data__cookies__headers_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Request Data (Session Data, Cookies, Headers)

    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses the debugbar's request details, viewing headers, cookies, session data, and POST data. This can expose authentication tokens (session IDs), CSRF tokens, or other sensitive user-submitted data, enabling session hijacking or request forgery.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Session hijacking.
        *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
        *   Exposure of user data.
        *   Impersonation of users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Debugbar\DataCollector\RequestCollector`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Disable debugbar in production (`APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env`).
        *   **Secondary:** Disable the `RequestCollector` (`'collectors' => ['request' => false]` in `config/debugbar.php`).
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Use secure, HTTP-only cookies.
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Implement robust CSRF protection.
        *   **Tertiary (Defense in Depth):** Avoid storing sensitive data in cookies/session.
