Here's the updated key attack surface list focusing on high and critical risks directly involving Dompdf:

*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTML/CSS
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML or CSS that causes the Dompdf server to make requests to internal or external resources.
    *   **How Dompdf Contributes:** Dompdf parses HTML and CSS, including tags like `<img>`, `<link>`, and CSS properties like `url()` and `@import`, which can point to external resources. If user-controlled input is used in the HTML/CSS, attackers can control these URLs.
    *   **Example:**  A user provides the following HTML: `<img src="http://internal.network/sensitive-data.txt">`. When Dompdf renders this, it will attempt to fetch the resource from the internal network.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of internal services, port scanning of internal networks, potential for further exploitation of internal systems, exfiltration of data from internal resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize HTML and CSS input by removing or escaping potentially dangerous tags and properties.
        *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for generated PDFs (though browser enforcement is limited).
        *   Configure Dompdf to disallow remote file access or restrict it to a whitelist of trusted domains.
        *   Run Dompdf in a sandboxed environment with limited network access.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries
    *   **Description:** Dompdf relies on external libraries for HTML parsing, CSS processing, and image handling. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be indirectly exploitable through Dompdf.
    *   **How Dompdf Contributes:** Dompdf integrates and uses these external libraries. If a vulnerability exists in a library used by Dompdf, processing malicious input through Dompdf can trigger that vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the Sabberworm CSS parser (used by older Dompdf versions). A specially crafted CSS file, when processed by Dompdf, could trigger this vulnerability, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even code execution (depending on the nature of the underlying vulnerability).
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability in the underlying library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the underlying vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Dompdf to the latest version to benefit from security patches in Dompdf and its dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Dompdf and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using dependency management tools to track and update library versions.
