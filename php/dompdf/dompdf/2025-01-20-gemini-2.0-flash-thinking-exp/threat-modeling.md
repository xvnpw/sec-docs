# Threat Model Analysis for dompdf/dompdf

## Threat: [HTML Injection / Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/html_injection__cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code, including JavaScript, into content processed by dompdf. This occurs when user-supplied or untrusted HTML is passed to dompdf without proper sanitization. When the generated PDF is opened in a vulnerable PDF viewer that supports JavaScript, the malicious script can execute, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or perform actions within the context of the PDF viewer.
*   **Impact:** If the PDF viewer supports JavaScript execution, the attacker could potentially steal cookies or other sensitive information, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform actions on behalf of the user within the context of the PDF viewer.
*   **Affected Component:** `src/Dompdf.php` (HTML parsing and rendering logic)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided HTML input before passing it to dompdf. Use a robust HTML sanitization library specifically designed to prevent XSS.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the application to restrict the capabilities of scripts executed within the PDF viewer (if applicable).
    *   Educate users about the risks of opening PDFs from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Indirectly via HTML)](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__indirectly_via_html_.md)

*   **Description:** If the HTML input processed by dompdf includes references to external entities (e.g., through SVG or other XML-based content), and if dompdf's internal processing or dependencies handle these entities insecurely, an attacker could exploit XXE vulnerabilities. This allows the attacker to force the server processing the PDF to access local files or internal network resources.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading local files), denial of service, or potentially remote code execution if the server's XML parser is vulnerable.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially dependencies used for HTML/XML parsing within `src/Dompdf.php` or related components involved in processing embedded XML-like content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable or restrict the processing of external entities in any underlying XML parser used by dompdf or its dependencies.
    *   Sanitize HTML input to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious entity declarations.
    *   Ensure that the server environment running dompdf has appropriate file system permissions to limit the impact of potential XXE attacks.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Options](./threats/insecure_configuration_options.md)

*   **Description:** dompdf offers various configuration options. If these options are not configured securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, if an option existed (though not currently a direct feature) to include remote files without proper validation, it could lead to security issues. More realistically, misconfiguring options related to font handling or resource access could create vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific misconfiguration. It could range from information disclosure to potentially more severe issues if insecure features are enabled.
*   **Affected Component:** `src/Dompdf.php` (configuration handling)
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific misconfiguration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully review and configure dompdf's options according to security best practices and the principle of least privilege.
    *   Avoid using default or overly permissive configurations.
    *   Regularly review the configuration to ensure it remains secure and aligns with the application's security requirements.
    *   Consult the official dompdf documentation for recommended security settings.
