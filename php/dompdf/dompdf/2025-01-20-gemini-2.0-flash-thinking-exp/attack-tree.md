## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Dompdf Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_dompdf_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the overall objective. Successful exploitation of any of the high-risk paths leads to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTML Parsing Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_html_parsing_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_start_.md)

* This category represents attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in how Dompdf parses and processes HTML input.

    * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Malicious HTML (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious HTML containing requests for external resources (e.g., using `<img>` or `<link>` tags with attacker-controlled URLs).
        * **Critical Node: Allowing Remote URL Loading:** This configuration setting is crucial for this attack. If Dompdf is configured to allow fetching resources from external URLs, it will follow the attacker's malicious requests.
        * **Impact:** High. Successful SSRF can allow the attacker to:
            * Scan internal networks to identify open ports and services.
            * Access internal services that are not exposed to the public internet.
            * Potentially execute arbitrary code on internal systems if vulnerable services are found.
            * Launch denial-of-service attacks against internal or external targets.
            * Read sensitive data from internal resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Font File Exploitation (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_font_file_exploitation__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker includes a specially crafted malicious font file within the HTML input.
        * **Critical Node: Dompdf's Font Parsing Library:** This attack relies on vulnerabilities within the third-party library that Dompdf uses to parse font files.
        * **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to:
            * Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application. This allows the attacker to gain complete control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration__high_risk_path_start_.md)

* This category highlights vulnerabilities arising from insecure configuration settings of Dompdf.

    * **Allowing Remote URL Loading (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** As described in the SSRF path above, enabling this setting makes the application vulnerable to SSRF attacks.
        * **Impact:** High (See SSRF impact details).

    * **Insecure File System Access (HIGH RISK PATH) (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** The Dompdf configuration allows access to sensitive file paths on the server. An attacker can craft HTML input to include these local files in the generated PDF output (e.g., by referencing them in `<img>` tags or stylesheets).
        * **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to:
            * Disclosure of sensitive information stored on the server's file system, such as configuration files, database credentials, or source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (HIGH RISK PATH) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Dompdf relies on various third-party libraries for functionalities like font rendering, image processing, etc. These dependencies might contain known vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities indirectly through Dompdf by providing input that triggers the vulnerable code in the dependency.
* **Critical Node:** This node represents the collective risk associated with all of Dompdf's dependencies.
* **Impact:** High. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency but can include:
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    * Denial of Service (DoS).
    * Information Disclosure.
