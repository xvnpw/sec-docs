# Attack Surface Analysis for dompdf/dompdf

## Attack Surface: [HTML and CSS Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/html_and_css_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

### Description:
Flaws in dompdf's core HTML and CSS parsing logic. These flaws can be exploited by providing malicious or malformed input that dompdf attempts to process.

### Dompdf Contribution:
Dompdf's fundamental function is parsing and rendering HTML and CSS. Vulnerabilities in this parsing engine are a direct consequence of using dompdf.

### Example:
A crafted HTML document with deeply nested elements or specific CSS rules that trigger a buffer overflow or infinite loop within dompdf's parsing engine, leading to a crash or resource exhaustion.

### Impact:
Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if memory corruption vulnerabilities are exploitable due to parsing flaws.

### Risk Severity:
Critical.

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided HTML and CSS input before passing it to dompdf. Utilize a robust and actively maintained HTML sanitization library to remove potentially dangerous tags, attributes, and CSS properties. Focus on removing elements and attributes known to be problematic or unnecessary for PDF generation.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Keep dompdf updated to the latest stable version. Security patches for parsing vulnerabilities are often released in newer versions. Monitor dompdf's release notes and security advisories.
*   **Resource Limits:** Implement strict resource limits (memory, CPU time, execution time) for the PHP processes running dompdf. This can help mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that exploit parsing vulnerabilities by limiting resource consumption.
*   **Security Testing and Fuzzing:** Conduct regular security testing, including fuzzing, specifically targeting dompdf's HTML and CSS parsing capabilities. This can help identify undiscovered parsing vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Remote Resource Handling](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_remote_resource_handling.md)

### Description:
Dompdf's feature to fetch remote resources (images, stylesheets, fonts) can be abused to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. An attacker can force the server running dompdf to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.

### Dompdf Contribution:
Dompdf directly provides the functionality to fetch remote resources through configuration options and HTML tags like `<img>` and `<link>`. Enabling this feature without proper controls directly introduces the SSRF attack surface.

### Example:
An attacker injects HTML content containing an `<img>` tag with a `src` attribute pointing to an internal server or service (`<img src="http://internal.server/admin/sensitive-data">`). If `DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE` is enabled, dompdf will attempt to fetch this resource from the internal server, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing access to internal services.

### Impact:
Information Disclosure (accessing internal resources, configuration files, metadata), Denial of Service (targeting internal services, overloading network infrastructure), potential for further exploitation of internal systems if SSRF allows interaction with vulnerable internal applications.

### Risk Severity:
High.

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Disable Remote Resource Fetching (Strongly Recommended):**  The most effective mitigation is to disable the `DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE` option in dompdf's configuration. If remote resources are not absolutely necessary for your PDF generation, disabling this feature eliminates the SSRF attack surface entirely.
*   **Strict Allowlisting (If Remote Resources are Required):** If remote resources are essential, implement a strict allowlist of permitted domains or URLs for remote resources.  Validate and sanitize URLs provided in HTML to ensure they conform to the allowlist before allowing dompdf to fetch them. Use a robust URL parsing and validation mechanism. Avoid relying solely on simple string matching.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  If possible, isolate the server running dompdf in a network segment that has restricted access to sensitive internal networks and services. This limits the potential impact of SSRF even if it is exploited.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for PDFs (Limited Applicability):** While CSP is primarily a browser security mechanism, explore if PDF-specific security headers or mechanisms can be used to restrict resource loading within the PDF context, although support for this may be limited across PDF viewers.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Dompdf](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_dompdf.md)

### Description:
Misconfiguration of dompdf settings can directly lead to security vulnerabilities. Certain configuration options, if not properly understood and secured, can significantly increase the attack surface.

### Dompdf Contribution:
Dompdf provides various configuration options that control its behavior.  Insecure defaults or misunderstanding the security implications of these options directly contribute to the attack surface.

### Example:
Enabling `DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE` without implementing proper URL validation or allowlisting, enabling debug settings in production environments which might expose sensitive information in error messages, or using insecure temporary directory configurations.

### Impact:
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Information Disclosure (via debug messages, temporary files), potentially other vulnerabilities depending on the specific misconfiguration.

### Risk Severity:
High.

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Secure Configuration Review:**  Thoroughly review all dompdf configuration options and understand their security implications. Consult dompdf's documentation and security best practices.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only enable necessary features and permissions for dompdf. Disable any configuration options that are not strictly required for your PDF generation needs.
*   **Disable `DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE` (If Possible):** As mentioned before, disabling remote resource fetching is a key security measure.
*   **Production-Ready Configuration:** Ensure that debug settings and verbose error reporting are disabled in production environments. Configure error logging to secure locations and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages displayed to users.
*   **Secure Temporary Directory:** Configure dompdf to use a secure temporary directory with appropriate permissions. Ensure that temporary files are properly cleaned up after PDF generation.
*   **Regular Security Audits of Configuration:** Periodically review dompdf's configuration settings as part of regular security audits to ensure they remain secure and aligned with best practices.
