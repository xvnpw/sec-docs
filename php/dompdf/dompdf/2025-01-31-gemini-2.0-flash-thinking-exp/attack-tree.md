## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Dompdf Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_dompdf_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has gained unauthorized control over the application, its data, or the server it runs on, by specifically exploiting vulnerabilities related to the Dompdf library.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Gain Code Execution on Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__gain_code_execution_on_server__critical_node_.md)

*   Achieving code execution is a critical step towards full compromise. It allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system takeover, or further attacks. Exploiting Dompdf vulnerabilities to gain code execution is a high-impact scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit HTML Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_html_parsing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTML Injection (Direct and Indirect):** If the application doesn't properly sanitize user input before using it to generate HTML that Dompdf processes, attackers can inject malicious HTML code. This can exploit vulnerabilities in Dompdf's HTML parser.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** HTML parsing is Dompdf's core function, making vulnerabilities here highly impactful. HTML injection is a common web vulnerability, and if user input flows into Dompdf without sanitization, it's a likely attack vector.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers inject HTML tags and attributes designed to trigger parser bugs in Dompdf. This could lead to code execution if Dompdf's parser mishandles specific HTML constructs.
    *   **Craft Malicious HTML/CSS Payloads:** Attackers can research known or potential parsing weaknesses in Dompdf and craft specific HTML/CSS payloads to exploit them.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Dompdf's HTML and CSS parsing is complex.  There's a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities or edge cases that can be exploited with carefully crafted payloads.
        *   **Exploitation:**  Attackers experiment with different HTML tag combinations, CSS properties, and document structures to find inputs that cause Dompdf to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit CSS Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_css_parsing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSS Injection (Direct and Indirect):** Similar to HTML injection, if user-controlled data influences CSS processed by Dompdf without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious CSS.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** CSS parsing, while often considered less dangerous than HTML, can still lead to vulnerabilities in complex parsers like Dompdf's. CSS injection is often overlooked in security considerations.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers inject malicious CSS properties or selectors designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Dompdf's CSS parser. This could lead to code execution if the parser mishandles specific CSS rules or constructs.
    *   **Craft Malicious CSS Payloads:** Attackers can craft specific CSS payloads targeting known or potential weaknesses in Dompdf's CSS parsing, including features like `@import` if enabled.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** CSS parsing is complex, and vulnerabilities can exist in how specific CSS features are implemented.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers experiment with different CSS properties, selectors, and features like `@import` to find inputs that trigger parser bugs in Dompdf, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Configuration or Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_configuration_or_dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Outdated Dompdf Version:** Using an old version of Dompdf that has known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Outdated software is a very common vulnerability. Exploits for known Dompdf vulnerabilities might be readily available, making exploitation easy.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers identify the Dompdf version used by the application (often through error messages or publicly accessible files). If it's outdated, they can use known exploits targeting those specific versions to gain code execution.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (FontLib, etc.):** Dompdf relies on external libraries. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, Dompdf-based applications become vulnerable.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Dependency vulnerabilities are also common and often overlooked. Exploits for dependency vulnerabilities can also be publicly available.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers identify Dompdf's dependencies and their versions. They then check for known vulnerabilities in these dependency versions. If vulnerabilities are found, they can be exploited to gain code execution, often through malicious font or image processing if the vulnerability is in a library like FontLib or an image processing library.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Achieve Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__achieve_denial_of_service__dos___critical_node_.md)

*   DoS attacks aim to make the application unavailable to legitimate users. Exploiting Dompdf for DoS can disrupt services and impact business operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Resource Exhaustion via Malicious HTML/CSS [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7__resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_htmlcss__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Memory Exhaustion:** Crafting HTML/CSS that requires excessive memory to parse or render by Dompdf.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Relatively easy to achieve with simple HTML/CSS constructs (e.g., deeply nested elements, very large tables). DoS attacks are often easier to execute than code execution exploits.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers send requests to generate PDFs with specially crafted HTML/CSS that forces Dompdf to allocate excessive memory, leading to memory exhaustion and application crashes or slowdowns.
    *   **CPU Exhaustion:** Crafting HTML/CSS that requires excessive CPU processing time to parse or render by Dompdf.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Also relatively easy to achieve, especially with complex CSS selectors or calculations within HTML/CSS.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers send requests to generate PDFs with HTML/CSS that causes Dompdf to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to application slowdowns or unavailability.
