# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dompdf/dompdf

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict HTML Input Sanitization for Dompdf](./mitigation_strategies/strict_html_input_sanitization_for_dompdf.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize HTML Sanitization Before Dompdf Processing:** Ensure that *all* HTML input intended for dompdf rendering is rigorously sanitized *before* being passed to the `Dompdf` class for PDF generation.
    2.  **Employ a Dompdf-Focused Sanitization Approach:**  Configure your HTML sanitization library (like HTMLPurifier or similar) with a whitelist that is specifically tailored to the HTML tags, attributes, and CSS properties that are actually *needed* for your desired PDF output using dompdf. Avoid allowing unnecessary or potentially risky HTML features.
    3.  **Focus on Dompdf's HTML Parsing Limitations:** Be aware of dompdf's HTML and CSS parsing capabilities and limitations. Sanitize against vulnerabilities that might arise from unexpected parsing behavior or edge cases within dompdf's rendering engine.
    4.  **Regularly Review Sanitization Rules in Context of Dompdf Updates:** As you update dompdf, review and adjust your HTML sanitization rules to ensure they remain effective against any new parsing behaviors or potential vulnerabilities introduced in newer dompdf versions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Dompdf - High Severity:** Prevents injection of malicious HTML that could be interpreted and potentially executed by dompdf's rendering engine, or by PDF viewers if the generated PDF contains embedded scripts.
    *   **HTML Injection Exploiting Dompdf Parsing - Medium Severity:**  Mitigates the risk of HTML injection attacks that could exploit specific parsing quirks or vulnerabilities within dompdf to manipulate the PDF content in unintended ways.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS Mitigation in Dompdf - High Impact:**  Directly addresses the primary risk of XSS arising from unsanitized HTML input processed by dompdf, significantly reducing the likelihood of script injection and related attacks within the PDF generation context.
    *   **Dompdf Parsing Exploitation Mitigation - Medium Impact:** Reduces the risk of attackers leveraging specific dompdf parsing behaviors for malicious HTML injection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Specify if HTML sanitization *specifically for dompdf input* is currently implemented. For example: "Yes, we sanitize HTML using HTMLPurifier before passing it to Dompdf, configured with a whitelist for PDF-relevant tags."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Specify if HTML sanitization for dompdf input is missing or needs improvement. For example: "Missing specific sanitization rules tailored for dompdf's rendering capabilities; currently using a general HTML sanitizer."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [CSS Input Validation and Sanitization for Dompdf](./mitigation_strategies/css_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_dompdf.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Validate CSS Specifically for Dompdf Compatibility:** If custom CSS is allowed, validate it against a whitelist of CSS properties and values that are known to be safely handled by dompdf and are necessary for your PDF styling requirements.
    2.  **Sanitize CSS to Prevent Dompdf Parsing Exploits:** Sanitize CSS input to remove or neutralize potentially dangerous CSS features that could exploit vulnerabilities in dompdf's CSS parser or lead to unexpected rendering behavior within dompdf.
    3.  **Focus on Dompdf's CSS Support Limitations:** Be aware of the CSS properties and features that are fully, partially, or not supported by dompdf.  Sanitize against CSS that might be misinterpreted or cause errors in dompdf's rendering process.
    4.  **Test CSS Sanitization with Dompdf Rendering:**  Thoroughly test your CSS sanitization rules by rendering PDFs with dompdf using various CSS inputs, including potentially malicious or complex CSS, to ensure the sanitization is effective and doesn't break intended styling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CSS Injection Exploiting Dompdf Parser - Medium to High Severity:** Prevents injection of malicious CSS that could exploit vulnerabilities in dompdf's CSS parsing engine, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or information disclosure during PDF generation.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex CSS in Dompdf - Low to Medium Severity:** Reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by excessively complex or maliciously crafted CSS that could overwhelm dompdf's rendering process.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dompdf CSS Parser Exploitation Mitigation - Medium Impact:**  Directly reduces the risk of attackers exploiting weaknesses in dompdf's CSS parsing through malicious CSS injection.
    *   **DoS Mitigation via CSS in Dompdf - Low Impact:**  Helps to mitigate DoS risks related to CSS complexity within dompdf, although resource limits are a more primary defense for DoS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Image URL Validation and Restriction for Dompdf](./mitigation_strategies/image_url_validation_and_restriction_for_dompdf.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Validate Image URLs Before Dompdf Fetches Them:** When dompdf processes HTML containing image URLs, validate these URLs *before* dompdf attempts to fetch and embed the images in the PDF.
    2.  **Implement Dompdf-Specific URL Whitelisting:**  Configure a whitelist of allowed domains or hosts from which dompdf is permitted to load images. This whitelist should be specifically enforced *before* dompdf initiates image requests.
    3.  **Prevent SSRF via Dompdf Image Loading:**  Ensure that URL validation and whitelisting prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks that could be initiated through dompdf's image loading functionality. Block access to internal network resources and untrusted external domains.
    4.  **Consider Local Image Handling for Dompdf:** For enhanced security, consider pre-fetching and storing images locally and then referencing these local paths in the HTML passed to dompdf, instead of allowing dompdf to directly fetch external URLs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Dompdf - High Severity:** Prevents SSRF attacks where an attacker could use dompdf's image loading functionality to make requests to internal resources or external services from the server running dompdf.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Dompdf SSRF - Medium Severity:**  Mitigates information disclosure risks associated with SSRF, where attackers could probe internal network configurations using dompdf as a proxy.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SSRF Mitigation in Dompdf - High Impact:**  Directly addresses the SSRF risk associated with dompdf's handling of image URLs, significantly reducing the potential for unauthorized requests and access to internal resources.
    *   **Information Disclosure Mitigation via Dompdf - Medium Impact:** Reduces the risk of information disclosure through SSRF vulnerabilities in dompdf's image loading.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Specify if image URL validation/restriction *specifically for dompdf* is implemented. For example: "Partially implemented, we validate URL format before dompdf processes it, but domain whitelisting is not specifically enforced for dompdf image loading."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Specify where image URL validation/restriction for dompdf is missing. For example: "Domain whitelisting for image URLs specifically for dompdf's image fetching is missing in all PDF generation features."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dompdf Resource Limits and Timeout Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/dompdf_resource_limits_and_timeout_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set Dompdf-Specific Execution Time Limit:** Configure a maximum execution time limit *specifically for the dompdf rendering process*. This prevents dompdf from running indefinitely and consuming excessive server resources if it encounters complex or malicious HTML/CSS.
    2.  **Set Dompdf-Specific Memory Limit:** Limit the amount of memory that the *dompdf process* can consume. This prevents memory exhaustion attacks where attackers provide input designed to crash the server due to excessive memory usage by dompdf. Configure this within dompdf's options or at the PHP/application level, targeting the dompdf execution.
    3.  **Implement Request Timeout for Dompdf Operations:** Set a timeout for the entire PDF generation request *involving dompdf*. If the dompdf rendering process takes longer than the timeout, terminate the request to prevent resource holding and ensure responsiveness.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Dompdf Resource Exhaustion - High Severity:** Prevents DoS attacks where attackers submit input that causes dompdf to consume excessive CPU, memory, or time, making the application unavailable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Mitigation for Dompdf - High Impact:**  Directly mitigates DoS attacks targeting dompdf's resource consumption, ensuring the application remains available even when processing potentially malicious or complex input for PDF generation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Specify if resource limits/timeouts are implemented *specifically for dompdf*. For example: "Yes, we have a global PHP execution time limit, which indirectly affects dompdf, but no specific memory limit or timeout configured directly for dompdf."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Specify where resource limits/timeouts for dompdf are missing or need improvement. For example: "Missing specific memory limit and request timeout configured directly for dompdf PDF generation operations."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dompdf Process Isolation (Sandboxing)](./mitigation_strategies/dompdf_process_isolation__sandboxing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Isolate the Dompdf Rendering Process:**  Run the dompdf process in an isolated environment to limit the potential impact of any vulnerabilities within dompdf. This can be achieved through containerization (like Docker) or virtual machines.
    2.  **Apply Resource Limits to Dompdf Container/VM:** When using containerization or VMs, apply resource limits (CPU, memory) specifically to the dompdf container or VM to further restrict its capabilities and prevent resource exhaustion attacks targeting dompdf.
    3.  **Implement Operating System-Level Sandboxing for Dompdf (if feasible):** Explore and implement operating system-level sandboxing mechanisms (e.g., seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux) to further restrict the capabilities of the dompdf process at the OS level, limiting its access to system resources and network.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Dompdf Process:** Ensure that the user account or process running dompdf has only the minimum necessary permissions required for its PDF generation tasks. Avoid running dompdf with elevated privileges.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **System Compromise from Dompdf Vulnerabilities - High Severity:** In the event of a critical vulnerability in dompdf that allows for code execution or system access, process isolation limits the scope of the compromise, preventing it from affecting the entire server or application.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Dompdf Process - High Severity:**  Isolation makes it significantly harder for an attacker who has compromised the dompdf process to move laterally to other parts of the application or the underlying infrastructure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dompdf System Compromise Mitigation - High Impact:**  Provides a strong layer of defense in depth specifically for dompdf, containing potential breaches and limiting the damage from dompdf-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dompdf Lateral Movement Mitigation - High Impact:**  Significantly reduces the risk of attackers using a compromised dompdf process as a stepping stone to further compromise the system.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Specify if process isolation *specifically for dompdf* is implemented. For example: "Yes, dompdf runs in a dedicated Docker container as part of our deployment architecture."]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Specify if process isolation for dompdf is missing or needs improvement. For example: "We use Docker for deployment, but haven't implemented OS-level sandboxing or fine-grained resource limits *specifically for the dompdf container*."]
