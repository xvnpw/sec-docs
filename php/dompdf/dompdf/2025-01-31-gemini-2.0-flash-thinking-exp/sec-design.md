# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: Generate PDF documents from HTML input.
 - Priority: Reliability and accuracy of PDF generation.
 - Priority: Performance and speed of PDF generation.
 - Priority: Compatibility with various HTML and CSS standards.
 - Priority: Ease of integration into existing PHP applications.

- Business Risks:

 - Business Risk: Performance bottlenecks in PDF generation impacting application responsiveness and user experience.
 - Business Risk: Vulnerabilities in dompdf leading to security breaches in applications using it, potentially exposing sensitive data within generated PDFs or the underlying system.
 - Business Risk: Lack of availability of PDF generation service impacting business operations that rely on document generation.
 - Business Risk: Legal and reputational damage due to insecure or improperly generated documents.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Input validation is expected to be performed by the application providing HTML to dompdf. (Implemented by application developers using dompdf)
 - security control: Dependency management using Composer to manage third-party libraries. (Described in composer.json and composer.lock)

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on application developers to properly sanitize HTML input before passing it to dompdf.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by dompdf.
 - accepted risk: Complexity of HTML and CSS parsing may lead to unforeseen vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) on dompdf codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Implement Dependency Scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by dompdf and ensure they are regularly updated.
 - security control: Encourage and provide guidelines for secure coding practices for developers using dompdf, focusing on input sanitization and output encoding.
 - security control: Implement regular security audits and penetration testing of applications using dompdf to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in integration and usage.
 - security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in applications using dompdf to mitigate risks from potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if PDFs are displayed in web browsers.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Authentication is not directly applicable to dompdf library itself, but applications using dompdf must implement authentication to control who can trigger PDF generation and access generated PDFs.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Authorization is not directly applicable to dompdf library itself, but applications using dompdf must implement authorization to control access to PDF generation functionality and generated PDFs based on user roles and permissions.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Dompdf must robustly handle and sanitize HTML input to prevent vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through HTML injection.
  - Requirement: Applications using dompdf must sanitize user-provided data before embedding it into HTML that is passed to dompdf to prevent injection attacks.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: If sensitive data is included in generated PDFs, applications should consider encrypting PDFs at rest and in transit. Dompdf itself does not provide PDF encryption features, this needs to be implemented by the application using dompdf or through post-processing of generated PDFs.
  - Requirement: Ensure secure communication channels (HTTPS) are used when applications using dompdf serve or transmit generated PDFs, especially if they contain sensitive information.
