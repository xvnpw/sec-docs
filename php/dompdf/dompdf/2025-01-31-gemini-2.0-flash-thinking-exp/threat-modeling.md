# Threat Model Analysis for dompdf/dompdf

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Resources](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_external_resources.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts HTML input that forces dompdf to load external resources (images, stylesheets, fonts) from attacker-controlled or internal network locations. This is possible if dompdf is configured to allow external resource loading and processes user-provided HTML. The attacker can probe internal network services, potentially access sensitive information, or cause denial of service by targeting internal resources.

**Impact:** Information disclosure about internal network infrastructure, potential access to internal services and data, denial of service against internal resources, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in targeted internal or external services.

**Affected Dompdf Component:** Resource Loader, Configuration

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable External Resource Loading:** Configure dompdf to completely disable loading external stylesheets, images, and fonts. This is the most secure option if external resources are not essential.
* **Strict Whitelisting of Allowed Domains/Protocols:** If external resources are necessary, implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains and protocols for resource loading in dompdf's configuration. Only allow loading from trusted and necessary sources.
* **URL Sanitization:** Sanitize URLs in HTML input to prevent manipulation and ensure they conform to the allowed whitelist.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the server running dompdf from sensitive internal networks if possible, limiting the potential impact of SSRF.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via File Paths in HTML](./threats/path_traversal_via_file_paths_in_html.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) into file paths within HTML input (e.g., in `<img>` `src` attributes, `@font-face` declarations, or custom attributes if processed). If dompdf processes these paths without proper validation, the attacker could potentially access files outside the intended directory on the server's file system.

**Impact:** Reading sensitive files from the server's file system, potential information disclosure.

**Affected Dompdf Component:** File Handling, Resource Loader, HTML Parser

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Processing User-Controlled File Paths:** Minimize or eliminate the processing of user-controlled file paths directly by dompdf.
* **Strict Path Validation and Sanitization:** If file paths are necessary, implement rigorous validation and sanitization to prevent path traversal. Reject paths containing `../` or other traversal sequences.
* **Use Absolute Paths or Path Mapping:** Use absolute file paths or map user-provided identifiers to safe, predefined file paths on the server. Avoid relative paths derived from user input.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the dompdf process with minimal file system permissions, limiting the impact of successful path traversal.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex HTML/CSS](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_htmlcss.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides highly complex HTML and CSS input to dompdf, designed to consume excessive CPU and memory resources during PDF generation. This can lead to slow PDF generation, server overload, denial of service for other users, or application crashes.

**Impact:** Denial of service, degraded application performance, server instability, application crashes.

**Affected Dompdf Component:** HTML Parser, CSS Parser, Renderer

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Timeout for PDF Generation:** Implement timeouts for PDF generation processes to prevent indefinite resource consumption. Terminate processes that exceed a reasonable time limit.
* **Limit HTML/CSS Complexity:** Impose limits on the complexity of allowed HTML and CSS input. This could include limits on the number of elements, nesting depth, CSS selector complexity, and image sizes.
* **Resource Monitoring and Rate Limiting:** Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) during PDF generation. Implement rate limiting for PDF generation requests to prevent abuse.
* **Queueing PDF Generation:** Queue PDF generation tasks to prevent overwhelming the server with simultaneous requests.

## Threat: [Code Execution Vulnerabilities in Dompdf or Dependencies](./threats/code_execution_vulnerabilities_in_dompdf_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in dompdf's code or its dependencies (e.g., font libraries, image libraries) could be exploited by an attacker. This could lead to remote code execution (RCE), local/remote file inclusion (LFI/RFI), or other forms of arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Affected Dompdf Component:** Core Dompdf Code, Dependencies (e.g., Font Libraries, Image Libraries)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Dompdf and Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update dompdf and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities. Monitor security advisories.
* **Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans of the application and its dependencies, including dompdf. Use automated vulnerability scanners and consider manual code reviews.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block common attack patterns targeting web applications and potentially dompdf vulnerabilities.
* **Sandboxing:** Run dompdf in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to minimize the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities. Use containerization or virtual machines to isolate the dompdf process.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the dompdf process with minimal necessary permissions.
