# Threat Model Analysis for dompdf/dompdf

## Threat: [Malicious HTML/CSS Injection leading to Server-Side Resource Exhaustion](./threats/malicious_htmlcss_injection_leading_to_server-side_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious HTML/CSS Injection leading to Server-Side Resource Exhaustion
    * **Description:** An attacker provides crafted HTML or CSS code as input to Dompdf. This code might contain deeply nested elements, excessively complex CSS selectors, or other resource-intensive constructs. Dompdf, during its rendering process, consumes excessive CPU and memory attempting to process this malicious input. This can lead to a slowdown or complete failure of the application's PDF generation functionality, potentially impacting other application features if resources are shared.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes unresponsive or unavailable. Performance degradation for other users. Potential server instability.
    * **Affected Dompdf Component:** Rendering Engine (specifically the HTML and CSS parsing and layout engine).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization of HTML and CSS before passing it to Dompdf. Use a dedicated HTML sanitization library with a strong allow-list approach.
        * Set resource limits for Dompdf processing (e.g., memory limits, execution time limits) if the library provides such options or through containerization.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Resource Inclusion (if enabled and not properly restricted)](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_external_resource_inclusion__if_enabled_and_not_properly_rest_1f8b7ff1.md)

* **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Resource Inclusion (if enabled and not properly restricted)
    * **Description:** If Dompdf is configured to allow fetching external resources (images, stylesheets, fonts) based on user-provided URLs without proper validation, an attacker can provide URLs pointing to internal network resources or external services. Dompdf, acting on behalf of the server, makes requests to these attacker-controlled URLs. This can be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or potentially interact with external APIs in an unauthorized manner.
    * **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - attackers can leverage the server's network access for malicious purposes. Potential access to sensitive internal resources or unintended interactions with external services.
    * **Affected Dompdf Component:** Resource Loading mechanisms (e.g., functions handling image fetching, stylesheet inclusion).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Disable external resource loading if not absolutely necessary.**
        * If external resource loading is required, implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains and protocols.
        * Sanitize and validate URLs provided for external resources.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Dompdf itself](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_dompdf_itself.md)

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Dompdf itself
    * **Description:**  Dompdf, like any software, may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft specific HTML/CSS input or exploit other weaknesses in Dompdf's code to trigger these vulnerabilities. This could potentially lead to remote code execution on the server, arbitrary file access, or other severe consequences.
    * **Impact:** Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. Arbitrary file access. Data breaches. Complete compromise of the application or server.
    * **Affected Dompdf Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., parsing logic, rendering engine, font handling).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Dompdf updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include fixes for known vulnerabilities.**
        * Regularly review security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Dompdf.
        * Implement strong input validation and sanitization as a defense-in-depth measure.
        * Consider using containerization and other security hardening techniques to limit the impact of potential exploits.
