## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Dompdf](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_dompdf.md)

**Critical Node: Compromise Application via Dompdf**

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dompdf Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dompdf_vulnerabilities.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Dompdf Vulnerabilities**

*   This represents a category of attacks that directly target weaknesses within the Dompdf library itself. Successful exploitation here bypasses the application's intended logic and security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/CSS leading to XSS in PDF](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmlcss_leading_to_xss_in_pdf.md)

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious HTML/CSS leading to XSS in PDF**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious HTML or CSS as input to the application, which is then processed by Dompdf to generate a PDF. If Dompdf doesn't properly sanitize this input, the malicious scripts can be embedded in the PDF. When a user opens this PDF in a vulnerable viewer, the scripts execute within the context of the viewer, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal information from the user's system.
    *   Execute arbitrary code on the user's system (depending on the PDF viewer's vulnerabilities).
    *   Impersonate the user or perform actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Malicious CSS](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_malicious_css.md)

**High-Risk Path: Achieve Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Malicious CSS**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious CSS that, when processed by Dompdf, instructs the server running the application to make requests to arbitrary URLs. This is possible if Dompdf allows fetching external resources defined in CSS (e.g., using `@import` or `url()`). This allows the attacker to:
    *   Scan internal network resources that are not publicly accessible.
    *   Interact with internal services or APIs.
    *   Potentially read sensitive data from internal services.
    *   In some cases, even execute commands on internal systems if the targeted service has vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Font File](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_remote_code_execution__rce__via_malicious_font_file.md)

**Critical Node and High-Risk Path: Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Font File**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a specially crafted malicious font file (e.g., TrueType, OpenType) to the application, which is then processed by Dompdf. Vulnerabilities in the libraries Dompdf uses to parse these font files can be exploited to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code on the server. Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the server running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Image File](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_remote_code_execution__rce__via_malicious_image_file.md)

**Critical Node and High-Risk Path: Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Image File**

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to font files, an attacker provides a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) to the application for processing by Dompdf. Vulnerabilities in the image processing libraries used by Dompdf (like GD or Imagick) can be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the server. This also grants the attacker complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary PHP Code](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_php_code.md)

**Critical Node and High-Risk Path: Execute Arbitrary PHP Code**

*   **Attack Vector:**  While highly unlikely with default configurations, if the application allows processing of HTML containing embedded PHP tags via Dompdf (due to specific configurations or older versions), an attacker can directly inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This is a direct and devastating vulnerability leading to complete server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Dompdf](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_dompdf.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Dependencies of Dompdf**

*   This highlights the risk of using third-party libraries. Dompdf relies on other libraries for various functionalities. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in bundled libraries (e.g., sabberworm/php-css-parser)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_bundled_libraries__e_g___sabberwormphp-css-parser_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in bundled libraries (e.g., sabberworm/php-css-parser)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Dompdf uses external libraries like `sabberworm/php-css-parser` to handle specific tasks. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities (e.g., in their parsing logic), an attacker can craft input that triggers these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to various outcomes, including:
    *   Denial of Service.
    *   Information Disclosure.
    *   In some cases, even Remote Code Execution depending on the specific vulnerability.
