### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving dompdf

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within HTML content that is processed by dompdf. This could be done by submitting crafted HTML through user input fields or other data sources that are subsequently used to generate PDFs. When a user opens the generated PDF in a vulnerable PDF viewer, the injected JavaScript could execute.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information displayed in the PDF, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform other actions within the context of the PDF viewer, depending on the viewer's capabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** HTML Parser, Renderer
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly sanitize all user-provided HTML content before passing it to dompdf using a robust HTML sanitization library.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) within the HTML passed to dompdf, although its effectiveness depends on the PDF viewer.
        *   Educate users about the risks of opening PDFs from untrusted sources.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Remote Resources
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft HTML content with references to external resources (images, stylesheets, etc.) using URLs pointing to internal or external systems. When dompdf processes this HTML, it will attempt to fetch these resources, potentially allowing the attacker to probe internal networks or interact with external services on behalf of the server.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could scan internal infrastructure, access internal services that are not publicly accessible, or potentially launch attacks against other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Remote URL Fetcher (within the HTML and CSS processing)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the loading of remote resources in dompdf's configuration.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols for external resources if remote loading is necessary.
        *   Sanitize URLs used for external resources to prevent manipulation.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries
    *   **Description:** dompdf relies on third-party libraries for HTML parsing, CSS processing, and PDF generation. If these underlying libraries have security vulnerabilities, they could be exploited through dompdf. An attacker might leverage a known vulnerability in a dependency to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the underlying library, but could range from code execution to information disclosure or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependencies (e.g., Sabberworm\CSS, PhenX\php-font-lib)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update dompdf and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for dompdf and its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Insufficient Input Sanitization Before Passing to dompdf
    *   **Description:** If the application does not properly sanitize user input before passing it to dompdf, even if dompdf has some built-in sanitization, vulnerabilities like XSS could still be exploited. An attacker could bypass dompdf's sanitization if the initial input is not properly handled.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows injection of malicious content into the generated PDF, potentially leading to XSS or other attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Application Code (interacting with dompdf)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side before passing data to dompdf.
        *   Use a dedicated HTML sanitization library before passing HTML to dompdf, even if dompdf performs some sanitization.
