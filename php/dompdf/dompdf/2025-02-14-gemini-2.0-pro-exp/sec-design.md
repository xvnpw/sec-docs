# BUSINESS POSTURE

Dompdf is a widely used, open-source PHP library for converting HTML to PDF. It's primarily used by web applications to generate PDF documents dynamically.

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a reliable and consistent HTML to PDF conversion service.
*   Maintain compatibility with a wide range of HTML and CSS standards.
*   Offer a user-friendly API for developers.
*   Ensure the library is performant enough for common use cases (e.g., generating invoices, reports, etc.).
*   Maintain an active and responsive open-source community.

Business Risks:

*   Inconsistent PDF rendering across different HTML/CSS inputs, leading to user dissatisfaction and potential business disruption if the PDFs are used for critical documents.
*   Performance bottlenecks, especially with complex HTML or large documents, impacting application responsiveness.
*   Security vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to compromise the server or leak sensitive data. This is a major risk, given that Dompdf processes potentially untrusted HTML input.
*   Lack of maintenance and updates, leading to incompatibility with newer PHP versions and web standards.
*   Reputational damage due to security breaches or unreliable performance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input sanitization: Dompdf attempts to sanitize input HTML to mitigate some risks, but this is not a comprehensive solution. (Described in the source code and documentation).
*   security control: Option to restrict access to local files: Dompdf provides options to control access to local files, limiting the impact of certain vulnerabilities. (Described in the documentation and configuration options).
*   security control: Option to restrict remote file access. (Described in the documentation and configuration options).
*   security control: Community vigilance: Being open-source, the project benefits from community scrutiny and contributions, which can help identify and fix security issues. (Visible in the GitHub repository's issue tracker and pull requests).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complex codebase: The codebase is complex and has evolved over time, making it challenging to audit and ensure complete security.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on external libraries: Dompdf relies on external libraries, which could introduce their own vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Potential for resource exhaustion: Processing very large or maliciously crafted HTML documents could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption.
*   accepted risk: Limited sandboxing: Dompdf does not operate in a fully sandboxed environment, meaning vulnerabilities could potentially affect the host system.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust content security policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development workflow.
*   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious input before it reaches Dompdf.
*   Explore options for sandboxing or containerizing Dompdf to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities in external libraries.
*   Perform penetration testing to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to Dompdf itself, as it's a library. Authentication should be handled by the application using Dompdf.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to Dompdf itself. Authorization should be handled by the application using Dompdf.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all HTML input, ideally using a whitelist approach.
    *   Enforce limits on input size and complexity to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Validate and sanitize any user-provided CSS.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If Dompdf is used to handle sensitive data, ensure that the data is encrypted in transit and at rest, using appropriate cryptographic protocols and algorithms. This is primarily the responsibility of the application using Dompdf.
*   Output Encoding:
    *   Ensure that any data rendered into the HTML is properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

## BUILD

The build process for Dompdf involves several steps, from development to the creation of a usable library. Since Dompdf is primarily a PHP library, the "build" process is less about compilation and more about packaging and dependency management.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] --> Git["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    Git --> CI["CI Server (GitHub Actions)"]
    CI --> Composer["Composer (Dependency Management)"]
    CI --> Tests["Automated Tests"]
    CI --> Linter["Code Linter (PHP_CodeSniffer)"]
    CI --> SAST["SAST (Psalm/PHPStan)"]
    CI --> Artifacts["Build Artifacts (Packaged Library)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: Developers write code and commit changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  Git Repository (GitHub): The central repository for the Dompdf source code.
3.  CI Server (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration. Workflows are triggered on events like pull requests and pushes.
4.  Composer (Dependency Management): Composer is used to manage Dompdf's dependencies. The CI server runs `composer install` to install the required libraries.
5.  Automated Tests: PHPUnit tests are executed to ensure the code functions correctly and to catch regressions.
6.  Code Linter (PHP_CodeSniffer): A code linter (like PHP_CodeSniffer) is used to enforce coding standards and identify potential style issues.
7.  SAST (Psalm/PHPStan): Static analysis tools like Psalm or PHPStan are used to detect potential bugs, type errors, and security vulnerabilities.
8.  Build Artifacts (Packaged Library): The final "build artifact" is the packaged Dompdf library, typically distributed via Packagist (Composer's repository). This isn't a compiled binary but rather a collection of PHP files and dependencies.

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   Dependency Management (Composer): Composer helps manage dependencies and ensures that known vulnerable versions are not used (with proper configuration and regular updates).
*   Automated Tests: Unit tests and integration tests help catch bugs early, including potential security-related issues.
*   Code Linter: Enforces coding standards, which can help prevent some common coding errors that could lead to vulnerabilities.
*   SAST: Static analysis tools can identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code before it is deployed.
*   GitHub Actions Security Features: GitHub Actions provides features like secret management and code scanning, which can be used to enhance the security of the build process.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   PDF Generation: The core process is the reliable and accurate generation of PDF documents from HTML input. This is critical for any business using Dompdf to create reports, invoices, or other documents.
*   Application Functionality: The web applications that integrate Dompdf rely on its functionality. Disruptions to Dompdf can impact the overall application.

Data Sensitivity:

*   User-Provided Data: The HTML input provided to Dompdf may contain sensitive data, depending on the application. This could include personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other confidential information. The sensitivity depends entirely on how Dompdf is being used.
