# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for laravel-backpack/crud

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Define CRUD Operations](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_define_crud_operations.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Required Operations:** For each entity managed by a CRUD controller (e.g., Product, User, Article), determine the *absolute minimum* set of CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete, list, show, reorder, revise) that users need to perform.
2.  **Explicitly Deny Access:** In each CRUD Controller (e.g., `ProductCrudController.php`), within the `setup()` method, use `$this->crud->denyAccess(['operation1', 'operation2', ...]);` to explicitly *disable* any operations that are *not* required.  For example: `$this->crud->denyAccess(['create', 'update', 'delete']);` to allow only listing and viewing of records.
3.  **Operation-Specific Setup:** If different operations require different configurations (e.g., different fields, different validation), use operation-specific setup methods like `setupListOperation()`, `setupCreateOperation()`, etc., and call `denyAccess()` within those if needed to further refine access control.
4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the enabled operations for each CRUD controller to ensure they still align with the application's requirements and user roles.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Creation (High Severity):** Prevents users from creating new records via the CRUD interface if they shouldn't.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Prevents users from updating existing records via the CRUD interface if they shouldn't.
*   **Unauthorized Data Deletion (High Severity):** Prevents users from deleting records via the CRUD interface if they shouldn't.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium to High Severity):** Limits access to specific CRUD operations, reducing the attack surface within the Backpack admin panel.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Creation:** Risk reduced to near zero for disabled operations within the CRUD interface.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Risk reduced to near zero for disabled operations within the CRUD interface.
*   **Unauthorized Data Deletion:** Risk reduced to near zero for disabled operations within the CRUD interface.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the available actions within the CRUD interface.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `ProductCrudController`: `denyAccess(['create', 'delete'])` implemented in `setup()`.
*   `UserCrudController`: `denyAccess(['create'])` implemented in `setup()`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `ArticleCrudController`: All operations are currently enabled.  Needs review and restriction based on user roles.
*   `CommentCrudController`:  Missing `denyAccess()` calls; all operations are enabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Backpack's Permission System (Pro/DevTools)](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_backpack's_permission_system__prodevtools_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Granular Permissions:** In `config/backpack/permissions.php` (or your chosen configuration file), define fine-grained permissions for each entity *and* each CRUD operation.  Example: `products.create`, `products.edit`, `products.list`, `products.delete`, `users.view`, `users.manage`.  Avoid broad permissions like "manage_products".
2.  **Assign Permissions to Roles:** Create roles (e.g., "Admin", "Editor", "Viewer") and assign the appropriate, specific permissions to each role.
3.  **Check Permissions in Controllers:** Within each CRUD Controller, use `$this->crud->user()->hasPermissionTo('permission_name')` *within the relevant methods* (e.g., `setup()`, `setupCreateOperation()`, and other operation-specific methods).  This checks if the logged-in user has the required permission *before* allowing access to the operation or displaying specific fields/columns within the CRUD interface.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** Use `if` statements based on the result of `hasPermissionTo()` to control the flow of execution and determine what the user can see and do within the CRUD interface.  This includes showing/hiding buttons, fields, and columns.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Provides fine-grained control over access to all CRUD operations and features within the Backpack admin panel.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents users from performing actions beyond their assigned permissions within the CRUD interface.
*   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Limits the potential damage from a compromised account by restricting access based on permissions, even within the admin panel.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced; access is strictly controlled by permissions within the CRUD context.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced; users can only perform actions allowed by their permissions within the CRUD interface.
*   **Data Breach:**  Reduces the scope of a potential breach by limiting data access within the admin panel.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic roles and permissions defined in `config/backpack/permissions.php`.
*   `UserCrudController`: Uses `hasPermissionTo()` checks for managing users.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `ProductCrudController`, `ArticleCrudController`, `CommentCrudController`:  No permission checks implemented; relying solely on `denyAccess()`.  Needs to be fully integrated with the permission system.
*   Permissions are not granular enough (e.g., only "manage_products", not "products.create", "products.edit", etc.).  Needs refinement to be operation-specific.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Field-Level Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/field-level_access_control.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Fields:** Within each entity managed by a CRUD controller, determine which fields contain sensitive data or should only be editable by specific users or roles.
2.  **Use 'access' Key:** In your field definitions within the CRUD Controller (e.g., in `setupCreateOperation()`, `setupUpdateOperation()`), add the `'access'` key to the field configuration array.
3.  **Define Access Logic:** The `'access'` key can be:
    *   `true`: Always allow access to the field.
    *   `false`: Always deny access to the field (it will not be displayed).
    *   A closure:  A function that returns `true` or `false` based on conditions.  The closure can access the current `$entry` (if editing) and the logged-in user (`$this->crud->user()`). This allows for dynamic access control.
4.  **Example:**
    ```php
    [
        'name' => 'secret_field',
        'label' => 'Secret Field',
        'type' => 'text',
        'access' => function ($entry, $user) {
            return $user->hasRole('admin'); // Only admins can see/edit this field
        }
    ],
    ```
5. **Alternative: removeField():** Alternatively, use `$this->crud->removeField('field_name');` or `$this->crud->removeFields(['field1', 'field2']);` conditionally within your operation setup methods (e.g., `setupCreateOperation()`, `setupUpdateOperation()`) to completely remove fields based on user roles or permissions. This is a more direct way to hide fields.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from editing specific fields within the CRUD interface.
*   **Data Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents sensitive fields from being displayed to unauthorized users within the CRUD forms.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Risk significantly reduced for protected fields within the CRUD interface.
*   **Data Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced for protected fields within the CRUD interface.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `UserCrudController`: `'access'` key used to restrict editing of the `password` field to only admins.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `ProductCrudController`: No field-level access control implemented.  Fields like `cost_price` should be restricted based on user roles.
*   `ArticleCrudController`:  No field-level access control.  Fields like `publication_date` might need restrictions for certain roles.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Column-Level Access Control (List View)](./mitigation_strategies/column-level_access_control__list_view_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Columns:** Within each entity's list view (the main table displaying records), determine which columns display sensitive data that should be hidden from certain users or roles.
2.  **Use 'access' Key (Similar to Fields):** In your column definitions within the `setupListOperation()` method of your CRUD Controller, add the `'access'` key to the column configuration array.  The logic is the same as for fields (boolean or closure).
3.  **Example:**
    ```php
    $this->crud->addColumn([
        'name' => 'cost_price',
        'label' => 'Cost Price',
        'access' => function ($entry, $user) {
            return $user->hasRole('admin'); // Only admins can see this column in the list view
        }
    ]);
    ```
4. **Alternative: removeColumn():** Alternatively, use `$this->crud->removeColumn('column_name');` or `$this->crud->removeColumns(['col1', 'col2']);` conditionally within `setupListOperation()` to completely remove columns from the list view based on user roles or permissions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents sensitive columns from being displayed in the CRUD list view to unauthorized users.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced for protected columns within the CRUD list view.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `UserCrudController`:  `removeColumn('password')` is used to prevent the password hash from being displayed in the list view.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `ProductCrudController`:  `cost_price` column is visible to all users who can access the list view.  Needs `'access'` control or removal based on user roles.
*   `ArticleCrudController`:  No column-level access control implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Filters with Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/custom_filters_with_access_control.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Custom Filter Logic:** If you have created custom filters for your CRUD interfaces, carefully examine the `apply()` method (or the equivalent method where the filter logic is implemented) of your custom filter class.
2.  **Check Permissions:** Within the `apply()` method, *before* applying the filter to the query, check if the logged-in user has the necessary permissions to access the data that would be returned by the filter.  Use `$this->crud->user()->hasPermissionTo()` with an appropriate permission name.
3.  **Conditional Filtering:**  Only apply the filter to the query *if* the user has the required permission.  If the user does not have permission, either:
    *   Return the query unmodified (effectively disabling the filter for that user).
    *   Throw an authorization exception (e.g., `abort(403)`).  This will prevent the user from seeing any results.
4.  **Don't Trust Input:**  Do *not* blindly trust the filter input values provided by the user.  Validate the filter input to prevent malicious manipulation or injection attacks.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents users from using custom filters to bypass access controls and view unauthorized data through the CRUD interface.
*   **Data Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Prevents malicious filter input from altering the query in unexpected ways, potentially leading to data leakage or other issues.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk significantly reduced if filters properly enforce permissions within the CRUD context.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Risk reduced by validating filter input within the CRUD context.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No custom filters are currently implemented in the project.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   If custom filters are added in the future, they *must* include permission checks and input validation within their `apply()` method.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Operation-Specific Validation](./mitigation_strategies/operation-specific_validation.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Operation-Specific Rules:** Determine if the validation rules for *creating* a resource are different from the rules for *updating* it.  For example, a `password` field might be required when creating a user but not when updating other user details.  Different operations often have different validation needs.
2.  **Use `setValidation()`:** Within your CRUD Controller, use `$this->crud->setValidation()` within the `setupCreateOperation()` and `setupUpdateOperation()` methods (and any other relevant operation setup methods, like `setupReorderOperation()`).
3.  **Define Operation-Specific Rules:** Pass an array of validation rules to `setValidation()`, or pass a Form Request class (recommended for more complex validation scenarios).  This *overrides* any model-level validation for that *specific* CRUD operation.
4.  **Example (array):**
    ```php
    // In setupCreateOperation()
    $this->crud->setValidation([
        'name' => 'required|min:3',
        'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email',
        'password' => 'required|min:8|confirmed',
    ]);

    // In setupUpdateOperation()
    $this->crud->setValidation([
        'name' => 'required|min:3',
        'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email,' . $this->crud->getCurrentEntryId(), // Unique, except for the current entry being updated
    ]);
    ```
5.  **Example (Form Request):**
    ```php
    // In setupCreateOperation()
    $this->crud->setValidation(CreateUserRequest::class);

    // In setupUpdateOperation()
    $this->crud->setValidation(UpdateUserRequest::class);
    ```
6. **Consistency:** Ensure that your validation rules are consistent with your field definitions (e.g., required fields, data types).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium to High Severity):** Ensures that data entered through the CRUD interface is valid for the specific operation being performed, preventing inconsistent or invalid data from being stored.
*   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** While general input validation is assumed, operation-specific validation within the CRUD context can provide an additional layer of defense against injection attacks by enforcing stricter rules for specific fields during specific operations.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Risk significantly reduced by enforcing appropriate validation rules within each CRUD operation.
*   **Injection Attacks:** Provides an additional layer of defense, but general input validation and output encoding are still crucial.  This focuses the validation within the CRUD workflow.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `UserCrudController`: Uses separate Form Requests for create and update operations.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `ProductCrudController`, `ArticleCrudController`, `CommentCrudController`:  Relying solely on model-level validation.  Needs operation-specific validation, especially for update operations, to be implemented within the CRUD controllers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Revisions Feature (Specific to CRUD)](./mitigation_strategies/revisions_feature__specific_to_crud_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Fields:** If using Backpack's revisions feature, determine which fields in your models contain sensitive data that should *not* be tracked in revisions (e.g., passwords, API keys, personally identifiable information).
2.  **Use `$dontKeepRevisionOf`:** In your Eloquent models that use the `RevisionableTrait` (provided by the `venturecraft/revisionable` package, which Backpack uses), add the `$dontKeepRevisionOf` property. This property is an array of field names that should be *excluded* from being tracked in revisions.
    ```php
    class User extends Model
    {
        use \Backpack\CRUD\app\Models\Traits\CrudTrait;
        use \Venturecraft\Revisionable\RevisionableTrait;

        protected $dontKeepRevisionOf = [
            'password',
            'remember_token',
            'api_key',
        ];
    }
    ```
3.  **Review Existing Revisions (if applicable):** If you are enabling revisions on an existing model, or if you have changed the `$dontKeepRevisionOf` array, you may need to manually review and delete old revisions that contain sensitive data. This is a one-time cleanup task.
4.  **Access Control for Revisions (within CRUD):** Ensure that only authorized users can view and revert to old revisions *through the Backpack interface*. Use Backpack's permission system (if you have Pro/DevTools) or integrate with Laravel Policies to control access to the revision history *within the CRUD context*.  This might involve checking permissions within a custom `revisions.blade.php` view or within the `revisions()` method of your CRUD controller.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Data Disclosure (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being exposed in old revisions accessible through the Backpack CRUD interface.
* **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the impact of a data breach by limiting the amount of sensitive data available in revisions accessible through the CRUD interface.
* **Compliance Violations (Varies):** Helps comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) by ensuring that sensitive data is not retained unnecessarily within the CRUD's revision history.

**Impact:**
* **Data Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced for fields listed in `$dontKeepRevisionOf` within the context of the CRUD interface.
* **Data Breach:** Reduces the scope of a potential breach by limiting the data stored in revisions accessible through CRUD.
* **Compliance Violations:** Improves compliance with data retention policies within the CRUD's revision system.

**Currently Implemented:**
* `$dontKeepRevisionOf` is used in the `User` model to exclude `password` and `remember_token`.

**Missing Implementation:**
* `$dontKeepRevisionOf` is *not* used in other models that have revisions enabled (e.g., `Product`, `Article`). This needs to be reviewed and implemented within each relevant model.
* Access control for viewing/reverting revisions is not explicitly enforced *within the CRUD interface*. This should be implemented using permissions (Backpack Pro/DevTools) or by customizing the revisions view/controller logic.
