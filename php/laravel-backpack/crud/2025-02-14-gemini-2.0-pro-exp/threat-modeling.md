# Threat Model Analysis for laravel-backpack/crud

## Threat: [Unauthorized Operation Access](./threats/unauthorized_operation_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, either unauthenticated or with insufficient privileges, gains access to a CRUD operation (List, Create, Update, Delete, Show, Reorder) that they should not be able to access. The attacker might try to directly access the URL of a restricted operation, manipulate request parameters, or exploit a misconfiguration in the access control logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Unauthorized viewing of sensitive data.
        *   Data modification: Unauthorized creation, updating, or deletion of data.
        *   System compromise: Potential escalation of privileges if the attacker can manipulate critical data or configurations.
    *   **CRUD Component Affected:**
        *   CRUD Controllers (specifically, the methods corresponding to each operation: `index`, `create`, `store`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`, `show`, `reorder`).
        *   Route definitions (if access control is not properly enforced at the controller level).
        *   Backpack's permission system (`hasAccess`, `hasAccessOrFail`, `hasAccessToOperation`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicitly disable unused operations:** In each CRUD controller, explicitly disable operations that are not required using `$this->crud->denyAccess(['operation_name']);`.
        *   **Enforce granular access control:** Use Backpack's permission system (`hasAccess`, `hasAccessOrFail`, `hasAccessToOperation`) within each operation method to verify the user's permissions.  Tie these checks to a robust role/permission system.
        *   **Validate route parameters:** Ensure that any parameters passed to CRUD operations (e.g., record IDs) are validated and that the user has permission to access the corresponding resource.
        *   **Regularly audit operation configurations:** Review the configuration of each CRUD controller to ensure that access controls are correctly implemented.
        *   **Test with different user roles:** Thoroughly test all operations with users having different roles and permissions to verify that access control is working as expected.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in List View](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_list_view.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the List operation can view sensitive data that should be hidden or restricted. This could occur if columns containing sensitive information (e.g., password hashes, API keys, personal details) are included in the list view without proper redaction or access control.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach: Exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized users.
        *   Privacy violation: Compromise of user privacy.
        *   Reputational damage: Loss of trust due to data exposure.
    *   **CRUD Component Affected:**
        *   CRUD Controller's `setupListOperation()` method (where columns are defined).
        *   `column` definitions within the CRUD configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Carefully select columns:** Only include columns in the list view that are necessary and do not contain sensitive data.
        *   **Use column types appropriately:** Utilize Backpack's column types (e.g., `closure`, `model_function`, `view`) to format or hide sensitive data.  For example, use a `closure` to display a masked version of a value.
        *   **Implement conditional column visibility:** Use Backpack's features to show or hide columns based on the user's permissions.
        *   **Avoid displaying sensitive data directly:** If sensitive data needs to be displayed, consider using a separate view or operation with stricter access controls.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload](./threats/malicious_file_upload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script, an executable, or a file containing malware) through a Backpack file upload field. This can occur if file type validation is insufficient or if uploaded files are stored in a publicly accessible location.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote code execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   System compromise: Full control over the server and application.
        *   Data breach: Access to all data on the server.
        *   Malware distribution: The server could be used to distribute malware to other users.
    *   **CRUD Component Affected:**
        *   CRUD Controller's `setupCreateOperation()` and `setupUpdateOperation()` methods (where file upload fields are defined).
        *   `upload`, `upload_multiple`, and `image` field types.
        *   File storage configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict file type validation:** Use Backpack's built-in validation rules (e.g., `mime`, `image`, `dimensions`) to restrict allowed file types to a specific whitelist.  Do *not* rely solely on file extensions.
        *   **Validate file content:** Use server-side validation to verify the file's content (e.g., using MIME type detection, image processing libraries) to ensure it matches the expected type.
        *   **Store files securely:** Store uploaded files in a non-publicly accessible directory, preferably outside the web root.
        *   **Rename uploaded files:** Use a random or unique filename to prevent directory traversal attacks and to avoid overwriting existing files.
        *   **Limit file size:** Implement file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
        *   **Consider using a dedicated file storage service:** Services like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage provide enhanced security and scalability for file storage.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Code (Operations, Fields, Filters, etc.) *within CRUD context*](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_code__operations__fields__filters__etc___within_crud_context.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in custom code *specifically within a CRUD operation, field, or filter*. This differs from the previous "custom code" entry by focusing *only* on vulnerabilities that directly impact the CRUD functionality.  This could be a custom operation that bypasses authorization, a custom field that allows XSS, or a custom filter with SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from unauthorized data access/modification within the CRUD context to potential escalation of privileges.
    *   **CRUD Component Affected:**
        *   Custom operations (defined in separate classes or within the CRUD controller).
        *   Custom fields (defined in separate classes).
        *   Custom filters (defined in separate classes).
        *   *Crucially*, these are vulnerabilities *within* the custom code that interacts directly with Backpack's CRUD mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability and its impact on CRUD)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Follow secure coding practices:** Adhere to secure coding principles when developing custom Backpack extensions *for CRUD*.
        *   **Sanitize and validate all input:** Treat all user input as untrusted and validate it thoroughly, *especially* within custom CRUD components.
        *   **Use parameterized queries or ORM methods:** Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries or Laravel's Eloquent ORM *within custom filters or operations that interact with the database*.
        *   **Encode output properly:** Prevent XSS by encoding output appropriately, *especially in custom fields or operations that render user-provided data*.
        *   **Implement CSRF protection:** Ensure that custom CRUD operations that modify data are protected against CSRF attacks.
        *   **Thorough security testing:** Perform rigorous security testing of all custom code *related to CRUD*, including penetration testing and code review.
        *   **Keep custom code minimal:** Minimize the amount of custom code to reduce the attack surface, *particularly within the CRUD context*.
        * **Respect Backpack's authorization:** Ensure custom operations and fields *do not bypass* Backpack's built-in authorization checks.
