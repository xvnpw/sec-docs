# Threat Model Analysis for laravel-backpack/crud

## Threat: [Default Admin Credentials Exploitation](./threats/default_admin_credentials_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Backpack admin panel using default or easily guessable credentials that were not changed after installation or during development.

**Impact:** Full administrative control over the application, including data manipulation, user management, and potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.

**Affected Component:** Backpack's Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Force strong password changes during the initial setup process.
- Disable or remove default user accounts immediately after setup.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the admin panel.
- Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Threat: [Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/insufficient_role-based_access_control__rbac__leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker or unauthorized user exploits misconfigured or overly permissive RBAC settings within Backpack to access, modify, or delete data they should not have access to. This could involve accessing CRUD operations for entities beyond their assigned roles.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, privilege escalation within the application.

**Affected Component:** Backpack's Permission Manager, CRUD Controllers, Routes

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Define granular roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
- Thoroughly test and review RBAC configurations after implementation.
- Regularly audit user roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate.
- Utilize Backpack's permission checks within custom code interacting with Backpack entities.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability via Backpack Forms](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability_via_backpack_forms.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates form data by including additional or unexpected fields in the request. If the corresponding Eloquent model is not properly protected (e.g., using `$fillable` or `$guarded`), these unintended fields can be updated in the database.

**Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation (e.g., setting `is_admin` to true), unauthorized modifications to sensitive attributes.

**Affected Component:** Backpack's Form Fields, CRUD Controllers, Eloquent Models

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Utilize the `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties in Eloquent models to explicitly define which attributes can or cannot be mass-assigned.
- Avoid using `$guarded = []` in production environments.
- Consider using Form Requests for more robust validation and data sanitization before database interaction.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling in Backpack Fields](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling_in_backpack_fields.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., malware, scripts) through Backpack's file upload fields due to insufficient validation on file types, sizes, or content.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, cross-site scripting (if uploaded files are served publicly), denial of service (by uploading excessively large files).

**Affected Component:** Backpack's Upload Field, Upload Multiple Field, File Field

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strict server-side validation on file types, sizes, and content.
- Use a dedicated file storage service with security features.
- Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
- Avoid serving user-uploaded files from the same domain as the application or implement proper content security policies.

## Threat: [Insecure Customizations and Overrides](./threats/insecure_customizations_and_overrides.md)

**Description:** Developers might introduce vulnerabilities when creating custom Backpack fields, operations, or views if they don't follow security best practices. This could include XSS vulnerabilities in custom view components or insecure handling of user input in custom controllers.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), injection attacks, or other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the custom code.

**Affected Component:** Custom Fields, Custom Operations, Custom Views

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Backpack components.
- Sanitize user input in custom controllers and views to prevent XSS.
- Regularly review and audit custom code for potential vulnerabilities.
- Be cautious when using third-party libraries or code snippets in customizations.

## Threat: [Exposed Backpack Configuration Details](./threats/exposed_backpack_configuration_details.md)

**Description:** Sensitive configuration details related to Backpack (e.g., API keys for integrations) might be inadvertently exposed in version control or deployment artifacts.

**Impact:** Full application compromise, access to connected services, data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Backpack's Configuration Files

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Utilize Laravel's environment variables (`.env`) to store sensitive configuration details.
- Ensure the `.env` file is not committed to version control.
- Use secure secrets management practices for sensitive credentials.
