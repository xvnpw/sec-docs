## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Input Validation Vulnerabilities leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_input_validation_vulnerabilities_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* Attack Vector: Inject XSS payload via text fields [CRITICAL]
    * Description: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into input fields that are later rendered in a web browser without proper sanitization.
    * Potential Impact: Account takeover of administrators or other users, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the admin interface.
* Attack Vector: Inject HTML/JavaScript via WYSIWYG editors [CRITICAL]
    * Description: Similar to the previous vector, but leverages the rich text editing capabilities of WYSIWYG editors to inject malicious scripts or iframes.
    * Potential Impact: Same as above, potentially with more sophisticated attack vectors due to the editor's features.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting File Upload Vulnerabilities leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploiting_file_upload_vulnerabilities_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

* Attack Vector: Upload Malicious Executable Files [CRITICAL]
    * Description: An attacker bypasses file type restrictions and uploads a malicious script (e.g., PHP shell) to the server. By accessing this uploaded file through a web request, they can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    * Potential Impact: Full compromise of the server, data breach, installation of malware, denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Access Control Weaknesses by Bypassing Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploiting_access_control_weaknesses_by_bypassing_authentication.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Default or Weak Admin Credentials [CRITICAL]
    * Description: The application uses default credentials provided by Backpack CRUD or developers have set easily guessable passwords for administrative accounts. Attackers can simply use these credentials to log in.
    * Potential Impact: Complete unauthorized access to the administrative interface, allowing full control over the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Exploiting Configuration Vulnerabilities to Access Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_exploiting_configuration_vulnerabilities_to_access_sensitive_information.md)

* Attack Vector: Access Sensitive Configuration Files [CRITICAL]
    * Description: Due to misconfiguration of the web server or application, attackers can directly access configuration files (e.g., `.env` in Laravel) that contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
    * Potential Impact: Full access to the database, allowing data exfiltration or manipulation. Access to external services via API keys. Potential for further lateral movement within the infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5: Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5_exploiting_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Backpack CRUD's Dependencies [CRITICAL]
    * Description: Backpack CRUD relies on other open-source packages. If these packages have known security vulnerabilities and are not updated, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. This often involves using publicly available exploits.
    * Potential Impact: The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but can range from denial of service to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Breakdown:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_breakdown.md)

* Inject XSS payload via text fields: Represents a common web vulnerability that can lead to significant impact through client-side attacks.
* Inject HTML/JavaScript via WYSIWYG editors: Similar to the above, highlighting the risk associated with rich text editing functionalities.
* Upload Malicious Executable Files: Represents a direct path to achieving remote code execution, the highest level of compromise.
* Exploit Default or Weak Admin Credentials:  A trivially exploitable weakness with severe consequences.
* Access Sensitive Configuration Files: Provides a direct route to critical credentials, bypassing authentication and authorization.
* Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Backpack CRUD's Dependencies: Highlights the importance of maintaining up-to-date software to mitigate known risks.
