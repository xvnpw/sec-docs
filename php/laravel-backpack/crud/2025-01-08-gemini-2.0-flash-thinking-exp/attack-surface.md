# Attack Surface Analysis for laravel-backpack/crud

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify unintended database columns by manipulating request parameters during create or update operations.
    *   **How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack's form submission directly maps input fields to Eloquent model attributes. If models are not properly protected with `$fillable` or `$guarded`, all submitted fields can be assigned.
    *   **Example:**  A user updating their profile could inject an `is_admin` parameter in the form data, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges if the `User` model doesn't have proper mass assignment protection.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side:**  Strictly define `$fillable` attributes in your Eloquent models to specify which attributes can be mass-assigned, or use `$guarded` to define attributes that should *not* be mass-assigned.
        *   **Server-Side:**  Carefully review the fields included in your Backpack CRUD configuration and ensure they align with the intended data modification.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default CRUD Routes](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_crud_routes.md)

*   **Description:**  Backpack automatically generates routes for CRUD operations (list, create, edit, delete). If these routes are not protected by authentication and authorization middleware, unauthorized users can access and manipulate data.
    *   **How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack simplifies route creation, but the responsibility of securing these routes falls on the developer.
    *   **Example:** An anonymous user accessing `/admin/users/create` and creating a new user account if no authentication middleware is applied.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, account creation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side:** Apply appropriate authentication middleware (e.g., `auth`) to the generated CRUD routes in your `routes/backpack/custom.php` file.
        *   **Server-Side:** Implement authorization middleware or gate checks to control which authenticated users can perform specific CRUD operations (e.g., only admins can delete users). Backpack's permission manager can be used for this.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Form Fields](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_form_fields.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into form fields, which are then executed in the browsers of other users viewing the data.
    *   **How CRUD Contributes:** If Backpack's form field types or custom widgets don't properly escape user input when rendering views, they can be vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Example:** A user entering `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a text field, and this script being executed when another admin views the entry.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side:** Ensure all data displayed in Backpack views is properly escaped using Blade's `{{ }}` syntax, which automatically escapes HTML entities.
        *   **Server-Side:** When creating custom widgets or columns, be extremely careful about outputting user-provided data and use appropriate escaping functions.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) that can be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack's `upload` and `image` field types facilitate file uploads. If not configured with proper validation, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploading a `shell.php` file containing malicious code through an image upload field that lacks proper file type validation.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server takeover, data breach.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side:** Implement strict file type validation on the server-side, allowing only expected file extensions.
        *   **Server-Side:** Validate file sizes to prevent excessively large uploads that could lead to denial of service.
        *   **Server-Side:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot to prevent direct execution.
        *   **Server-Side:** Use a dedicated storage service (e.g., AWS S3) with appropriate access controls.
        *   **Server-Side:** Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization for CRUD Operations](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_for_crud_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Users can perform CRUD operations they are not authorized to perform, leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
    *   **How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack provides tools for managing permissions, but developers need to implement and enforce these permissions correctly.
    *   **Example:** A regular user being able to delete other users' accounts if the delete operation is not properly protected by authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side:** Utilize Backpack's permission manager to define roles and permissions for different CRUD operations.
        *   **Server-Side:** Implement custom authorization logic using Laravel policies or gates to enforce fine-grained access control.
        *   **Server-Side:** Ensure that authorization checks are performed before any sensitive CRUD operation.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Custom Operations](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_custom_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Developers can add custom operations to Backpack CRUDs. If these operations are not implemented securely, they can introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack's extensibility allows for custom logic, but this also places the burden of security on the developer.
    *   **Example:** A custom "transfer funds" operation that doesn't properly validate input or authorize the user, allowing unauthorized fund transfers.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, financial loss, unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side:**  Treat custom operations with the same security scrutiny as core CRUD operations.
        *   **Server-Side:** Implement proper input validation, authorization checks, and output encoding within custom operation logic.
        *   **Server-Side:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom operations.
