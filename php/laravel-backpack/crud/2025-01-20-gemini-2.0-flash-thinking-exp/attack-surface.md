# Attack Surface Analysis for laravel-backpack/crud

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input in Custom Fields](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_in_custom_fields.md)

**Description:** Developers add custom fields to CRUD forms, and if user input to these fields isn't properly validated and sanitized, it can lead to various vulnerabilities.

**How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack simplifies the process of adding custom fields with different types, potentially leading developers to overlook proper validation for each type. The dynamic nature of field creation can make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities if developers aren't security-conscious.

**Example:** A developer adds a "Biography" text field without sanitizing HTML. An attacker enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in the field, which executes when other users view the record.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement. In cases involving database interaction, it could lead to SQL Injection if the input is used in raw queries.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement Server-Side Validation: Use Laravel's validation rules to enforce data types, lengths, and formats for all custom fields.
*   Sanitize User Input:  Use functions like `htmlspecialchars()` or a dedicated HTML purifier library to escape potentially malicious characters before displaying data.
*   Context-Aware Output Encoding:  Encode data appropriately based on the context where it's being displayed (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript).

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via CRUD Forms](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_crud_forms.md)

**Description:** Attackers can modify unintended model attributes by manipulating form data if the model isn't properly protected against mass assignment.

**How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack automatically handles form submission and model updates. If models used with Backpack CRUD don't have properly defined `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties, attackers can potentially modify sensitive attributes.

**Example:** A user can modify their `is_admin` flag by adding it as a hidden field in the form data if the `User` model doesn't explicitly guard this attribute.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification, or data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define `$fillable` or `$guarded`: Explicitly define which attributes are allowed for mass assignment in your Eloquent models. Use `$fillable` for whitelisting allowed attributes or `$guarded` for blacklisting protected attributes.
*   Review Model Definitions: Regularly review your model definitions to ensure they are properly protected against mass assignment.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

**Description:** Improperly configured or implemented file uploads can allow attackers to upload malicious files.

**How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack simplifies file uploads through its field types. If developers don't implement proper validation and storage mechanisms, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the server doesn't properly validate the file content and stores it in a publicly accessible directory, the attacker can execute the script.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), defacement, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate File Types:  Restrict allowed file extensions and MIME types.
*   Validate File Content:  Go beyond extension checks and verify the actual content of the file (e.g., using magic numbers).
*   Store Uploaded Files Outside Publicly Accessible Directories:  Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible via a web browser.
*   Generate Unique File Names:  Avoid predictable file names to prevent attackers from guessing file locations.
*   Implement Size Limits:  Restrict the maximum size of uploaded files to prevent denial of service.

## Attack Surface: [Bypassable Authorization Logic in Custom Operations](./attack_surfaces/bypassable_authorization_logic_in_custom_operations.md)

**Description:** Developers might implement custom logic for CRUD operations, and if authorization checks are not implemented correctly or are easily bypassed, unauthorized users can perform actions.

**How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack allows adding custom operations to CRUD panels. If the authorization logic within these custom operations is flawed, it introduces a vulnerability.

**Example:** A custom "Promote User to Admin" operation doesn't properly check if the current user has the necessary permissions, allowing any authenticated user to promote themselves or others.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification, or data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Backpack's Permission System: Leverage Backpack's built-in permission management features to control access to custom operations.
*   Implement Robust Authorization Checks:  Ensure that all custom operations have thorough authorization checks based on user roles and permissions.
*   Follow the Principle of Least Privilege: Grant only the necessary permissions to users.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Views](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_custom_views.md)

**Description:** If developers use user-provided data directly in custom Blade views without proper escaping, attackers can inject malicious scripts.

**How CRUD Contributes:** Backpack allows developers to create custom views for their CRUD panels. If these views don't properly handle user input, they can become vulnerable to XSS.

**Example:** A custom view displays a user's "About Me" field without escaping. An attacker enters `<script>stealCookies()</script>` in their "About Me" field, which executes when other users view their profile.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always Escape User Input in Blade Templates: Use Blade's escaping syntax (`{{ $variable }}`) to automatically escape output for HTML contexts.
*   Be Mindful of Raw Output:  Avoid using `!! $variable !!` unless absolutely necessary and you are certain the data is safe.
