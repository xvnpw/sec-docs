# Threat Model Analysis for laravel-backpack/crud

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests to CRUD forms, injecting data into unexpected database columns by exploiting misconfigured `$fillable` or `$guarded` model properties or lack of validation.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of sensitive data (e.g., changing user roles, prices, settings), potential privilege escalation.
*   **Affected CRUD Component:** CRUD Forms, Eloquent Models, Form Field Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly define `$fillable` and `$guarded` properties in Eloquent models to control mass assignment.
    *   Implement robust validation rules for all CRUD form fields using Backpack's validation features.
    *   Review and restrict editable fields in CRUD configurations to only necessary attributes.
    *   Consider using Form Requests for more complex validation logic.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Custom CRUD Operations](./threats/sql_injection_in_custom_crud_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious SQL code through user-controlled input fields that are used in custom CRUD operations, filters, or overridden queries due to insecurely constructed SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential database server compromise.
*   **Affected CRUD Component:** Custom CRUD Controllers, Custom Filters, Query Logic Overrides
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use Laravel's Query Builder or Eloquent ORM for database interactions in custom CRUD logic.
    *   Avoid raw SQL queries. If absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
    *   Sanitize and validate user inputs used in custom queries.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of custom SQL logic.

## Threat: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./threats/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker uploads malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) through CRUD file upload fields due to insufficient validation or insecure file handling. Path traversal attacks might be possible if file naming or storage is not properly implemented.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (if web shell is uploaded and executed), system compromise, data breach, denial of service (through large file uploads or resource exhaustion).
*   **Affected CRUD Component:** CRUD Form Fields (File and Image Uploads), File Handling Logic
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate file types, sizes, and extensions allowed for upload in CRUD field configurations.
    *   Store uploaded files outside of the webroot to prevent direct execution.
    *   Implement secure file naming conventions to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a dedicated file storage service with security features.
    *   Scan uploaded files for malware if feasible.

## Threat: [Insecure Backpack User Authentication/Authorization](./threats/insecure_backpack_user_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits weak passwords, default credentials, or bypasses misconfigured or weak authentication and authorization mechanisms in Backpack to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel and CRUD operations.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, privilege escalation, complete compromise of the application's administrative functions.
*   **Affected CRUD Component:** Backpack Authentication System, Permission System, User Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for admin users.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions within Backpack.
    *   Follow Laravel's security best practices for authentication and session management.
    *   Ensure Backpack's permission system is correctly configured and enforced for all CRUD operations.
