# Attack Surface Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Symfony Framework)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__symfony_framework_.md)

*   **Description:**  The community-skeleton is built upon the Symfony framework. Using an outdated skeleton version inherently means using an outdated Symfony version, which may contain known critical or high severity vulnerabilities.
*   **Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The skeleton dictates the base Symfony version and its initial dependencies.  Failing to update the skeleton means failing to update the core framework.
*   **Example:**  A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability is discovered in Symfony version X.  A project started with an older community-skeleton based on Symfony version X-1 remains vulnerable until the skeleton and its Symfony dependency are updated.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update the community-skeleton itself.** Updates often include Symfony version upgrades and security patches.
    *   Follow the uvdesk/community-skeleton release notes and security advisories for recommended update procedures.
    *   Utilize Symfony's security advisories to understand the security status of the underlying framework version used by the skeleton.

## Attack Surface: [Default Secret Keys and Salts](./attack_surfaces/default_secret_keys_and_salts.md)

*   **Description:** The community-skeleton might include default, placeholder, or weak secret keys and salts in its initial configuration files (like `.env` or `security.yaml`).  If developers fail to change these defaults, it creates a critical vulnerability.
*   **Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The skeleton provides these default configurations as part of its initial setup, potentially leading developers to overlook the necessity of changing them.
*   **Example:** The skeleton's `.env` file contains a default `APP_SECRET`. If this default secret is not changed in a deployed application, attackers can potentially decrypt sensitive data, forge user sessions, or bypass CSRF protection mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data decryption, session hijacking, CSRF bypass, account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately change all default secret keys, salts, and application secrets** provided in the skeleton's configuration files during the initial setup process.
    *   Generate strong, unique, and unpredictable secrets.
    *   The skeleton's documentation should explicitly warn against using default secrets and guide developers on secure secret management.

## Attack Surface: [Default User Roles and Permissions](./attack_surfaces/default_user_roles_and_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** The community-skeleton might pre-define overly permissive default user roles and permissions, or include default administrative accounts with weak or easily guessable credentials.
*   **Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The skeleton's initial security configuration (e.g., in `security.yaml` or database fixtures) sets the baseline for user roles and permissions.  If these defaults are insecure, applications built upon it inherit this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** The skeleton sets up a default "ROLE_ADMIN" with broad access and creates a default administrator account with credentials like "admin/password". If these defaults are not modified, attackers can easily gain administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functionalities, data manipulation, privilege escalation, full system control, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thoroughly review and restrict default user roles and permissions** defined by the skeleton to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Remove or disable any default administrative accounts** provided by the skeleton.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts created within the application.
    *   The skeleton's documentation should emphasize the importance of reviewing and customizing default roles and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production (Potentially by Default)](./attack_surfaces/debug_mode_enabled_in_production__potentially_by_default_.md)

*   **Description:** If the community-skeleton's default configuration or setup process inadvertently leads to debug mode being enabled in production environments, it exposes sensitive information.
*   **Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The skeleton's initial `.env` configuration or lack of clear guidance might result in developers deploying with debug mode unintentionally enabled.
*   **Example:** With debug mode active, detailed error messages, stack traces, and internal application paths are exposed. Attackers can leverage this information for reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, and crafting more effective attacks.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, enhanced reconnaissance for attackers, potential path traversal vulnerabilities revealed through error messages, exposure of application internals.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Ensure the community-skeleton's documentation clearly instructs developers to disable debug mode in production.**
    *   Verify that the skeleton's default `.env` configuration sets `APP_DEBUG=0` or `APP_ENV=prod` for production environments, or provides clear instructions on how to configure this correctly.
    *   Developers must explicitly verify and enforce debug mode being disabled in their production deployments, regardless of the skeleton's defaults.
