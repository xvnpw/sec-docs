# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Dependency Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/implement_dependency_scanning.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Scanning
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Tool:** Select a dependency scanning tool compatible with PHP and JavaScript projects (e.g., `symfony security:check`, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check).
    2.  **Integrate into CI/CD:** Configure your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run the dependency scanning tool on each build or commit. This ensures continuous monitoring of the UVDesk Community Skeleton's dependencies.
    3.  **Scan Composer and npm/yarn Files:**  The tool should scan `composer.lock` and `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock` files, which define the dependencies of the UVDesk Community Skeleton.
    4.  **Automate Reporting and Alerts:** Set up automated reports and alerts to notify developers of any identified vulnerabilities in the skeleton's dependencies.
    5.  **Remediate Vulnerabilities:** Establish a process to promptly review and remediate reported vulnerabilities by updating dependencies or applying patches relevant to the UVDesk Community Skeleton.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Exploits in third-party libraries used by the UVDesk Community Skeleton can lead to application compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** High risk reduction by proactively identifying and addressing known vulnerabilities in the skeleton's components.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** `symfony security:check` can be manually used with Symfony projects like UVDesk Community Skeleton. Automated CI/CD integration is likely **not** default.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated CI/CD Integration:** Needs to be specifically set up within the UVDesk project's CI/CD to automatically scan dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_dependencies.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Dependency Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Schedule:** Create a schedule for regularly checking and updating the dependencies of the UVDesk Community Skeleton (e.g., monthly).
    2.  **Check for Updates (Composer & npm/yarn):** Use `composer outdated` and `npm outdated`/`yarn outdated` within the UVDesk project directory to identify available updates for PHP and JavaScript dependencies.
    3.  **Review Changelogs:** Before updating, review changelogs and release notes of updated dependencies, especially for security-related fixes relevant to the UVDesk Community Skeleton's components.
    4.  **Apply Updates and Test:** Update dependencies using `composer update` and `npm update`/`yarn upgrade` within the UVDesk project. Thoroughly test the UVDesk application after updates to ensure compatibility and stability.
    5.  **Monitor Security Advisories (Symfony & Bundles):** Subscribe to security advisories specifically for Symfony and bundles used in the UVDesk Community Skeleton to stay informed about vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Outdated dependencies in the UVDesk Community Skeleton are a major source of vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** High risk reduction by ensuring the UVDesk Community Skeleton uses patched and up-to-date libraries.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Implemented as a Process:** UVDesk Community Skeleton doesn't enforce updates. It's the developer's responsibility to manage dependency updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Documented Update Process:**  Needs a clear, documented process for updating UVDesk Community Skeleton dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin Dependency Versions](./mitigation_strategies/pin_dependency_versions.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Pin Dependency Versions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Lock Files:** Ensure `composer.lock` and `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock` files (generated by Composer and npm/yarn respectively for the UVDesk Community Skeleton) are committed to version control.
    2.  **Install with Lock Files in Production:** In production deployments of the UVDesk Community Skeleton, use `composer install --no-dev` and `npm ci`/`yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install dependencies based on the lock files.
    3.  **Controlled Updates:** When updating dependencies for the UVDesk Community Skeleton, intentionally use `composer update` or `npm update`/`yarn upgrade` and regenerate lock files. Review changes before deploying.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Inconsistent Environments (Medium Severity):** Different environments using varying dependency versions of the UVDesk Community Skeleton can lead to issues.
    *   **Accidental Vulnerability Introduction (Medium Severity):** Automatic minor updates in UVDesk dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Inconsistent Environments:** High risk reduction by ensuring consistent dependency versions across UVDesk deployments.
    *   **Accidental Vulnerability Introduction:** Medium risk reduction by controlling updates and testing changes in the UVDesk application.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Lock files are inherently used by Composer and npm/yarn in UVDesk projects. Consistent usage in deployments might not be explicitly enforced.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Deployment Process Documentation:** Documentation should emphasize using lock files for UVDesk Community Skeleton deployments.
