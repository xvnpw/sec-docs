# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, based on the uvdesk/community-skeleton repository, aims to provide a foundation for building a customer support help desk system.

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a customizable and extensible platform for customer support.
  - Enable businesses to manage customer inquiries and support tickets efficiently.
  - Offer a community-driven open-source alternative to commercial help desk solutions.

- Business Goals:
  - Increase user adoption of the UVDesk platform.
  - Foster a community of developers and users around the platform.
  - Enable businesses to improve customer satisfaction through efficient support.

- Business Risks:
  - Data breaches exposing sensitive customer and business information.
  - System unavailability disrupting customer support operations.
  - Malicious attacks leading to data manipulation or system compromise.
  - Reputation damage due to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.
  - Compliance violations with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) if handling personal data.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository access control and vulnerability scanning. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community security reviews and contributions. (Implemented: Open Source Community)
  - security control: Project likely follows general web application security best practices, although specific controls need to be verified within the codebase. (Description: Codebase - needs verification)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching might lead to delays in addressing critical issues.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the project.
  - accepted risk: Security posture is dependent on the security practices of developers contributing to the open-source project.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Conduct regular manual security code reviews by security experts.
  - security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues by the community.
  - security control: Implement security awareness training for developers contributing to the project.
  - security control: Define and enforce secure coding guidelines for all contributors.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Secure user authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users (customers, agents, administrators).
    - Requirement: Support for strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
    - Requirement: Protection against common authentication attacks such as brute-force and credential stuffing.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and restrict access to sensitive features and data based on roles (e.g., administrator, agent, customer).
    - Requirement: Enforce least privilege principle, granting users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    - Requirement: Secure API authorization to protect backend services and data from unauthorized access.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)).
    - Requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to neutralize potentially malicious input.
    - Requirement: Use of parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to mitigate SQL injection risks.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data at rest, such as passwords and API keys, using strong encryption algorithms.
    - Requirement: Proper handling and management of cryptographic keys, including secure key generation, storage, and rotation.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Customer Support Ticket Management: The core function of the system. Disruption or compromise can directly impact customer satisfaction and business operations.
  - Customer Communication: Secure and reliable communication channels are essential for effective support.
  - User Authentication and Authorization: Secure access control is critical to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized actions.
  - Data Storage and Backup: Protecting customer and business data from loss or unauthorized access.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Customer Personal Data: Names, email addresses, contact information, support history. Sensitivity: High (PII, subject to privacy regulations).
  - Support Ticket Content: Customer inquiries, potentially containing sensitive information. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the nature of inquiries).
  - Agent Personal Data: Names, contact information, roles, permissions. Sensitivity: Medium (Employee data).
  - System Configuration Data: API keys, database credentials, application settings. Sensitivity: Critical (Secrets, compromise can lead to full system access).
  - Payment Information (if applicable): Credit card details, billing addresses. Sensitivity: Critical (PCI DSS scope if handled directly, ideally offloaded to payment gateway).
