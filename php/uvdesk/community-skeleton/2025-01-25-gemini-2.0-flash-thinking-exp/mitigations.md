# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Default Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/secure_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Upon initial installation of `uvdesk/community-skeleton`, immediately locate and modify the default credentials. This primarily involves the database credentials set in the `.env` file (specifically `DATABASE_URL`).
    2.  If the skeleton sets up a default administrator account during installation, change its password immediately after the first login through the administrative interface.
    3.  Ensure that all passwords used are strong and unique, avoiding common or easily guessable passwords.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Default Credential Exploitation (High Severity):** Attackers exploiting well-known default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the uvdesk application and its database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Default Credential Exploitation:** High risk reduction. Directly addresses the vulnerability of using default, publicly known credentials provided by the skeleton.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The skeleton *requires* database setup, but doesn't enforce strong password policies or guide users to change *all* default credentials beyond database.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce strong password policies during the initial setup process. Provide clearer, more prominent instructions in the installation documentation specifically highlighting the need to change *all* default credentials associated with the skeleton, including any default admin accounts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden Default Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_default_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  After installing `uvdesk/community-skeleton`, meticulously review all configuration files provided within the skeleton. Pay close attention to `.env`, `config/packages/*.yaml`, and any other configuration files that control application behavior.
    2.  Disable or remove any development-specific settings that are enabled by default in the skeleton but are not suitable for a production environment. This includes debugging tools, verbose logging, and development web profilers.
    3.  Ensure the application environment is explicitly set to `prod` in the `.env` file (`APP_ENV=prod`) as intended for production deployments of the skeleton.
    4.  Carefully review error reporting and logging configurations to prevent exposing sensitive information in production error messages. Configure logging to securely store logs and avoid verbose error displays to end-users.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Exposure of sensitive configuration details or internal application workings due to development-oriented default settings in the skeleton.
    *   **Unnecessary Feature Exposure (Low to Medium Severity):**  Development features left enabled in production within the skeleton potentially increasing the attack surface.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of information leakage through default configurations of the skeleton.
    *   **Unnecessary Feature Exposure:** Low to Medium risk reduction. Minimizes the attack surface by disabling development-specific features present in the default skeleton setup.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Symfony framework provides configuration mechanisms, but the *default* configuration provided by `uvdesk/community-skeleton` might still lean towards development convenience rather than production security.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The `uvdesk/community-skeleton` should strive for a more secure default production configuration out-of-the-box.  Installation documentation should explicitly guide users to review and harden the default configuration before production deployment, pointing out specific configuration areas within the skeleton to focus on.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Vulnerability Management](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_vulnerability_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Immediately after setting up the `uvdesk/community-skeleton`, update all PHP dependencies managed by Composer. Run `composer update` in the project root to fetch the latest versions of packages specified in `composer.json`.
    2.  Integrate a dependency vulnerability scanning tool into your development workflow specifically for the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` project. Tools like `composer audit` are directly applicable.
    3.  Establish a routine for regularly checking for dependency vulnerabilities within the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` project. This should be done frequently (e.g., weekly or monthly) using `composer audit` or a similar tool.
    4.  When vulnerabilities are reported for dependencies used by `uvdesk/community-skeleton`, prioritize updating the affected packages to patched versions as soon as possible, following security advisories.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities present in outdated dependencies included in the `uvdesk/community-skeleton`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Proactively patching dependencies of the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` significantly reduces the attack surface related to known vulnerabilities in its components.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Composer is used for dependency management in `uvdesk/community-skeleton`, making updates possible. However, *automated vulnerability scanning and proactive updates are not built into the skeleton itself*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The `uvdesk/community-skeleton` documentation should strongly recommend and guide developers on setting up automated dependency vulnerability scanning and update processes specifically for projects built using the skeleton.  Consider including basic `composer audit` checks in CI/CD pipeline examples within the skeleton's documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review for Customizations](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_for_customizations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Implement mandatory code review processes for *all* custom code and extensions developed on top of the `uvdesk/community-skeleton`. This is crucial as customizations are a primary source of newly introduced vulnerabilities.
    2.  During code reviews, specifically focus on identifying potential security vulnerabilities introduced by the customizations. Reviewers should be trained to look for common web application vulnerabilities (like XSS, SQL Injection, etc.) within the context of the helpdesk functionality being added or modified in the skeleton.
    3.  Ensure that code reviews are performed by developers with security awareness and knowledge of secure coding practices relevant to PHP and Symfony (the framework used by `uvdesk/community-skeleton`).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Custom Code (High Severity):**  Customizations to the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` can inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities if not developed with security in mind.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Custom Code:** High risk reduction. Code review acts as a critical gate to catch and prevent security flaws before they are deployed in customizations built on top of the skeleton.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented within the skeleton itself. Code review is a development process that needs to be adopted by teams *using* the `uvdesk/community-skeleton`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The `uvdesk/community-skeleton` project itself cannot enforce code review. However, its documentation should strongly emphasize the importance of code review for all customizations and provide guidelines or checklists for security-focused code reviews in the context of extending the skeleton.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_and_penetration_testing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the application built using the `uvdesk/community-skeleton`. These audits should go beyond general web application security and focus on helpdesk-specific features and functionalities provided by the skeleton and any customizations.
    2.  Penetration testing should simulate real-world attack scenarios against the deployed `uvdesk/community-skeleton` application to identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed during development and code review.
    3.  Security audits should include both automated vulnerability scanning and manual code review, focusing on the skeleton's core components and any extensions or customizations.
    4.  Remediate any vulnerabilities identified during audits and penetration testing promptly.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undiscovered Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):**  Security audits and penetration testing aim to uncover vulnerabilities that might exist in the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` application, its core, or customizations, which were not identified through other means. Severity depends on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undiscovered Vulnerabilities:** Variable risk reduction, but potentially high. Audits and penetration testing provide a crucial layer of security validation, especially for complex applications built on skeletons like `uvdesk/community-skeleton`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented within the skeleton itself. Security audits and penetration testing are activities that need to be performed by teams *deploying* applications based on `uvdesk/community-skeleton`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The `uvdesk/community-skeleton` project cannot directly implement audits or penetration testing for user applications. However, the project's documentation could recommend regular security assessments and potentially provide guidance or resources for performing security audits and penetration testing specifically for applications built with the skeleton.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Awareness Training for Development Team](./mitigation_strategies/security_awareness_training_for_development_team.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Ensure that developers working on projects based on `uvdesk/community-skeleton` receive security awareness training. This training should cover general secure coding practices and common web application vulnerabilities, but also specifically address security considerations relevant to helpdesk systems and the Symfony framework used by the skeleton.
    2.  Training should educate developers on the specific security features and potential pitfalls within the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` and its components.
    3.  Regularly update security training to keep developers informed about new threats and vulnerabilities relevant to the technology stack used in `uvdesk/community-skeleton` projects.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced Due to Lack of Security Knowledge (Variable Severity):**  Developers lacking security awareness may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities when working with the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` and its extensions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced Due to Lack of Security Knowledge:** Variable risk reduction, but potentially significant in the long term. Security training improves the overall security posture by reducing the likelihood of developers introducing vulnerabilities in the first place.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented within the skeleton itself. Security training is an organizational practice for teams *using* the `uvdesk/community-skeleton`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The `uvdesk/community-skeleton` project cannot directly provide security training. However, the project's documentation could include links to relevant security training resources for Symfony and web application security in general, specifically recommending training for developers working with the skeleton.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Incident Response Plan](./mitigation_strategies/incident_response_plan.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for applications built using `uvdesk/community-skeleton`. This plan should outline procedures for handling security incidents affecting the helpdesk system.
    2.  The incident response plan should include steps for:
        *   **Identification:** Detecting and recognizing security incidents.
        *   **Containment:** Limiting the damage and spread of an incident.
        *   **Eradication:** Removing the cause of the incident.
        *   **Recovery:** Restoring the system to normal operation.
        *   **Lessons Learned:** Analyzing the incident to prevent future occurrences.
    3.  Regularly test and update the incident response plan to ensure its effectiveness and relevance to the specific environment of the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Damage from Security Incidents (Variable Severity):**  Without a proper incident response plan, security incidents affecting the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` application can cause significant damage and disruption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Damage from Security Incidents:** Variable risk reduction, but potentially high in mitigating the *impact* of incidents. An incident response plan doesn't prevent incidents, but it significantly reduces the damage and recovery time when incidents occur.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented within the skeleton itself. Incident response planning is an operational practice for teams *deploying* applications based on `uvdesk/community-skeleton`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The `uvdesk/community-skeleton` project cannot directly implement an incident response plan for user applications. However, the project's documentation could recommend developing an incident response plan and provide general guidance or templates for creating such a plan specifically tailored to helpdesk applications and the technologies used in the skeleton.
