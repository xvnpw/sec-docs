# Attack Surface Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Attack Surface: [Ticket Manipulation/Escalation](./attack_surfaces/ticket_manipulationescalation.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized modification of ticket properties (priority, status, assignment, customer data) or escalation of privileges within the ticketing system.
**Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The `community-skeleton` provides the *core* logic, database schema, and controllers for managing tickets. This is the fundamental purpose of the framework.
**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `TicketController` (or a related service) to update a ticket's status or assignee without proper authorization.
**Impact:** Disruption of service, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential data breaches, reputational damage.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Server-Side):** Validate *all* input in controllers and services handling ticket updates, ensuring data integrity and type safety.
    *   **Robust Authorization Checks (Within Controllers/Services):** Implement granular, context-aware authorization checks *before* any database modification related to tickets. Verify user permissions against the specific ticket and action.
    *   **Auditing (Within the Framework):** Implement detailed logging of all ticket modifications within the `community-skeleton`'s code, capturing user, timestamp, and changes.
    *   **ORM Security (If Applicable):** Ensure secure use of any ORM (e.g., Doctrine) to prevent SQL injection that could bypass application-level checks.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Ticket Access (Data Leakage)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_ticket_access__data_leakage_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to view or modify tickets they are not authorized to see.
**Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The `community-skeleton` defines the access control logic and database queries for retrieving and displaying ticket data. This includes how user roles, groups, and permissions are applied to ticket access.
**Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in a `TicketRepository` method to retrieve tickets belonging to other users by manipulating query parameters.
**Impact:** Data breach, violation of privacy, loss of customer trust, legal and regulatory consequences.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Access Control Enforcement (Repository/Service Layer):** Implement robust access control checks within the `community-skeleton`'s data access layer (repositories, services) *before* returning any ticket data.
    *   **Data Minimization (Within the Framework):** Ensure that only the necessary ticket data is retrieved and returned based on the user's context and permissions.  Avoid exposing unnecessary data.
    *   **Secure Session Management (If Handled by the Skeleton):** If the `community-skeleton` manages sessions, ensure secure session handling to prevent hijacking.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads (via Attachments)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads__via_attachments_.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file through the ticket attachment feature.
**Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The `community-skeleton` provides the code for handling file uploads, including storage, retrieval, and potentially any processing (e.g., image resizing).
**Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP file disguised as an image, and a flaw in the `community-skeleton`'s file handling logic allows it to be executed.
**Impact:** Server compromise, malware distribution, data theft, denial of service, XSS attacks.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation (Content-Based):** Implement file type validation within the `community-skeleton`'s upload handling code, based on *content analysis* (e.g., magic numbers), not just file extensions.
    *   **File Size Limits (Within the Framework):** Enforce file size limits within the upload handling code.
    *   **Malware Scanning (Integration Point):** Provide a clear integration point within the `community-skeleton` for connecting to a malware scanning service.
    *   **Secure Storage (Framework Configuration):** The `community-skeleton` should be configured to store uploaded files *outside* the web root and use randomly generated filenames.
    *   **Sandboxing (If Feasible):** If the framework provides any functionality for viewing or processing attachments, consider sandboxing these operations.

## Attack Surface: [Email Spoofing/Injection (via Mailbox Integration)](./attack_surfaces/email_spoofinginjection__via_mailbox_integration_.md)

**Description:** An attacker forges emails to manipulate the ticketing system.
**Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The `community-skeleton` includes the code for connecting to mailboxes, parsing emails, and creating/updating tickets based on email content. This parsing and processing logic is the direct attack surface.
**Example:** An attacker sends an email with malicious headers that exploit a vulnerability in the `community-skeleton`'s email parsing library, leading to code execution or data manipulation.
**Impact:** Phishing, malware distribution, data theft, unauthorized ticket creation/modification.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Email Header Validation (Within the Framework):** Implement rigorous validation of all email headers within the `community-skeleton`'s email processing code.
    *   **Content Sanitization (Within the Framework):** Sanitize all email content (subject, body, attachments) within the framework's code to remove potentially malicious code.
    *   **Secure Mailbox Configuration (Framework Guidance):** Provide clear guidance and configuration options within the `community-skeleton` for securely connecting to mailboxes (e.g., using TLS/SSL, strong authentication).
    *   **Rate Limiting (Integration Point):** Provide a mechanism within the framework for implementing rate limiting on email processing.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation (Agent Roles)](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation__agent_roles_.md)

**Description:** An attacker with a low-privilege agent account gains higher privileges.
**Community-Skeleton Contribution:** The `community-skeleton` defines the agent roles, permissions, and the logic for enforcing these roles within the application.
**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `community-skeleton`'s user management code (e.g., a controller or service) to modify their own role or permissions.
**Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, unauthorized access.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust RBAC (Within the Framework):** Implement a well-defined and strictly enforced RBAC system *within the community-skeleton's code*. All actions should be protected by authorization checks.
    *   **Secure Session Management (If Handled by the Skeleton):** If session management is part of the `community-skeleton`, ensure secure session handling.
    *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):** Validate all input related to user management and role assignments within the framework's controllers and services.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Framework Design):** Design the `community-skeleton` to enforce the principle of least privilege by default.

## Attack Surface: [API Vulnerabilities (if applicable and part of the skeleton)](./attack_surfaces/api_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_and_part_of_the_skeleton_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in a `community-skeleton`-provided API allow attackers to compromise the system.
**Community-Skeleton Contribution:** If the `community-skeleton` *includes* an API, the framework's code for handling API requests, authentication, authorization, and data processing is the direct attack surface.
**Example:** An attacker exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in a `community-skeleton`-provided API endpoint to access the database.
**Impact:** Data breach, system compromise, unauthorized access.
**Risk Severity:** High (if a `community-skeleton` API exists)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication (Framework Implementation):** Implement robust authentication for all API endpoints *within the community-skeleton's code*.
    *   **Robust Authorization (Framework Implementation):** Enforce granular authorization checks for every API request *within the framework*.
    *   **Input Validation (Server-Side, Framework Level):** Validate all API input within the `community-skeleton`'s controllers and services.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Framework Integration):** Provide a mechanism within the `community-skeleton` for implementing API rate limiting.
    *   **API Documentation and Security Testing (Framework-Specific):** Maintain clear API documentation and conduct security testing specifically targeting the `community-skeleton`'s API.
