# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management (Skeleton-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management__skeleton-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous Dependency Auditing and Updates (Focus on Skeleton's Dependencies)

**Description:**
1.  **Automated Scanning:** Integrate a tool like Dependabot (GitHub) or Snyk, specifically configured to monitor the `community-skeleton`'s `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files. This is *crucial* because the skeleton defines the core set of dependencies.
2.  **Prioritize Skeleton Updates:** When the `community-skeleton` itself receives updates, prioritize reviewing and applying them. These updates often include dependency upgrades and security fixes for the core framework.
3.  **Composer Audit:** Regularly run `composer audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in the *locked* dependencies (those specified in `composer.lock`). This is more precise than just `composer outdated`.
4.  **Symfony Security Checker:** Integrate `symfony security:check` as a *mandatory* step in the CI/CD pipeline. This tool specifically checks Symfony and related dependencies for known vulnerabilities.  Make it a build-breaker.
5.  **Vendor Folder Scrutiny:** After major updates to the `community-skeleton` or its dependencies, perform a manual review of the `vendor` directory.  Look for unexpected packages or changes. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
6. **Dependency Pinning (Strategic):** If a critical vulnerability exists in a dependency *required by the skeleton*, and an immediate update is impossible due to compatibility issues, *temporarily* pin the dependency to a known-safe version in `composer.json`. Document this clearly and revisit it ASAP.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Vulnerabilities in core dependencies (Symfony, Doctrine, Twig, etc.) defined by the skeleton can lead to RCE.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities in JavaScript libraries included by the skeleton.
    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi) (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities in database-related packages defined by the skeleton.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Vulnerabilities in core components.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities in any dependency.

**Impact:**
    *   **RCE, XSS, SQLi, DoS, Data Breaches:** Risk significantly reduced (from High/Critical to Low/Medium, depending on the speed and thoroughness of updates).  Focusing on the skeleton's dependencies provides a strong foundation.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Adjust to your project)
    *   `composer.lock` is committed.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Adjust to your project)
    *   Automated scanning (Dependabot/Snyk) targeting the skeleton's dependencies.
    *   `symfony security:check` in CI/CD.
    *   Formal process for prioritizing skeleton updates.
    *   Vendor folder scrutiny after major updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration (Skeleton-Provided Defaults)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration__skeleton-provided_defaults_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Harden and Validate Skeleton-Provided Configuration

**Description:**
1.  **Review Default Configs:**  *Thoroughly* review all configuration files provided by the `community-skeleton` (e.g., `config/packages/*.yaml`, `.env.dist`).  Do *not* assume the defaults are secure.
2.  **Environment Variables:** Ensure *all* sensitive values (database credentials, API keys, `APP_SECRET`) are loaded from environment variables, *not* hardcoded in configuration files. The skeleton likely provides `.env.dist` as a template; use it correctly.
3.  **`APP_ENV` and `APP_DEBUG`:**  Verify that `APP_ENV` is set to `prod` and `APP_DEBUG` is `false` in the production environment. The skeleton should provide mechanisms for this, but double-check.
4.  **File Uploads (Skeleton Settings):**  Carefully review and configure any settings related to file uploads that are defined within the skeleton's configuration. This includes upload paths, allowed file types, and size limits. Store uploaded files outside the web root if the skeleton's structure allows.
5.  **Session Configuration (Skeleton Defaults):** Examine the session configuration provided by the skeleton (likely in `config/packages/framework.yaml`). Ensure secure settings are used (e.g., `cookie_secure: true`, `cookie_httponly: true`).
6.  **Database Connection (Skeleton Setup):**  Verify that the database connection is configured securely, using environment variables for credentials. The skeleton likely provides a Doctrine configuration; ensure it's hardened.
7. **Configuration Validation (Within Code):** Add code (e.g., in a service provider or a dedicated configuration class) to *validate* the configuration values loaded from the skeleton's files. This is a crucial defense-in-depth step.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):**  Exposing sensitive configuration details (database credentials, API keys).
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):**  Misconfigured file upload settings.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Debug mode enabled in production.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Incorrect permissions or default accounts.

**Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure, RCE, DoS, Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (from High/Critical to Low/Medium).  Hardening the skeleton's configuration is fundamental.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Adjust to your project)
    *   `.env.dist` is used as a template.
    *   `APP_ENV` is set to `prod` in production.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Adjust to your project)
    *   Thorough review and hardening of *all* skeleton-provided configuration files.
    *   Configuration validation within the application code.
    *   Verification of secure session settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Extension/Bundle Management (Within the Skeleton's Ecosystem)](./mitigation_strategies/extensionbundle_management__within_the_skeleton's_ecosystem_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Controlled Installation and Auditing of UVdesk Extensions/Bundles

**Description:**
1.  **Trusted Sources:**  *Only* install extensions/bundles from trusted sources: the official UVdesk marketplace or developers with a proven track record. The skeleton provides the framework for extensions; this strategy controls *what* is added.
2.  **Vetting Process:**  Establish a formal process for vetting extensions *before* installation. This should include:
    *   Checking the extension's reputation and reviews.
    *   Reviewing the extension's update history and security advisories.
    *   Assessing the extension's permissions and required resources.
3.  **Code Review (Ideal):** If the extension's source code is available, perform a security-focused code review *before* installation. This is the most effective way to identify vulnerabilities.
4.  **Regular Updates:**  Keep *all* installed extensions up-to-date. The skeleton provides the update mechanism; use it diligently. Subscribe to security notifications for installed extensions.
5.  **Least Privilege (Extension Configuration):**  Configure extensions to have the *minimum* necessary permissions within the UVdesk system. The skeleton likely provides configuration options for extensions; use them to limit access.
6. **Unused Extensions:** Remove any unused or unnecessary extensions. This reduces the attack surface.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All threats listed in "Secure Coding Practices" (Severity: Varies):** Extensions can introduce *any* type of vulnerability, as they are essentially code additions to the skeleton.
    *   **Backdoors (Severity: Critical):**  Malicious extensions can install backdoors.

**Impact:**
    *   **All threats:** Risk reduced (from High/Critical to Low/Medium, depending on the extension and the rigor of the vetting process).

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Adjust to your project)
    *   Extensions are generally installed from the official marketplace.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Adjust to your project)
    *   Formal vetting process for extensions.
    *   Code reviews of extensions (where possible).
    *   Regular audits of installed extensions and their permissions.
    *   Proactive removal of unused extensions.
