## Attack Tree Path: [[[Leverage Insecure Password Reset Functionality]]](./attack_tree_paths/__leverage_insecure_password_reset_functionality__.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits flaws in the password reset process. This could involve predictable reset tokens, lack of proper email verification, or the ability to intercept reset links.

**Why High-Risk:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to reset any user's password, leading to account takeover and potential access to sensitive data or administrative functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Weak Session Management]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_weak_session_management__.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses insecure methods for managing user sessions. This could involve predictable session IDs, lack of proper session invalidation upon logout, or susceptibility to session fixation attacks.

**Why High-Risk:** An attacker can hijack a legitimate user's session, gaining unauthorized access to their account and privileges without needing their credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Ticket Creation/Reply]]](./attack_tree_paths/__cross-site_scripting__xss__in_ticket_creationreply__.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into ticket content (either during creation or in a reply). When another user views the ticket, this script executes in their browser.

**Why High-Risk:** While the direct impact might be medium, XSS can be used to steal session cookies (leading to account takeover), redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim. It's a prevalent vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[SQL Injection in Skeleton-Specific Queries]]](./attack_tree_paths/__sql_injection_in_skeleton-specific_queries__.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application constructs database queries using unsanitized user input within the skeleton's specific functionalities. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into these inputs, altering the query's logic.

**Why High-Risk:** Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server, leading to a complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Upload Malicious Files (e.g., Web Shells)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__upload_malicious_files__e_g___web_shells___.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application allows users to upload files, and this functionality lacks proper security measures. An attacker uploads a malicious executable file (like a web shell) and then accesses it through the web server.

**Why High-Risk:** Uploading a web shell grants the attacker remote code execution on the server, allowing them to control the application, access sensitive files, and potentially pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Leverage Default Credentials]]](./attack_tree_paths/__leverage_default_credentials__.md)

**Attack Vector:** The UVDesk Community Skeleton comes with default administrative credentials that are not changed during the initial setup.

**Why High-Risk:** This is a very low-effort attack with a high impact. If default credentials are not changed, an attacker can gain immediate administrative access to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Access Administrative Panel with Default Credentials]]](./attack_tree_paths/__access_administrative_panel_with_default_credentials__.md)

**Attack Vector:** Using the default credentials, the attacker logs into the administrative panel of the application.

**Why High-Risk:** Gaining access to the administrative panel provides full control over the application, allowing the attacker to manage users, modify settings, access sensitive data, and potentially execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Versions of Bundled Libraries]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_versions_of_bundled_libraries__.md)

**Attack Vector:** The UVDesk Community Skeleton uses third-party libraries that have known security vulnerabilities. If these libraries are not kept up-to-date, attackers can exploit these publicly known vulnerabilities.

**Why High-Risk:** This is a common attack vector, and exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available. Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts, including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Bypass Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms]]](./attack_tree_paths/__bypass_authenticationauthorization_mechanisms__.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a broader category encompassing various techniques to circumvent the application's login and access control systems. This could involve exploiting flaws in the authentication logic, session management, or authorization checks.

**Why High-Risk:** Successfully bypassing authentication grants unauthorized access to the application's functionalities and data, potentially leading to further exploitation and compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Inject Malicious Code/Scripts]]](./attack_tree_paths/__inject_malicious_codescripts__.md)

**Attack Vector:** This encompasses techniques like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection, where attackers inject malicious code into the application's data or execution flow.

**Why High-Risk:** Successful injection attacks can lead to a wide range of impacts, from stealing user credentials and performing actions on their behalf to gaining direct access to the database and potentially the server.
