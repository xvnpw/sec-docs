# Attack Surface Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Attack Surface: [Default Installation Routes and Setup Process](./attack_surfaces/default_installation_routes_and_setup_process.md)

* **Description:**  Temporary or less secure routes and functionalities are often present during the initial setup phase of an application.
    * **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The skeleton likely provides a default setup process with specific routes to configure the application (database, admin user, etc.). These routes might have weaker security measures intended for initial use only.
    * **Example:** An attacker might discover and access the `/install` or `/setup` route after deployment, potentially allowing them to reconfigure the application or gain administrative access if not properly disabled or protected.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, including data access, modification, and administrative control.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Remove or disable setup/install routes immediately after successful installation.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for any setup-related functionalities.
        * Ensure the setup process does not expose sensitive information unnecessarily.

## Attack Surface: [Default Administrative Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_administrative_credentials.md)

* **Description:**  The skeleton might include default credentials for administrative accounts to facilitate initial setup and testing.
    * **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The skeleton might pre-configure an administrative user with a default username (e.g., `admin`) and password (e.g., `password` or `123456`).
    * **Example:** An attacker could try common default credentials to log in to the administrative panel and gain full control over the application.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, including data access, modification, and administrative control.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Force users to change default administrative credentials during the initial setup process.
        * Avoid including any default credentials in the skeleton code itself.
        * Implement strong password policies and enforce their use.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configuration of Bundles/Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configuration_of_bundlesdependencies.md)

* **Description:** Pre-configured bundles or dependencies might have default settings that are less secure or expose unnecessary functionalities.
    * **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The skeleton includes specific versions of Symfony bundles and other dependencies. Their default configurations might not be optimal for security.
    * **Example:** A debugging tool might be enabled by default in a production environment, leaking sensitive application details.
    * **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerable configuration, this could lead to information disclosure or unauthorized actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Review the default configurations of all included bundles and dependencies.
        * Harden configurations by disabling unnecessary features and setting strong security parameters.
        * Follow security best practices for each specific bundle/dependency.

## Attack Surface: [Example Code and Development-Focused Features Left Enabled](./attack_surfaces/example_code_and_development-focused_features_left_enabled.md)

* **Description:** The skeleton might include example controllers, routes, or debugging tools intended for development but not for production.
    * **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The skeleton provides a starting point, which might include example code to demonstrate functionalities. If not removed, this code could contain vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.
    * **Example:** An example controller might have a route that bypasses authentication or performs actions without proper authorization.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized actions, potential for code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and remove all example code, comments, and development-specific features before deploying to production.
        * Ensure debugging tools and development-only routes are disabled in production environments.
        * Implement proper environment-based configuration management.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Configuration Files or Sensitive Information in Public Directories](./attack_surfaces/exposed_configuration_files_or_sensitive_information_in_public_directories.md)

* **Description:**  Configuration files or other sensitive information might be inadvertently placed in publicly accessible directories.
    * **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The default file structure of the skeleton might place configuration files (like `.env` or files in `config/`) or other sensitive assets in the `public/` directory or a subdirectory within it.
    * **Example:** An attacker could directly access `public/.env` to retrieve database credentials or API keys.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, API keys, and other confidential information, leading to potential account compromise or data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure sensitive configuration files are stored outside the web root and are not directly accessible via HTTP.
        * Configure the web server to block access to sensitive file extensions (e.g., `.env`, `.yaml`).
        * Review the default file structure and move any sensitive files to secure locations.
