# Threat Model Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Threat: [Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/outdated_or_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated third-party libraries *used by the skeleton*. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or data that triggers the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server, leading to data loss, unauthorized access, or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, all modules and functionalities relying on third-party libraries *within the skeleton*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update dependencies using `composer update`.
        *   Utilize tools like `composer audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for used libraries.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling (if provided by the skeleton)](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling__if_provided_by_the_skeleton_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Upload Handling (if provided by the skeleton)
    *   **Description:** If the *skeleton provides* a file upload feature, an attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) or exploit vulnerabilities in the file upload process (e.g., path traversal) to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  File upload controllers, file storage mechanisms, validation logic *within the skeleton*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on file names and types.
        *   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal attacks.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web root.
        *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.
        *   Restrict file sizes and types.
        *   Use secure file storage mechanisms.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Skeleton Components](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_skeleton_components.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Skeleton Components
    *   **Description:** The *skeleton might introduce* its own custom modules, functions, or features that contain security vulnerabilities due to coding errors or design flaws. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include remote code execution, data breaches, or unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Custom controllers, services, entities, or other code specific to the UVdesk Community Skeleton.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Conduct thorough security code reviews of all custom skeleton code.
        *   Implement static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST).
        *   Follow secure coding practices during development.
        *   Encourage community contributions to security audits.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Mechanism for the Skeleton](./threats/insecure_update_mechanism_for_the_skeleton.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Update Mechanism for the Skeleton
    *   **Description:** If the process for updating the *skeleton* is not secure, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code during an update, compromising the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Update scripts, package management integration *within the skeleton*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure updates are delivered over secure channels (HTTPS).
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) for update packages.
        *   Provide clear instructions and warnings about the update process.
