## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Code Vulnerabilities in Ticket Management via Insecure Input Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_code_vulnerabilities_in_ticket_management_via_insecure_input_handling.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injection of malicious payloads (JavaScript for XSS, or code for potential Remote Code Execution via Twig templating engine) into ticket subject or body fields.
*   **Critical Node:** Inject Malicious Payload via Ticket Subject/Body (XSS, potentially RCE via Twig)
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common web vulnerability if input sanitization and output encoding are not properly implemented).
    *   **Impact:** High (Cross-Site Scripting can lead to account compromise, session hijacking, and data theft. Remote Code Execution allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Low (for basic XSS), Medium (for exploiting Twig for RCE, requires more understanding of the framework and server setup).
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (for basic XSS), Medium (for RCE).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (XSS can be detected by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and content security policies. RCE exploitation might be harder to detect initially without specific monitoring).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting Code Vulnerabilities in User Management via Insecure Password Reset Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploiting_code_vulnerabilities_in_user_management_via_insecure_password_reset_mech_a39d1fec.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Predictable or non-expiring password reset tokens allow an attacker to intercept or guess a valid token and reset another user's password.
*   **Critical Node:** Hijack Password Reset Token via Predictability or Lack of Expiration
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (A common vulnerability if password reset token generation and validation are not implemented securely).
    *   **Impact:** High (Account takeover, allowing the attacker to gain access to the victim's account and its associated data and privileges).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depending on the complexity of the token generation mechanism. Easier if tokens are sequential or have predictable patterns).
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring password reset flows for unusual activity or token reuse).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Code Vulnerabilities in User Management via Privilege Escalation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploiting_code_vulnerabilities_in_user_management_via_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating user roles or permissions due to flaws in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized privileges.
*   **Critical Node:** Manipulate User Roles/Permissions due to Insecure Handling
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the complexity and robustness of the RBAC implementation. Vulnerabilities can arise from improper validation or flawed logic).
    *   **Impact:** High (Gaining administrative privileges allows the attacker to perform critical actions, access sensitive data, and potentially compromise the entire application).
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding the application's permission model and identifying exploitable weaknesses).
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires detailed logging and monitoring of user role and permission changes).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Exploiting Code Vulnerabilities in User Management via Default or Weak Administrative Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_exploiting_code_vulnerabilities_in_user_management_via_default_or_weak_administrati_f988f14d.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Utilizing default or easily guessable administrative credentials that were not changed during the initial setup.
*   **Critical Node:** Exploit Default or Weak Administrative Credentials (if any exist in initial setup)
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (This should ideally be addressed during the initial setup process by forcing users to change default credentials). However, it remains a risk if overlooked.
    *   **Impact:** High (Full system compromise, granting the attacker complete control over the application and its data).
    *   **Effort:** Low (Simply trying default or common credentials).
    *   **Skill Level:** Low.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Should be easily detected by monitoring login attempts for default usernames).
