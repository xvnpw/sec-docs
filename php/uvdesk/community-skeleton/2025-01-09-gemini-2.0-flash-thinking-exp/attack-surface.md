# Attack Surface Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Surface: Dependency Vulnerabilities**

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities present in third-party libraries and packages used by the application.
* **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The `community-skeleton`'s `composer.json` file defines the initial set of dependencies. By specifying certain libraries and their versions, the skeleton directly introduces the potential for inheriting vulnerabilities present in those dependencies.
* **Example:** The `community-skeleton`'s `composer.json` includes an outdated version of a Symfony component known to have a critical remote code execution vulnerability.
* **Impact:**  Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the vulnerability.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers should regularly update dependencies specified in the `composer.json` using Composer (`composer update`).
    * Implement dependency scanning tools (e.g., using `composer audit`) to identify and address vulnerabilities in the skeleton's defined dependencies.
    * Carefully review and potentially pin specific dependency versions in `composer.json` to control updates and mitigate risks of unexpected vulnerable updates.

## Attack Surface: [Default Configuration Exposure](./attack_surfaces/default_configuration_exposure.md)

**Attack Surface: Default Configuration Exposure**

* **Description:** Sensitive information (like database credentials, API keys, application secrets) being exposed due to insecure default configurations.
* **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The `community-skeleton` provides initial configuration files (e.g., `.env` or similar) with placeholder values or potentially insecure default settings. These defaults directly contribute to the attack surface if not changed before deployment.
* **Example:** The default `.env` file in the `community-skeleton` contains default database credentials that are easily guessable or publicly known.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, potential data breaches, or the ability to compromise other connected services.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers must change all default configuration values provided by the `community-skeleton`, especially for sensitive information, before deploying to production.
    * Utilize environment variables for sensitive configuration instead of relying on default files provided by the skeleton.
    * Securely manage and restrict access to configuration files introduced by the skeleton.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Routing and Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_routing_and_endpoints.md)

**Attack Surface: Insecure Default Routing and Endpoints**

* **Description:**  Default routes or endpoints provided by the skeleton that are intended for development or debugging but are left accessible in production, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionality.
* **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The `community-skeleton` defines the initial routing structure of the application. These default routes, inherent to the skeleton's structure, can become attack vectors if not properly secured or removed.
* **Example:** A default route like `/install` or `/setup` provided by the `community-skeleton` remains accessible in production, allowing unauthorized users to potentially reconfigure the application.
* **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to administrative functions, or even the ability to reconfigure or compromise the application.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers should meticulously review all default routes defined by the `community-skeleton` and remove or secure any that are not intended for public access in production.
    * Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for sensitive routes introduced by the skeleton.
    * Ensure development-specific routes defined in the skeleton are disabled or only accessible in development environments.

## Attack Surface: [Bundled Development and Debugging Tools](./attack_surfaces/bundled_development_and_debugging_tools.md)

**Attack Surface: Bundled Development and Debugging Tools**

* **Description:** Development tools or libraries included within the skeleton that, if accessible in a production environment, can be exploited for malicious purposes.
* **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The `community-skeleton` might include development-specific tools or libraries for debugging, profiling, or code generation as part of its initial setup. The presence of these tools directly increases the attack surface in production.
* **Example:** The `community-skeleton` includes a debug bar that, if not disabled, allows attackers to view application variables and potentially execute arbitrary code.
* **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, and the ability to manipulate the application's behavior.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers must ensure that all development and debugging tools bundled with the `community-skeleton` are completely removed or disabled before deploying to production.
    * Implement checks to prevent these tools, if not fully removed, from being loaded in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Example Code and Functionality Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/example_code_and_functionality_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Surface: Example Code and Functionality Vulnerabilities**

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in example code or functionalities included within the skeleton for demonstration or initial setup.
* **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The `community-skeleton` may include example controllers, models, or views to illustrate usage. These examples, if containing vulnerabilities, directly introduce those risks into a project built upon the skeleton.
* **Example:** Example user registration code within the `community-skeleton` contains an SQL injection vulnerability that developers might unknowingly integrate into their application.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential compromise of the application.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers should carefully review all example code provided by the `community-skeleton` and avoid directly using it in production without thorough security assessments.
    * Treat example code as a learning resource and implement secure coding practices when developing actual features.
    * Remove or disable any example functionalities included in the `community-skeleton` that are not intended for production use.

## Attack Surface: [Default User Accounts and Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_user_accounts_and_credentials.md)

**Attack Surface: Default User Accounts and Credentials**

* **Description:**  Pre-configured user accounts with default usernames and passwords that are easily guessable or publicly known.
* **How Community-Skeleton Contributes:** The `community-skeleton` might include a default administrative account for initial setup or demonstration purposes. The presence of this default account with known credentials is a direct vulnerability introduced by the skeleton.
* **Example:** The `community-skeleton` includes a default "admin" user with the password "password".
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and its data.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Developers must immediately change or remove any default user accounts and their associated credentials provided by the `community-skeleton` during the initial setup process.
    * Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts created within the application.
