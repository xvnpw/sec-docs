# Threat Model Analysis for uvdesk/community-skeleton

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The `community-skeleton` includes a set of default dependencies defined in its `composer.json` file. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise applications built using the skeleton. This could involve crafting specific inputs or requests that trigger vulnerabilities within these libraries, leading to remote code execution or data breaches.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application and server, data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information, application downtime.

**Affected Component:** `composer.json` (defining default dependencies), potentially specific vulnerable libraries included by default.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   The development team using the skeleton should immediately update all dependencies after project setup using `composer update`.
*   Implement dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in the default dependencies provided by the skeleton.
*   Consider reviewing and potentially replacing default dependencies with more secure alternatives if vulnerabilities are frequently found.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Description:** The `community-skeleton` might ship with default configuration settings that are insecure for production environments. This could include weak default encryption keys, exposed API endpoints, or overly permissive access controls. Attackers could leverage these insecure defaults to gain unauthorized access, decrypt sensitive data, or manipulate the application.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to the application, compromise of user accounts, manipulation of application settings, potential for privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Default configuration files within the skeleton (e.g., `.env` defaults, `config/packages/*.yaml` defaults).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   The development team must thoroughly review and modify all default configurations provided by the skeleton before deploying the application.
*   The skeleton developers should strive to provide secure default configurations or clearly document the need for immediate changes.
*   Utilize environment variables for sensitive configuration instead of hardcoding defaults in configuration files.

## Threat: [Leftover Example Code or Placeholders](./threats/leftover_example_code_or_placeholders.md)

**Description:** The `community-skeleton` might contain example code snippets, commented-out code, or placeholder functionalities intended for demonstration or development purposes. If these are not removed before deployment, attackers could potentially exploit vulnerabilities within this example code or gain unintended access to features not meant for production.

**Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities within the example code, information disclosure through example data or code comments.

**Affected Component:** Controllers, views, templates, routing configurations included as examples in the skeleton.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   The development team must perform a thorough code review and remove all example code, placeholder comments, and unused functionalities provided by the skeleton before deployment.
*   The skeleton developers should clearly mark example code and advise developers to remove it before production.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin/Extension Interfaces (if provided by the skeleton)](./threats/insecure_pluginextension_interfaces__if_provided_by_the_skeleton_.md)

**Description:** If the `community-skeleton` offers a built-in mechanism for plugins or extensions, vulnerabilities in the design or implementation of these interfaces could allow malicious plugins to compromise the core application. Attackers could develop malicious plugins that exploit these vulnerabilities to gain remote code execution or access sensitive data.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data breaches, denial of service through malicious plugins.

**Affected Component:** Plugin management system within the skeleton, plugin API interfaces, extension points defined by the skeleton.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   If the skeleton provides a plugin system, its developers must ensure secure design and implementation of plugin interfaces, including proper input validation and authorization.
*   The development team using the skeleton should implement a secure plugin review and vetting process.
*   Consider sandboxing plugins to limit their access to core application functionalities.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through Default Error Pages](./threats/information_leakage_through_default_error_pages.md)

**Description:** The default error handling configuration within the `community-skeleton` might display verbose error messages that reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, file paths, or database structure. Attackers could use this information to gain a better understanding of the application and identify potential vulnerabilities for further exploitation.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, aiding attackers in identifying attack vectors and understanding the application's architecture.

**Affected Component:** Default error handling configuration within the skeleton.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   The development team must configure custom error pages that provide generic error messages to users.
*   The skeleton developers should ensure that default error configurations do not expose sensitive information in production environments.
*   Implement secure logging mechanisms to record detailed error information for debugging purposes without exposing it publicly.

## Threat: [Outdated Skeleton Itself](./threats/outdated_skeleton_itself.md)

**Description:** If the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` project is not actively maintained and contains known security vulnerabilities, applications built upon it will inherit these vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these known flaws to compromise the application.

**Impact:** Exposure to known vulnerabilities, potential compromise of the application leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** The entire codebase of the `community-skeleton`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   The development team should monitor the `uvdesk/community-skeleton` repository for updates and security advisories.
*   Regularly update to the latest stable version of the skeleton to benefit from security patches.
*   If the skeleton is no longer maintained, consider forking the repository or migrating to a more actively maintained alternative.
