### 3.6. Cache (Optional)

*   **Functionality:**  Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve application response times. Can be used for caching database query results, rendered templates, or other computationally expensive operations.
*   **Technology:**  In-memory data stores like Redis or Memcached are common choices.
*   **Key Interactions:** The application logic interacts with the cache to store (set) and retrieve (get) data based on keys.

### 3.7. Search Index (Optional)

*   **Functionality:**  Provides efficient full-text search capabilities for searching through tickets, knowledge base articles, and other textual data. Enables users to quickly find relevant information.
*   **Technology:**  Popular search engines like Elasticsearch or Solr. Requires indexing data from the database to enable searching.
*   **Key Interactions:** The application logic sends data to the search index for indexing and sends search queries to the index to retrieve relevant results.

## 4. Data Flow

This section illustrates the data flow for several common user interactions, providing a clearer understanding of how data moves through the system.

### 4.1. User Login

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Web Browser"] --> B["Web Server"];
    B --> C["Application Logic"];
    C --> D["Database"];
    D -- "Retrieve User Credentials" --> C;
    C -- "Verify Credentials" --> C;
    C -- "Authentication Success/Failure" --> B;
    B --> A;
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Steps:**

1. The user submits login credentials (username/email and password) through the **Web Browser**.
2. The **Web Browser** sends an HTTPS POST request containing the credentials to the **Web Server**.
3. The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Application Logic**.
4. The **Application Logic** queries the **Database** to retrieve the stored user credentials based on the provided username/email.
5. The **Database** returns the stored user credentials (typically a hashed password).
6. The **Application Logic** compares the provided password (after hashing) with the retrieved hashed password to verify authenticity.
7. The **Application Logic** determines the authentication result (success or failure).
8. The **Application Logic** sends the authentication result back to the **Web Server**, potentially including a session identifier upon successful authentication.
9. The **Web Server** sends an HTTP response back to the **Web Browser**, potentially setting a session cookie for subsequent requests.

### 4.2. Creating a New Ticket

```mermaid

    E -- "Send Notification Email" --> "Recipient(s)";
    C --> F["Cache (Optional)"];
    F -- "Invalidate Relevant Cache" --> C;
    C -- "Success Response" --> B;
    B --> A;
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#ffc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Steps:**

1. The user fills out the new ticket form in the **Web Browser**.
2. The **Web Browser** sends an HTTPS POST request containing the ticket data to the **Web Server**.
3. The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Application Logic**.
4. The **Application Logic** validates the submitted ticket data (e.g., required fields, data formats).
5. The **Application Logic** interacts with the **Database** to store the new ticket information.
6. The **Database** stores the new ticket data.
7. The **Application Logic** interacts with the **Mail Server** to send notification emails to relevant parties (e.g., assigned agents, the ticket creator).
8. The **Mail Server** sends the notification emails.
9. The **Application Logic** (optionally) interacts with the **Cache** to invalidate any cached data related to tickets to ensure data consistency.
10. The **Application Logic** sends a success response back to the **Web Server**.
11. The **Web Server** sends the response back to the **Web Browser**, typically redirecting the user to the newly created ticket.

### 4.3. Searching for Tickets

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Web Browser"] --> B["Web Server"];
    B --> C["Application Logic"];
    C -- "Determine Search Strategy" --> C;
    alt "Search Index Enabled"
        C --> G["Search Index"];
        G -- "Execute Search Query" --> C;
    else "Search Index Disabled"
        C --> D["Database"];
        D -- "Execute Database Query" --> C;
    end
    C -- "Return Search Results" --> B;
    B --> A;
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#cff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Steps:**

1. The user enters their search query in the **Web Browser**.
2. The **Web Browser** sends a request to the **Web Server** containing the search terms.
3. The **Web Server** forwards the request to the **Application Logic**.
4. The **Application Logic** determines the appropriate search strategy based on system configuration (whether a search index is enabled).
5. **If a Search Index is enabled:**
    *   The **Application Logic** sends the search query to the **Search Index**.
    *   The **Search Index** executes the query and returns the relevant ticket IDs.
6. **If a Search Index is disabled:**
    *   The **Application Logic** constructs and executes a search query directly against the **Database**.
    *   The **Database** returns the matching ticket data.
7. The **Application Logic** formats the search results.
8. The **Application Logic** sends the search results back to the **Web Server**.
9. The **Web Server** sends the response to the **Web Browser** for display.

## 5. Security Considerations

This section expands upon the initial security considerations, providing more specific examples of potential threats and mitigation strategies relevant to the UVDesk Community Skeleton.

*   **Session Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Session fixation, session hijacking.
    *   **Mitigations:** Securely generate session IDs, use HTTPOnly and Secure flags for session cookies, implement session timeouts, regenerate session IDs after successful login, consider using anti-CSRF tokens.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   **Threats:** Information leakage through verbose error messages, insufficient logging for security incident analysis.
    *   **Mitigations:** Implement generic error messages for end-users, log detailed error information securely, log security-relevant events (authentication attempts, authorization failures, etc.), regularly review logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
    *   **Mitigations:** Maintain an inventory of all dependencies, regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions, use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
*   **Access Control:**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, privilege escalation.
    *   **Mitigations:** Implement the principle of least privilege, restrict access to sensitive files and configurations, enforce strong authentication and authorization for administrative interfaces.
*   **Email Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Email spoofing, phishing attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks on email communication.
    *   **Mitigations:** Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for the application's domain, use secure connections (TLS) for SMTP communication, sanitize email content to prevent injection attacks.
*   **File Uploads:**
    *   **Threats:** Upload of malicious files (e.g., malware, web shells), path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigations:** Validate file types and sizes, sanitize file names, store uploaded files outside the webroot, prevent direct access to uploaded files, consider using virus scanning on uploaded files.
