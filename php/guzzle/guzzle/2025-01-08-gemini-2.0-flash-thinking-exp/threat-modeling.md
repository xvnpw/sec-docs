# Threat Model Analysis for guzzle/guzzle

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Manipulation](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-controlled input that is used to construct the target URL in a Guzzle request. By injecting malicious URLs, the attacker can force the application's server to make unintended requests. This exploits Guzzle's URL handling when constructing requests.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal systems and data, potential disclosure of sensitive information, exploitation of internal services leading to further compromise, or denial of service of internal resources.

**Affected Guzzle Component:** The `GuzzleHttp\Client` class, specifically the methods used to construct and send requests (e.g., `get()`, `post()`, `request()`) and the URL resolution logic within Guzzle.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data that influences Guzzle request URLs *before* it's passed to Guzzle.
* Use allow-lists of permitted domains or IP addresses for outbound requests within the application logic interacting with Guzzle.
* Avoid directly embedding user input into URLs used by Guzzle. Use parameterized queries or separate configuration for base URLs.

## Threat: [Header Injection](./threats/header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers into Guzzle requests if the application allows user-controlled input to directly set header values in Guzzle's request options. This exploits how Guzzle allows setting arbitrary headers.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities via response splitting, session hijacking, manipulation of cached content leading to misinformation or further attacks.

**Affected Guzzle Component:** The `GuzzleHttp\RequestOptions` array, specifically the `headers` option used when creating requests with the `GuzzleHttp\Client`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly using user input to set HTTP headers in Guzzle requests.
* If setting headers based on user input is absolutely necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of header values against known attack patterns *before* passing them to Guzzle.
* Use predefined header constants where possible when configuring Guzzle requests.

## Threat: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** If Guzzle is configured to disable SSL verification or use insecure TLS protocols through its request options, the application becomes vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This is due to Guzzle's flexibility in configuring TLS behavior.

**Impact:** Confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged with external services are compromised. Potential for data theft, manipulation of communications, and impersonation.

**Affected Guzzle Component:** The `GuzzleHttp\RequestOptions` array, specifically the `verify` and `ssl_key` options that directly control Guzzle's TLS behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Guzzle's SSL verification is enabled (the default) and not explicitly disabled in request options.
* Explicitly configure Guzzle to use secure TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) if needed, rather than relying on defaults that might change.
* Regularly update the system's CA certificates, as Guzzle relies on the underlying system's certificate store.
* Avoid disabling SSL verification in production environments when using Guzzle.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Guzzle Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_guzzle_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Guzzle relies on other libraries (e.g., cURL). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through Guzzle, as Guzzle utilizes their functionality.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from information disclosure and remote code execution to denial of service, affecting the application through Guzzle's use of the vulnerable dependency.

**Affected Guzzle Component:** Indirectly affects Guzzle through its dependencies. Primarily the underlying HTTP client implementation (often cURL) that Guzzle utilizes.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the dependency vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Guzzle and its dependencies to the latest stable versions to patch any known vulnerabilities. Use a dependency management tool to track and manage these updates.
* Implement a process for monitoring security advisories for Guzzle and its dependencies.
* Consider using tools that scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
