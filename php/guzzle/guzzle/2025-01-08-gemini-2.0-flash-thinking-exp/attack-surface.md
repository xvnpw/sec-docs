# Attack Surface Analysis for guzzle/guzzle

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the application to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially targeting internal resources or external systems on their behalf.

**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle's core functionality is making HTTP requests. If user-controlled data is used to construct the request URL within Guzzle without proper validation, it directly enables SSRF.

**Example:**
```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$targetUrl = $_GET['url']; // User-provided URL
$response = $client->get($targetUrl);
```

**Impact:** Access to internal network resources, reading sensitive data, executing arbitrary code on internal systems, denial of service against internal or external services.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation:**  Whitelist allowed destination URLs or domains. Never directly use user input to construct the full URL.
* **URL Parsing and Validation:**  Parse and validate URLs before using them in Guzzle requests.
* **Block Private IP Ranges:** Prevent requests to private IP addresses and localhost.
* **Use a Dedicated Service Account:** Run the application with minimal privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into requests made by the application.

**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle allows setting custom headers using the `headers` option in request methods. If user input is used to construct header values without sanitization, it can lead to header injection.

**Example:**
```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$userAgent = $_GET['user_agent']; // User-provided User-Agent
$response = $client->get('/some-api', [
    'headers' => [
        'User-Agent' => $userAgent,
        'X-Custom-Header' => $_GET['custom_header'] // Potentially malicious
    ]
]);
```

**Impact:** Cache poisoning, session fixation, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if reflected in server responses, bypassing security controls.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Sanitize or escape user input before using it in header values.
* **Avoid User-Controlled Headers:**  Minimize the use of user-provided data in request headers.
* **Use Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries (where applicable for backend interactions triggered by the request).**

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Bodies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_response_bodies.md)

**Description:** If the application deserializes response bodies (e.g., JSON, XML) without proper validation, it can be vulnerable to deserialization attacks if the remote server is compromised or malicious.

**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle fetches the response body, and the application might use functions to deserialize it (e.g., `json_decode`, `simplexml_load`). If the remote server sends malicious serialized data, it can be exploited during deserialization.

**Example:**
```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->get('/api/data');
$data = json_decode($response->getBody()); // Potentially insecure if API is compromised
```

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Validate Response Structure:**  Validate the structure and expected data types of the deserialized data.
* **Use Safe Deserialization Practices:**  If possible, avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources. Consider using safer alternatives or sandboxed environments.
* **Content-Type Verification:** While not foolproof, verify the `Content-Type` header of the response.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cookie Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cookie_handling.md)

**Description:** Improper handling or storage of cookies obtained through Guzzle can expose sensitive information or lead to session hijacking.

**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle automatically handles cookies based on the `Set-Cookie` header in responses. If the application doesn't properly secure these cookies (e.g., using `HttpOnly`, `Secure` flags when setting them on the application's own responses based on data received from Guzzle), they can be vulnerable.

**Example:**
```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
$response = $client->get('/login');
// Guzzle stores cookies automatically. If the application then uses these insecurely...
```

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Configure Cookie Attributes:** When setting cookies in your application based on data received via Guzzle, ensure `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags are used where appropriate.
* **Secure Cookie Storage:**  If storing cookies, use secure storage mechanisms.
* **Limit Cookie Scope:**  Ensure cookies are scoped appropriately to prevent unintended sharing.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks due to Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_due_to_insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** If TLS/SSL certificate verification is disabled or improperly configured, attackers can intercept and modify communication between the application and the remote server.

**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle provides options to control TLS verification. Disabling certificate verification (`'verify' => false`) makes the application vulnerable.

**Example:**
```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client([
    'verify' => false // Insecure!
]);
$response = $client->get('https://vulnerable-api.com');
```

**Impact:** Data breaches, eavesdropping, manipulation of communication.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable Certificate Verification:** Always enable TLS certificate verification (`'verify' => true` or provide a valid CA bundle).
* **Use Strong Cipher Suites:** Configure Guzzle to use strong and up-to-date cipher suites.
* **Keep CA Certificates Updated:** Ensure the system's CA certificate store is up to date.
