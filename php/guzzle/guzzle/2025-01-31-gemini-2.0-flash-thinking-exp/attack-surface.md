# Attack Surface Analysis for guzzle/guzzle

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the application to make requests to unintended locations, often internal resources or external systems, by manipulating the request URI.
*   **Guzzle Contribution:** Guzzle is the HTTP client used to construct and send requests. If the application dynamically builds the request URI using unsanitized user input and uses Guzzle to send it, SSRF becomes possible due to Guzzle's request execution.
*   **Example:** An application takes a URL as user input to fetch an image. If the application uses Guzzle to fetch this URL without validation, an attacker could provide `http://localhost:22/` as input, causing Guzzle to attempt to connect to the application's own SSH service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Access to internal resources not meant to be publicly accessible.
    *   Data exfiltration from internal systems.
    *   Port scanning of internal networks.
    *   Potential for further attacks on internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs *before* using them in Guzzle requests. Use allow-lists of allowed domains or URI schemes.
    *   **URI Parsing and Validation:**  Use robust URI parsing functions to validate the structure and components of the URL before passing it to Guzzle.
    *   **Restrict Outbound Network Access:** Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to limit the application's ability to connect to internal networks or sensitive external resources, regardless of Guzzle usage.
    *   **Disable or Restrict Redirects in Guzzle:**  Carefully control Guzzle's redirect behavior using the `allow_redirects` option. Limit the number of redirects and potentially restrict allowed redirect destinations within Guzzle's configuration.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTTP headers by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct request headers.
*   **Guzzle Contribution:** Guzzle allows setting custom headers in HTTP requests through its request options. If the application uses unsanitized user input to set headers via Guzzle's configuration, header injection is possible due to Guzzle directly applying these headers in the HTTP request.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom "User-Agent" header. If the application directly uses user input for this header in Guzzle's options, an attacker could inject `User-Agent: malicious\r\nHeader-Injection: vulnerable` through Guzzle to inject a custom header.
*   **Impact:**
    *   HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling.
    *   Session Fixation/Hijacking.
    *   Cache Poisoning.
    *   Bypassing security controls that rely on header parsing.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (can escalate to high depending on the application and downstream systems).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided input *before* using it to construct HTTP headers in Guzzle requests. Use allow-lists of allowed characters and header values.
    *   **Header Encoding:**  Properly encode header values to prevent injection of control characters like newline (`\r\n`) before setting them in Guzzle.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Header Construction from User Input in Guzzle:**  Minimize or eliminate the practice of directly using user input to construct headers within Guzzle's request options. If necessary, use predefined header templates and only allow users to populate specific, validated parts.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Injection](./attack_surfaces/request_body_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into the request body by manipulating user-controlled input that is used to construct the request body content.
*   **Guzzle Contribution:** Guzzle is used to send requests with various body types. If the application constructs request bodies using unsanitized user input and sends them via Guzzle, body injection is possible because Guzzle transmits the body as constructed by the application.
*   **Example:** An application sends JSON data to an API endpoint, constructing the JSON from user input. If the input is not sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious JSON structures or data that Guzzle will send, potentially leading to issues on the server-side.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Command Injection (if server-side processing is vulnerable).
    *   SQL Injection (indirectly, if server-side uses body data in queries).
    *   XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (if using XML and server-side parsing is vulnerable).
    *   Data corruption or manipulation on the server-side.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (can escalate to high depending on server-side processing of request bodies).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided input *before* including it in request bodies sent via Guzzle. Validate data types, formats, and ranges.
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape user input appropriately for the specific body format (e.g., JSON, XML, URL encoding) *before* constructing the request body for Guzzle. Use libraries designed for safe data serialization.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege on Server-Side:**  Ensure the server-side application processing the request body is designed to handle unexpected or malicious input gracefully and securely, regardless of how Guzzle sends the data.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Disabling or weakening SSL/TLS verification or using outdated protocols in Guzzle configuration exposes the application to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **Guzzle Contribution:** Guzzle provides options to configure SSL/TLS verification directly in its client options, including disabling it entirely (`verify: false`). Misconfiguring these options within Guzzle directly weakens the security of connections made by Guzzle.
*   **Example:** An application sets `verify: false` in Guzzle client options to bypass SSL certificate validation.  When Guzzle makes requests with this configuration, it becomes vulnerable to MITM attacks because Guzzle is explicitly instructed to skip certificate verification.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data interception and eavesdropping on Guzzle-initiated traffic.
    *   Data manipulation in transit for Guzzle-initiated traffic.
    *   Credential theft during Guzzle-initiated communication.
    *   MITM attacks leading to further compromise through Guzzle's connections.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable SSL/TLS Verification in Guzzle:**  Always enable SSL/TLS certificate verification in Guzzle (`verify: true` or path to CA bundle in Guzzle's options).
    *   **Use Strong TLS Versions in Guzzle:**  Configure Guzzle to use strong and up-to-date TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) through its `version` option if needed, although Guzzle usually defaults to secure versions. Avoid overriding defaults to weaker protocols.
    *   **Proper Certificate Management:**  Ensure proper setup and maintenance of SSL/TLS certificates on both the client and server sides involved in Guzzle communications.
    *   **Avoid Disabling SSL/TLS Verification:** Never disable SSL/TLS verification (`verify: false`) in production environments using Guzzle. Only consider disabling for specific, controlled testing scenarios and ensure it's re-enabled for production.
