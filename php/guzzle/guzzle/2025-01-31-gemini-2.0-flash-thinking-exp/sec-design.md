# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is the Guzzle HTTP client, a PHP library that simplifies sending HTTP requests and integrates with web services.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust and reliable HTTP client for PHP developers.
  - Simplify the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
  - Offer a flexible and extensible library to accommodate various HTTP-related tasks.
  - Maintain compatibility with different PHP versions and environments.
  - Ensure good performance and efficiency for HTTP communication.
  - Foster a strong community and provide ongoing support and updates.

- Business Risks:
  - Vulnerabilities in Guzzle could be exploited by applications using it, leading to security breaches.
  - Performance issues in Guzzle could negatively impact the performance of applications relying on it.
  - Lack of reliability or bugs in Guzzle could cause application failures or unexpected behavior.
  - Incompatibility issues with PHP versions or environments could limit adoption and usage.
  - Security vulnerabilities in dependencies of Guzzle could indirectly affect applications using Guzzle.
  - Malicious contributions to the open-source project could introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting the distribution channels of Guzzle could compromise users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed by maintainers and contributors as part of the open-source development process. (Location: GitHub Pull Requests and Contribution Guidelines)
  - security control: Static analysis tools might be used by developers locally or in CI pipelines, although not explicitly documented. (Location: Implicit in standard software development practices)
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are present in the repository, which helps ensure code correctness and can indirectly contribute to security. (Location: `phpunit.xml.dist` and `tests/` directory)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the open-source community for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential delays in patching reported vulnerabilities due to maintainer workload and release cycles.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on third-party libraries, which may introduce their own vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Guzzle.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and incident response process to handle security issues effectively.
  - security control: Implement input validation and output encoding mechanisms throughout the library to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Consider fuzz testing to discover unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in edge cases.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - requirement: Guzzle itself does not handle authentication directly but provides mechanisms for applications to implement various authentication schemes (e.g., Basic Auth, OAuth).
    - requirement: Ensure that examples and documentation clearly guide developers on how to securely implement authentication when using Guzzle.
  - Authorization:
    - requirement: Guzzle does not handle authorization directly; it is the responsibility of the application and the remote service.
    - requirement: Guzzle should not introduce any mechanisms that could bypass authorization controls implemented by applications or remote services.
  - Input Validation:
    - requirement: Guzzle must validate all inputs, including headers, request parameters, and body data, to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - requirement: Input validation should be applied consistently across all functionalities of the library.
  - Cryptography:
    - requirement: Guzzle should support secure communication protocols like HTTPS/TLS for all network interactions by default.
    - requirement: When handling sensitive data, Guzzle should encourage and facilitate the use of encryption where appropriate (e.g., encrypting request/response bodies when necessary).
    - requirement: Ensure that Guzzle uses secure cryptographic libraries and algorithms for any cryptographic operations it performs internally.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Functionality of PHP applications that rely on Guzzle for HTTP communication.
  - Availability and reliability of web services accessed through Guzzle.
  - Data integrity and confidentiality of information exchanged via HTTP requests made by Guzzle.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data handled by Guzzle depends entirely on the applications using it.
  - Data can range from publicly accessible information to highly sensitive personal data, financial transactions, or confidential business information.
  - Guzzle itself does not store or process application data persistently, but it facilitates the transfer of data over HTTP.
  - The sensitivity level should be assessed in the context of each application that utilizes Guzzle. For applications handling sensitive data, the security of Guzzle becomes critical for protecting that data in transit.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the typical use cases and scenarios where Guzzle is intended to be used? (To better understand the potential attack surface and impact of vulnerabilities).
  - What are the performance requirements and constraints for Guzzle? (To balance security measures with performance considerations).
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) that applications using Guzzle might need to adhere to? (To identify relevant security standards and controls).
  - What is the expected lifespan and maintenance plan for Guzzle? (To understand the long-term security support and update strategy).

- Assumptions:
  - Guzzle is primarily used in server-side PHP applications.
  - Developers using Guzzle are expected to have a basic understanding of HTTP and web security principles.
  - Security is a significant concern for the Guzzle project and its users.
  - The documentation for Guzzle includes guidance on secure usage and best practices.
  - The Guzzle project benefits from community contributions and security feedback.
