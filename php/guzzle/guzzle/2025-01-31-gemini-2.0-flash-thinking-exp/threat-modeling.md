# Threat Model Analysis for guzzle/guzzle

## Threat: [Threat 1: Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical to High)](./threats/threat_1_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_to_high_.md)

*   **Threat:** Outdated Guzzle or Dependency Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities present in an outdated version of the Guzzle library itself or in one of its dependencies. This could be achieved by crafting specific HTTP requests that trigger the vulnerability or by exploiting a vulnerability in a dependency used by Guzzle.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server; Data Breach, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information; Service Disruption, causing the application to become unavailable.
*   **Guzzle Component Affected:** Core Guzzle library (`guzzlehttp/guzzle` package), and its dependencies (e.g., `psr/http-message`, `symfony/deprecation-contracts`, `ralouphie/getallheaders`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Guzzle to the latest stable version.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in Guzzle and its dependencies.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for Guzzle and its dependencies to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   Apply security patches promptly when vulnerabilities are identified and updates are released.

## Threat: [Threat 2: URL Injection leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High)](./threats/threat_2_url_injection_leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___high_.md)

*   **Threat:** URL Injection / Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input that is used to construct the URL for a Guzzle request. By injecting a malicious URL, the attacker can force the application to make requests to unintended destinations, such as internal network resources, localhost, or external malicious servers. This is possible if the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the URL before passing it to Guzzle.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources that are not publicly accessible; Data exfiltration from internal systems; Denial of Service (DoS) by targeting internal services; Port scanning of internal networks; Potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
*   **Guzzle Component Affected:** `Client::request()` method, specifically the `uri` option within the request options array.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user inputs used to construct URLs for Guzzle requests.
    *   Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns if possible.
    *   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs. Instead, use predefined base URLs and append validated parameters.
    *   Utilize network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF by isolating backend services.
    *   Monitor outbound network traffic for unusual or unauthorized requests originating from the application.

## Threat: [Threat 3: HTTP Header Injection (Medium to High)](./threats/threat_3_http_header_injection__medium_to_high_.md)

*   **Threat:** HTTP Header Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into HTTP headers of requests sent by Guzzle. This can occur if user-controlled input is used to set HTTP headers without proper sanitization. By injecting specific headers, an attacker might be able to exploit vulnerabilities on the target server, bypass security controls, or manipulate the application's behavior.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking if session cookies are manipulated; Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if vulnerable headers are reflected in responses; Bypassing security controls based on header checks; Information disclosure through manipulated headers.
*   **Guzzle Component Affected:** `Client::request()` method, specifically the `headers` option within the request options array.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate and sanitize all user inputs used to construct HTTP headers.
    *   Avoid directly using user input to set HTTP headers whenever possible.
    *   Use predefined headers and allow only specific, validated values for dynamic headers.
    *   Implement robust input validation on the server-side application receiving requests to mitigate header injection vulnerabilities on the receiving end as well.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Parameter Injection (Medium to High)](./threats/threat_4_parameter_injection__medium_to_high_.md)

*   **Threat:** Parameter Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates query parameters or request body data sent by Guzzle. If user-controlled input is used to construct query parameters or request bodies without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious parameters or data. This can lead to unintended actions on the remote server if the application logic on the remote end is vulnerable to parameter manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation on the remote server; Unauthorized actions on the remote server; Information disclosure from the remote server; Potential for further exploitation of the remote application.
*   **Guzzle Component Affected:** `Client::request()` method, specifically the `query`, `form_params`, and `json` options within the request options array.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate and sanitize all user inputs used to construct query parameters and request body data.
    *   Use parameterized requests or prepared statements on the server-side application receiving requests to prevent parameter injection vulnerabilities on the receiving end.
    *   Implement robust input validation on the server-side application to handle unexpected or malicious parameters.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing APIs and limit the impact of parameter manipulation.

## Threat: [Threat 5: Insecure TLS Configuration (High)](./threats/threat_5_insecure_tls_configuration__high_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure TLS Configuration
*   **Description:** Misconfiguring TLS settings in Guzzle, such as disabling TLS certificate verification or using weak cipher suites, can expose communication to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept and potentially modify communication between the application and external services if TLS is not properly configured.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive communication; Credential theft if authentication data is transmitted over insecure connections; Data manipulation, allowing attackers to alter data in transit.
*   **Guzzle Component Affected:** `RequestOptions::verify`, `RequestOptions::ssl_key`, `RequestOptions::cert`, and other TLS related options within the request options array.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always enable TLS certificate verification** (`'verify' => true` or path to CA bundle).
    *   Use strong cipher suites and TLS protocols. Let Guzzle and underlying SSL libraries handle cipher selection by default if possible, or explicitly configure strong, modern cipher suites.
    *   Ensure that the system's CA certificate store is up-to-date.
    *   Avoid disabling TLS verification unless absolutely necessary for testing in controlled environments, and never in production.
    *   Properly manage SSL certificates and private keys if client certificates are used.

## Threat: [Threat 6: Proxy Misconfiguration (Medium to High)](./threats/threat_6_proxy_misconfiguration__medium_to_high_.md)

*   **Threat:** Proxy Misconfiguration
*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured proxies in Guzzle can expose internal services or lead to unintended routing of traffic. If a proxy is configured to bypass security controls or route traffic through untrusted networks, it can create security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of internal network resources through misconfigured proxies; Data exfiltration through unintended proxy routing; Bypassing security controls if proxies are used to circumvent security measures.
*   **Guzzle Component Affected:** `RequestOptions::proxy` option within the request options array.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely configure and manage proxy settings in Guzzle.
    *   Use proxies only when necessary and for intended purposes.
    *   Implement strict access control and authentication for proxy servers.
    *   Regularly review and audit proxy configurations to ensure they are secure and aligned with security policies.
    *   Use network segmentation to limit the impact of proxy misconfigurations.
