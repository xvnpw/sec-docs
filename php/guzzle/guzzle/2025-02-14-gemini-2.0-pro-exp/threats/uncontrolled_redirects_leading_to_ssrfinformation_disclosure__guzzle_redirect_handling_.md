# Deep Analysis: Uncontrolled Redirects Leading to SSRF/Information Disclosure (Guzzle)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat of uncontrolled redirects in the context of Guzzle HTTP client usage, identify the specific vulnerabilities, and provide actionable, detailed mitigation strategies for developers.  We aim to go beyond basic recommendations and provide concrete implementation guidance.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Guzzle HTTP Client:**  The primary scope is the `GuzzleHttp\Client` and its redirect handling mechanisms.
*   **SSRF and Information Disclosure:**  We will analyze how uncontrolled redirects can lead to these two specific attack vectors.
*   **Configuration and Middleware:**  We will examine both built-in Guzzle configuration options and the creation of custom middleware for robust protection.
*   **PHP Environment:**  The analysis assumes a PHP environment where Guzzle is used.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Understanding:**  Clearly define the threat, its mechanics, and potential impact.
2.  **Guzzle's Redirect Mechanism:**  Deep dive into how Guzzle handles redirects by default and with different configuration options.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify specific scenarios where Guzzle's default or misconfigured behavior can be exploited.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for implementing each mitigation strategy, including code examples and best practices.
5.  **Testing and Validation:**  Outline how to test the implemented mitigations to ensure their effectiveness.

## 2. Threat Understanding

### 2.1. Threat Description

An attacker controls a service that the application interacts with using Guzzle.  When the application makes a request to the attacker's service, the service responds with an HTTP redirect (e.g., 301, 302, 307, 308).  Instead of redirecting to a legitimate external resource, the attacker crafts the `Location` header in the redirect response to point to:

*   **Internal Services:**  `http://localhost:8080/admin`, `http://192.168.1.10:6379` (Redis), `http://127.0.0.1:27017` (MongoDB), etc.  This is the core of SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).
*   **Sensitive Files:**  `file:///etc/passwd`, `file:///path/to/secret.key`.  This can lead to information disclosure.
*   **Cloud Metadata Services:** `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS, Azure, GCP).  This is a common SSRF target in cloud environments.

If Guzzle is not configured to restrict redirects, it will automatically follow these malicious redirects, effectively making requests on behalf of the attacker to these internal or sensitive resources.

### 2.2. Impact

*   **SSRF:**  The attacker can use the application as a proxy to access internal services, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The attacker can read sensitive files or access internal network information, revealing details about the application's infrastructure and potentially exposing credentials or other secrets.
*   **Bypass Security Controls:**  Internal services often have weaker security controls than externally facing services, making them easier targets for the attacker.

## 3. Guzzle's Redirect Mechanism

Guzzle's redirect handling is controlled by the `allow_redirects` option in the `GuzzleHttp\Client` configuration.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **`allow_redirects` (Default: `true`):**  By default, Guzzle *will* follow redirects.  This is convenient but dangerous without further restrictions.
*   **`allow_redirects` (Boolean `false`):**  Disables redirects entirely.  Guzzle will *not* follow any redirects and will return the redirect response to the application.  This is the safest option if redirects are not needed.
*   **`allow_redirects` (Array):**  Provides fine-grained control over redirect behavior:
    *   **`max` (int):**  Specifies the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: 5).  This is a crucial security setting.
    *   **`strict` (bool):**  If `true`, redirects will use the same request method as the original request.  If `false` (default), a POST request might be redirected to a GET request.  Setting this to `true` is generally recommended.
    *   **`referer` (bool):**  Whether to add the `Referer` header on redirect.
    *   **`protocols` (array):**  Specifies the allowed protocols for redirects (default: `['http', 'https']`).  This can be used to prevent redirects to `file://` URLs, for example.
    *   **`track_redirects` (bool):** If true, track the redirect history.

**Example (Default Behavior - Vulnerable):**

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;

$client = new Client(); // allow_redirects is true by default
$response = $client->request('GET', 'http://attacker.com/redirect');
// Guzzle will follow the redirect, potentially to an internal resource.
```

**Example (Disabled Redirects - Safe, but may break functionality):**

```php
$client = new Client(['allow_redirects' => false]);
$response = $client->request('GET', 'http://attacker.com/redirect');
// $response will be the 302 redirect response, not the final destination.
```

**Example (Limited and Strict Redirects - More Secure):**

```php
$client = new Client([
    'allow_redirects' => [
        'max'       => 3,  // Limit to 3 redirects
        'strict'    => true, // Maintain the original request method
        'protocols' => ['https'] // Only allow HTTPS redirects
    ]
]);
$response = $client->request('GET', 'http://attacker.com/redirect');
// More secure, but still vulnerable to redirects within the allowed protocols.
```

## 4. Vulnerability Analysis

The primary vulnerability lies in the combination of:

1.  **Default `allow_redirects` behavior:**  Guzzle follows redirects by default.
2.  **Lack of validation of the `Location` header:**  Guzzle does not, by default, validate the target of the redirect against any security policy.

This means that even with `max` and `strict` set, an attacker can still redirect to an internal service *if* that service is accessible via HTTP or HTTPS (depending on the `protocols` setting).  For example, if an internal service is running on `http://localhost:8080`, and the attacker redirects to that URL, Guzzle will follow it even with `max` and `strict` configured.

## 5. Mitigation Strategies

### 5.1. Limit Redirects (`max`)

*   **Implementation:**  Set a low, reasonable maximum number of redirects.  This prevents infinite redirect loops and limits the attacker's ability to chain redirects.

    ```php
    $client = new Client([
        'allow_redirects' => ['max' => 3] // Or even lower, if possible
    ]);
    ```

*   **Limitations:**  Does not prevent redirects to internal services within the allowed redirect count.

### 5.2. Strict Redirects (`strict`)

*   **Implementation:**  Ensure that redirects maintain the original request method.  This prevents unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities related to method changes.

    ```php
    $client = new Client([
        'allow_redirects' => ['strict' => true]
    ]);
    ```

*   **Limitations:**  Does not prevent redirects to internal services.

### 5.3. Restrict Protocols (`protocols`)

*   **Implementation:**  Only allow `https` redirects. This prevents redirects to `file://` or other potentially dangerous protocols.

    ```php
    $client = new Client([
        'allow_redirects' => ['protocols' => ['https']]
    ]);
    ```

*   **Limitations:**  Does not prevent redirects to internal services that use HTTPS.

### 5.4. Whitelist Redirect Targets (Custom Middleware) - **The Most Robust Solution**

This is the most effective mitigation strategy.  It involves creating a custom Guzzle middleware that intercepts redirect responses *before* Guzzle follows them and validates the `Location` header against a whitelist or other security policy.

*   **Implementation:**

    1.  **Create a Middleware Class:**

        ```php
        namespace App\Middleware;

        use Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface;
        use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

        class RedirectValidationMiddleware
        {
            private $allowedDomains;

            public function __construct(array $allowedDomains)
            {
                $this->allowedDomains = $allowedDomains;
            }

            public function __invoke(callable $handler)
            {
                return function (RequestInterface $request, array $options) use ($handler) {
                    return $handler($request, $options)->then(
                        function (ResponseInterface $response) use ($request, $options) {
                            if ($response->getStatusCode() >= 300 && $response->getStatusCode() < 400 && $response->hasHeader('Location')) {
                                $location = $response->getHeaderLine('Location');
                                $urlParts = parse_url($location);

                                // Check if the redirect is absolute and to an allowed domain
                                if (isset($urlParts['host']) && !in_array($urlParts['host'], $this->allowedDomains)) {
                                    // Log the attempted redirect for auditing
                                    error_log("Blocked redirect to: " . $location);

                                    // Throw an exception or return a custom error response
                                    throw new \Exception("Redirect to disallowed domain: " . $urlParts['host']);
                                    // OR: return a 400 Bad Request response
                                    // return new \GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Response(400, [], 'Invalid redirect');
                                }
                                // Check for relative redirects and ensure they are safe
                                elseif (!isset($urlParts['host'])) {
                                     //Implement logic to handle relative redirects.
                                     //For example, combine with the original request's base URI and check the resulting absolute URL.
                                     $baseUri = $request->getUri();
                                     $absoluteUrl = \GuzzleHttp\Psr7\UriResolver::resolve($baseUri, new \GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Uri($location));
                                     $absoluteUrlParts = parse_url((string)$absoluteUrl);

                                     if (isset($absoluteUrlParts['host']) && !in_array($absoluteUrlParts['host'], $this->allowedDomains)) {
                                         error_log("Blocked relative redirect to: " . (string)$absoluteUrl);
                                         throw new \Exception("Redirect to disallowed domain: " . $absoluteUrlParts['host']);
                                     }
                                }
                            }
                            return $response;
                        }
                    );
                };
            }
        }
        ```

    2.  **Add the Middleware to the Guzzle Client:**

        ```php
        use GuzzleHttp\Client;
        use GuzzleHttp\HandlerStack;
        use App\Middleware\RedirectValidationMiddleware;

        // Define your allowed domains
        $allowedDomains = ['example.com', 'api.example.com'];

        // Create the middleware
        $redirectMiddleware = new RedirectValidationMiddleware($allowedDomains);

        // Create a handler stack and push the middleware
        $handlerStack = HandlerStack::create();
        $handlerStack->push($redirectMiddleware);

        // Create the Guzzle client with the handler stack
        $client = new Client([
            'handler' => $handlerStack,
            'allow_redirects' => [ // Keep allow_redirects enabled, but controlled by middleware
                'max' => 5,
                'strict' => true,
                'protocols' => ['https']
            ]
        ]);

        // Now, any requests made with $client will have their redirects validated.
        ```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   The `RedirectValidationMiddleware` class takes an array of allowed domains in its constructor.
    *   The `__invoke` method is called for each request.  It uses a "promise" (`then`) to intercept the response *after* Guzzle has processed it (including following redirects).
    *   It checks if the response is a redirect (status code 3xx) and has a `Location` header.
    *   It parses the `Location` header using `parse_url` to extract the host.
    *   It checks if the host is in the `$allowedDomains` array.  If not, it throws an exception (you could also return a custom error response).
    *   It includes handling for relative redirects, resolving them to absolute URLs before validation.
    *   The middleware is added to the Guzzle client using a `HandlerStack`.

*   **Advantages:**
    *   **Fine-grained Control:**  You have complete control over which redirects are allowed.
    *   **Prevents SSRF and Information Disclosure:**  Effectively blocks redirects to internal or sensitive resources.
    *   **Flexibility:**  You can easily adapt the validation logic to your specific security requirements (e.g., using regular expressions, checking paths, etc.).

*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   **Requires More Code:**  You need to write and maintain the middleware.
    *   **Potential for Errors:**  Incorrectly implemented middleware can introduce new vulnerabilities.

### 5.5. Disable Redirects Entirely

If your application does not require following redirects, the simplest and safest option is to disable them completely:

```php
$client = new Client(['allow_redirects' => false]);
```

This eliminates the risk of uncontrolled redirects entirely.

## 6. Testing and Validation

After implementing any of these mitigation strategies, it's crucial to test them thoroughly:

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Create unit tests for your Guzzle client configuration and middleware (if applicable).  These tests should simulate redirect responses from a mock server and verify that the expected behavior occurs (e.g., redirects are followed or blocked as intended).
2.  **Integration Tests:**  Test the integration of your application with external services, including scenarios where redirects might occur.
3.  **Security Testing (Penetration Testing):**  Conduct penetration testing to specifically target the redirect handling functionality.  Try to exploit potential SSRF or information disclosure vulnerabilities.  Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to craft malicious redirect responses.
4. **Negative Testing:** Specifically test with redirects to:
    *   Internal IP addresses (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.x.x`).
    *   Internal hostnames (e.g., `localhost`, `internal.service`).
    *   Cloud metadata endpoints (e.g., `169.254.169.254`).
    *   File URLs (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`).
    *   Different ports on the local machine.
    *   Long redirect chains.
    *   Redirects that change the request method (if `strict` is not enabled).

## 7. Conclusion

Uncontrolled redirects in Guzzle can lead to serious security vulnerabilities like SSRF and information disclosure. While Guzzle provides some built-in configuration options for managing redirects, the most robust solution is to implement a custom middleware that validates redirect targets against a whitelist or other security policy. Thorough testing and validation are essential to ensure the effectiveness of any implemented mitigation. By following the strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these vulnerabilities and build more secure applications.
