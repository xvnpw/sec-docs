## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltration.md)

*   **1.1. Manipulate Redirects [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1.1. Exploit insufficient validation of `Location` header (CVE-2023-29197 related) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  If the application uses an unpatched version of Guzzle or doesn't properly validate the `Location` header in redirect responses, an attacker can craft a malicious redirect that leads to data exfiltration.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if patched), Medium (if unpatched and validation is weak)
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.1.2. Bypass redirect restrictions [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** If `strict_redirects` is not used or is misconfigured, Guzzle might follow redirects that change the request method, protocol, or host, leading to data leakage.

        *   **1.1.2.1. Change request method on redirect (POST to GET) [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:**  A POST request containing sensitive data in the body is redirected to a GET request.  The POST data is then appended to the URL, potentially exposing it to the attacker or logging systems.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

        *   **1.1.2.2. Change protocol on redirect (HTTPS to HTTP) [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:**  A request initially made over HTTPS is redirected to HTTP.  This exposes the entire request (including headers, cookies, and body) in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High

        *   **1.1.2.3. Change Host on redirect [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:**  The request is redirected to a different host controlled by the attacker.  Sensitive headers (e.g., authorization headers, cookies) intended for the original host are sent to the attacker's server.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.1.3. Open Redirect [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The application uses user-supplied input to construct the URL for Guzzle requests without proper validation.

        *   **1.1.3.1. Application passes user input directly to Guzzle [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:**  The attacker can provide a URL that redirects the user to a malicious site, potentially leading to phishing or data theft.  This is a general web vulnerability, but it's exacerbated by Guzzle's automatic redirect handling if not configured correctly.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.3. Exploit Request Options**

    *   **1.3.1. `debug` option enabled in production [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The `debug` option in Guzzle logs detailed information about requests and responses, including headers and potentially sensitive data in the request body.

        *   **1.3.1.1. Sensitive information logged [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:**  If `debug` is enabled in a production environment, this information might be written to logs that are accessible to attackers, leading to data exfiltration.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be a rare configuration error)
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Low

*   **1.4. Exploit Proxy Configuration**

    *   **1.4.2. Application's proxy configuration is vulnerable to injection [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The application allows the attacker to control the proxy server used by Guzzle.

        *   **1.4.2.1. Attacker can specify an arbitrary proxy server [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:**  The attacker can direct all of the application's outbound traffic through a malicious proxy, allowing them to intercept, modify, or block requests and responses.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a significant vulnerability)
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.5. Exploit SSL/TLS Configuration [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.5.1. `verify` option set to `false` [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Disables SSL/TLS certificate verification.

        *   **1.5.1.1. MITM attack due to accepting any certificate [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:**  Guzzle will accept any certificate presented by the server, even if it's invalid or self-signed.  This makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the communication between the application and the server.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be a rare configuration error)
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [2. System Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/2__system_manipulation.md)

*   **2.1. SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The application allows an attacker to control the URL used by Guzzle, enabling them to make requests to internal or otherwise inaccessible resources.

    *   **2.1.1. Application allows attacker to control the URL [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** This is the root cause of SSRF vulnerabilities.

        *   **2.1.1.1. Access internal resources [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:**  The attacker can use Guzzle to access internal services, such as metadata services (e.g., AWS metadata service), databases, or administrative interfaces, that are not normally exposed to the public internet.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **2.3. Exploit Proxy Configuration**
    * **2.3.1 Use malicious proxy to modify requests to internal services. [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Description:** Similar to 1.4.2.1, but the impact is focused on manipulating requests *after* they leave the application, potentially targeting internal services that Guzzle is used to interact with.
        * **Likelihood:** Low
        * **Impact:** Very High
        * **Effort:** High
        * **Skill Level:** High
        * **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/4__information_disclosure.md)

*   **4.1. `debug` option enabled (as in 1.3.1) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **4.1.1. Leak request/response details [CRITICAL]:** (Same as 1.3.1.1)
