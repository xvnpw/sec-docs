# Threat Model Analysis for guzzle/guzzle

## Threat: [SSRF via Unvalidated User Input in URL (Direct Guzzle Handling)](./threats/ssrf_via_unvalidated_user_input_in_url__direct_guzzle_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that directly controls the URL used by *Guzzle's request methods*.  The attacker crafts the input to point to an internal server, a sensitive file, or a different external service. This bypasses any *application-level* validation if Guzzle is directly exposed to user-provided URLs.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker can access internal resources, potentially exfiltrating data, modifying configurations, or launching further attacks. They could also use the application as a proxy to attack other external systems.
*   **Affected Guzzle Component:**  `GuzzleHttp\Client::request()`, `GuzzleHttp\Client::get()`, `GuzzleHttp\Client::post()`, etc. (any method that takes a URL as input). The core client functionality where the URL is processed.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Expose Guzzle Directly:**  *Never* allow user input to directly construct the URL passed to Guzzle.  This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Strict Whitelisting (Application Level):** Implement strict whitelisting of allowed URLs or URL patterns *at the application level*, before Guzzle is even involved.
    *   **Parameterization (Application Level):** Use user input only as *parameters* to a pre-defined base URL, never as part of the URL path itself.  This should be handled *before* calling Guzzle.
    *   **Robust URL Validation (Application Level):** If absolutely necessary, use a URL parsing library *before* passing the URL to Guzzle, and validate each component against a strict whitelist.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via MitM Attack (Guzzle TLS Verification Failure)](./threats/data_tampering_via_mitm_attack__guzzle_tls_verification_failure_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic.  If Guzzle's TLS verification is disabled or misconfigured (e.g., `verify` set to `false` or pointing to an invalid CA bundle), the attacker can successfully perform a MitM attack and modify the response data received by Guzzle. This is a direct failure of Guzzle's security mechanisms.
*   **Impact:**  The application processes manipulated data, leading to incorrect results, security breaches, or data corruption. The attacker might gain unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Guzzle Component:**  `GuzzleHttp\Client` configuration (`verify` option), the underlying transport layer responsible for TLS negotiation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for all external communications.
    *   **Strict TLS Verification:** Ensure Guzzle's `verify` option is set to `true` (the default) or points to a valid and up-to-date CA bundle. *Never* disable TLS verification in production.
    *   **Certificate Pinning (Advanced):** For highly sensitive communications, consider certificate pinning, where Guzzle is configured to accept only a specific certificate or public key. This is more complex to manage but provides stronger protection against MitM attacks.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Redirects Leading to SSRF/Information Disclosure (Guzzle Redirect Handling)](./threats/uncontrolled_redirects_leading_to_ssrfinformation_disclosure__guzzle_redirect_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**  A malicious service responds with a redirect that points to an internal or sensitive resource.  If Guzzle's redirect handling is not properly configured, it will follow these redirects, potentially leading to SSRF or information disclosure. This is a direct consequence of how Guzzle handles redirects.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker can access internal resources or use the application as a proxy (SSRF). Information disclosure can reveal internal network structure.
*   **Affected Guzzle Component:**  `GuzzleHttp\Client` configuration (`allow_redirects` option), the internal redirect handling logic within Guzzle.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Redirects:**  Set a maximum number of allowed redirects using the `max` option within `allow_redirects` (e.g., `['max' => 5]`).
    *   **Strict Redirects:** Use the `strict` option within `allow_redirects` to ensure redirects maintain the same request method.
    *   **Whitelist Redirect Targets (Custom Middleware):** Implement a *custom Guzzle middleware* that intercepts redirect responses *before* Guzzle follows them. This middleware should validate the `Location` header against a whitelist or other security policy. Reject redirects to unexpected or untrusted domains. This is the most robust mitigation.

## Threat: [Credential Leakage in Headers/Logs (Guzzle Misconfiguration)](./threats/credential_leakage_in_headerslogs__guzzle_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, tokens) are accidentally included in request headers *due to Guzzle's configuration* or are logged by Guzzle's *own logging mechanisms*. This is a direct result of how Guzzle is set up and used.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains access to sensitive credentials.
*   **Affected Guzzle Component:** `GuzzleHttp\Client` configuration (headers), Guzzle's logging middleware (`GuzzleHttp\Middleware::log`), any custom middleware that interacts with requests/responses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration (Application Level):** Store credentials securely (environment variables, secrets manager).
    *   **Header Review (Application Level):** Carefully review all headers *before* passing them to Guzzle.
    *   **Log Redaction (Guzzle Middleware):** Use Guzzle's middleware capabilities (or create custom middleware) to filter sensitive data *from the request and response objects* *before* they are logged. This is crucial for preventing leakage through Guzzle's own logging.

## Threat: [HTTP Request Smuggling (Due to Guzzle and Proxy Interaction)](./threats/http_request_smuggling__due_to_guzzle_and_proxy_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:** If Guzzle is used behind a proxy/load balancer, and there's a discrepancy in how HTTP/1.1 is handled (especially `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length`), an attacker can craft a request that's interpreted differently by the proxy and Guzzle. While not *solely* Guzzle's fault, Guzzle's handling of these headers is a critical part of the attack chain.
*   **Impact:** Bypass security controls, access unauthorized resources, cache poisoning.
*   **Affected Guzzle Component:** `GuzzleHttp\Client`, specifically how it handles `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers, and how it interacts with the underlying transport.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if applicable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Consistent HTTP/1.1 Handling:** Ensure all components (proxies, load balancers, *and Guzzle*) handle HTTP/1.1 consistently.
    *   **Prefer HTTP/2:** Use HTTP/2, which is less susceptible to request smuggling.
    *   **WAF:** A Web Application Firewall can help detect and block these attempts.
    *   **Avoid Ambiguous Headers (Guzzle Configuration):** Ensure Guzzle is *not configured* to send ambiguous or conflicting headers. This requires careful review of how headers are set.
