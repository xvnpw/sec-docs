# Attack Surface Analysis for guzzle/guzzle

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks the application into making requests to unintended destinations, including internal systems or external resources the attacker controls.
**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle, by design, makes requests to *any* URL provided.  It doesn't inherently restrict destinations. This is the core of the SSRF risk with Guzzle.
**Example:**
    *   User input: `http://example.com/image?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS metadata endpoint)
    *   Guzzle makes a request to the internal AWS metadata service, potentially exposing sensitive instance information.
**Impact:**
    *   Access to internal systems and data.
    *   Bypassing firewalls and network segmentation.
    *   Execution of arbitrary code on internal servers (in severe cases).
    *   Data exfiltration.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Allow-list:**  Maintain a strict allow-list (whitelist) of permitted domains or URLs.  Reject any request that doesn't match the allow-list.  This is the *most effective* mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate *all* user-supplied data used to construct URLs.  Ensure it conforms to the expected format (e.g., a valid domain name, a specific path structure).
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Implement network segmentation to limit the application's ability to access internal resources.
    *   **Disable Redirection (if possible):** If redirects are not essential, set `allow_redirects` to `false` in Guzzle's configuration.
    *   **Validate Redirect URLs:** If redirects *are* necessary, validate the redirect URL against the allow-list *before* following it.
    *   **Avoid using user input for host:** Do not construct host from user input.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTTP headers into requests made by Guzzle, potentially manipulating the behavior of the target server or intermediary proxies.
**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle allows setting arbitrary headers via its request options.  If user input is used to construct header values without proper sanitization, injection is possible.
**Example:**
    *   User input (in a "X-Forwarded-For" field): `127.0.0.1\r\nEvil-Header: malicious_value`
    *   Guzzle sends a request with the injected `Evil-Header`.
**Impact:**
    *   Session hijacking (if injecting `Cookie` headers).
    *   Cache poisoning (if manipulating cache-control headers).
    *   Bypassing access controls (if manipulating authorization headers).
    *   Request smuggling (in complex scenarios with proxies).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Header Value Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize *all* user-supplied data used in header values.  Remove or escape any characters that could be used for injection (e.g., newline characters, carriage returns).
    *   **Header Name Allow-list:**  If possible, maintain an allow-list of permitted header names.  Reject any requests that include unexpected headers.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Headers:** Minimize the use of dynamically generated headers based on user input.

## Attack Surface: [Disabled SSL/TLS Verification](./attack_surfaces/disabled_ssltls_verification.md)

**Description:** Disabling SSL/TLS certificate verification (`verify: false` in Guzzle) allows Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle provides the `verify` option to control SSL/TLS verification.  Setting it to `false` disables this crucial security check, making MitM attacks trivial.
**Example:**
    *   `$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client(['verify' => false]);`
    *   An attacker intercepts the connection and presents a fake certificate.  Guzzle doesn't detect this.
**Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of communication:  The attacker can intercept, decrypt, and modify all data transmitted between the application and the server.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Enable Verification:**  *Never* disable SSL/TLS verification in production.  Set `verify` to `true` (the default).
    *   **Use a Trusted CA Bundle:**  Ensure Guzzle is using an up-to-date and trusted certificate authority (CA) bundle.

## Attack Surface: [Using Vulnerable Guzzle or Dependency Versions](./attack_surfaces/using_vulnerable_guzzle_or_dependency_versions.md)

**Description:** Using an outdated version of Guzzle or its dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
**How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle, like any software, can have vulnerabilities. Its dependencies can also have vulnerabilities that Guzzle's functionality exposes.
**Example:** Using an old Guzzle version with a known CVE that allows for request manipulation.
**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution. High-severity vulnerabilities in HTTP libraries are common.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Guzzle and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (e.g., Composer, pip) to track and update dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
