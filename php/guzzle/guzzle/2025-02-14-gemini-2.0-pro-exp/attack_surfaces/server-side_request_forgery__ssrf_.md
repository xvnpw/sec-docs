# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) with Guzzle

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the SSRF attack surface presented by the use of Guzzle within our application, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the general recommendations.  We aim to provide developers with clear guidance on how to securely use Guzzle to prevent SSRF attacks.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Guzzle's role in SSRF:** How Guzzle's features (or lack thereof) contribute to the SSRF vulnerability.
*   **User-provided input:**  All scenarios where user-supplied data influences the URL Guzzle uses for requests. This includes direct URL input, parameters that modify the URL, and headers that might affect request routing.
*   **Internal and external targets:**  Both internal network resources (e.g., metadata services, internal APIs) and external resources controlled by an attacker.
*   **Redirects:**  The handling of HTTP redirects and their potential exploitation in SSRF.
*   **Specific Guzzle configuration options:**  How Guzzle's configuration can be used to mitigate or exacerbate SSRF risks.
*   **Code examples:** Illustrative code snippets demonstrating both vulnerable and secure usage patterns.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General web application security principles unrelated to SSRF.
*   Vulnerabilities in other libraries or components, except where they directly interact with Guzzle's SSRF risk.
*   Denial-of-service attacks that might be facilitated by Guzzle, unless they are directly related to SSRF.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Review Guzzle Documentation:**  Thoroughly examine the official Guzzle documentation, focusing on request options, redirect handling, and any security-related notes.
2.  **Code Review:**  Analyze existing application code that uses Guzzle to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities.  This includes searching for instances where user input is used to construct URLs.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop specific threat scenarios based on how the application uses Guzzle and the types of data it handles.
4.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  For each identified threat scenario, analyze the specific vulnerability, including the attack vector, potential impact, and likelihood of exploitation.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  For each vulnerability, propose one or more concrete mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration recommendations.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:** Suggest testing strategies to verify the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Guzzle's Core Functionality and SSRF

Guzzle's primary function is to send HTTP requests.  It's designed to be flexible and powerful, allowing developers to make requests to any URL.  This flexibility is the root cause of the SSRF risk.  Guzzle, by itself, does *not* perform any validation or restriction on the target URL unless explicitly configured to do so.

### 2.2. User Input as the Primary Attack Vector

The most common SSRF vulnerability arises when user-supplied data is used, directly or indirectly, to construct the URL that Guzzle uses.  This can occur in various ways:

*   **Direct URL Input:**  The most obvious case, where the user provides a complete URL (e.g., in a form field or API parameter).
*   **Partial URL Input:**  The user provides part of the URL, such as a domain name, path, or query parameter, which is then combined with other components to form the final URL.
*   **Indirect Input:**  The user provides data that is *not* a URL, but is used to *look up* a URL (e.g., an ID that is used to retrieve a URL from a database).  If the database is compromised or the lookup logic is flawed, this can lead to SSRF.
*   **Headers:**  Less common, but an attacker might be able to influence the request through headers like `X-Forwarded-Host` or `Host`, potentially redirecting the request to a malicious server.

### 2.3. Threat Scenarios and Vulnerability Analysis

Here are some specific threat scenarios and their analysis:

**Scenario 1: Image Proxy with Unvalidated URL**

*   **Description:**  The application acts as an image proxy, fetching images from URLs provided by the user.
*   **Vulnerable Code (PHP):**

    ```php
    use GuzzleHttp\Client;

    $client = new Client();
    $imageUrl = $_GET['url']; // User-provided URL
    $response = $client->request('GET', $imageUrl);
    // ... (process and display the image)
    ```

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker provides a URL pointing to an internal resource, such as `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` (AWS metadata) or `http://localhost:8080/admin`.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive internal data, potential access to internal services.
*   **Likelihood:** High. This is a classic SSRF scenario.

**Scenario 2:  Partial URL Construction with User Input**

*   **Description:**  The application constructs a URL by combining a base URL with a user-provided path.
*   **Vulnerable Code (PHP):**

    ```php
    use GuzzleHttp\Client;

    $client = new Client();
    $base_url = 'https://api.example.com';
    $user_path = $_GET['path']; // User-provided path
    $response = $client->request('GET', $base_url . $user_path);
    // ...
    ```

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker provides a path that, when combined with the base URL, results in a request to an unintended destination.  For example, `path=../../../../etc/passwd` (path traversal) or `path=@evil.com/malicious.php` (redirect to an attacker-controlled server).
*   **Impact:**  Access to sensitive files, execution of arbitrary code on the attacker's server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  Depends on the specific validation and sanitization applied to the user-provided path.

**Scenario 3:  Redirect Exploitation**

*   **Description:**  The application follows redirects by default, and the attacker provides a URL that redirects to an internal resource.
*   **Vulnerable Code (PHP):**

    ```php
    use GuzzleHttp\Client;

    $client = new Client(); // allow_redirects is true by default
    $imageUrl = $_GET['url']; // User-provided URL
    $response = $client->request('GET', $imageUrl);
    // ...
    ```

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker provides a URL like `http://attacker.com/redirect.php`, which contains a `Location` header redirecting to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive internal data.
*   **Likelihood:** High, if redirects are enabled and not validated.

**Scenario 4: Using user input for host**
* **Description:** The application constructs a URL by using user input for host.
* **Vulnerable Code (PHP):**
```php
    use GuzzleHttp\Client;

    $client = new Client();
    $user_host = $_GET['host']; // User-provided host
    $response = $client->request('GET', 'https://' . $user_host . '/api');
```
* **Attack Vector:** The attacker provides host that points to internal resource or attacker controlled server.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive internal data, potential access to internal services or execution of arbitrary code on the attacker's server.
* **Likelihood:** High.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies (with Code Examples)

**1. Strict URL Allow-list (Whitelist)**

This is the *most effective* mitigation.

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\Exception\RequestException;

$allowed_domains = ['example.com', 'cdn.example.com', 'images.example.net'];
$client = new Client();
$imageUrl = $_GET['url'];

$parsedUrl = parse_url($imageUrl);

if ($parsedUrl === false || !isset($parsedUrl['host']) || !in_array($parsedUrl['host'], $allowed_domains)) {
    throw new \Exception('Invalid URL'); // Or handle the error appropriately
}

try {
    $response = $client->request('GET', $imageUrl);
    // ...
} catch (RequestException $e) {
    // Handle request exceptions (e.g., connection errors, timeouts)
    // Log the error, but don't expose sensitive details to the user.
    error_log('Guzzle request failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
    // Optionally, return a generic error response to the user.
}
```

**2. Input Validation and Sanitization**

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;

$client = new Client();
$imageUrl = $_GET['url'];

// Validate that the URL is a valid URL and starts with http(s)
if (!filter_var($imageUrl, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) || !preg_match('/^https?:\/\//', $imageUrl)) {
    throw new \Exception('Invalid URL format');
}

// Further validation (e.g., check for allowed schemes, paths, etc.)
// ...

$response = $client->request('GET', $imageUrl);
// ...
```

**3. Disable Redirections (if possible)**

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;

$client = new Client(['allow_redirects' => false]);
$imageUrl = $_GET['url'];
$response = $client->request('GET', $imageUrl);
// ...
```

**4. Validate Redirect URLs (if redirects are necessary)**

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\RedirectMiddleware;

$allowed_domains = ['example.com', 'cdn.example.com'];

$client = new Client([
    'allow_redirects' => [
        'max'             => 5,        // Limit the number of redirects
        'strict'          => true,     // Use strict redirects
        'referer'         => true,     // Add a Referer header
        'protocols'       => ['https'], // Only allow HTTPS redirects
        'on_redirect' => function (
            \Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface $request,
            \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response,
            \Psr\Http\Message\UriInterface $uri
        ) use ($allowed_domains) {
            if (!in_array($uri->getHost(), $allowed_domains)) {
                throw new \Exception('Redirect to disallowed domain: ' . $uri->getHost());
            }
        },
    ]
]);

$imageUrl = $_GET['url'];
$response = $client->request('GET', $imageUrl);
// ...
```

**5. Network Segmentation**

This is a *defense-in-depth* measure.  Configure your network infrastructure (firewalls, VPCs, etc.) to restrict the application's ability to access internal resources.  Even if an SSRF vulnerability exists, the impact will be limited.

**6. Avoid using user input for host**
```php
use GuzzleHttp\Client;

$client = new Client();
// Hardcoded host
$response = $client->request('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data');
```

### 2.5. Testing Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities in your code.  Look for instances where user input is used to construct URLs without proper validation.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use a web application security scanner (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test for SSRF vulnerabilities.  These tools can automatically fuzz your application with various payloads to try to trigger SSRF.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Have a security expert manually test your application for SSRF vulnerabilities.  This is the most thorough approach, as it can identify subtle vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to verify that your URL validation and allow-list logic works correctly.  Test with both valid and invalid URLs, including URLs that attempt to access internal resources.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Write integration tests to verify that your application correctly handles redirects, including redirects to invalid URLs.

## 3. Conclusion

SSRF is a critical vulnerability when using libraries like Guzzle, which inherently trust the provided URL.  The primary mitigation is a strict allow-list of permitted domains.  Input validation, disabling redirects (when possible), and validating redirect URLs are also important.  Network segmentation provides an additional layer of defense.  Thorough testing, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, manual penetration testing, and unit/integration tests, is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations. By combining these strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SSRF attacks when using Guzzle.
