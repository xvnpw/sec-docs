# Attack Surface Analysis for guzzle/guzzle

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized Input in URI Construction](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_input_in_uri_construction.md)

*   **Description:**  User-provided data is directly incorporated into the URI (path, query parameters, fragment) without proper sanitization or validation.
    *   **How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle allows developers to programmatically construct URIs using variables and user input. If these inputs are not sanitized before being used in Guzzle's URI creation methods (e.g., when building a `UriInterface` object or directly in the `Client::request()` method), it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a user-provided filename and directly appends it to a base URL:
        ```php
        $filename = $_GET['file'];
        $client->get("https://example.com/files/" . $filename);
        ```
        A malicious user could provide `../../../../etc/passwd` as the filename, potentially leading to path traversal on the remote server.
    *   **Impact:**  Path traversal on the remote server, information disclosure, potential command injection depending on the remote application's handling of the URI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate user-provided input against an allowlist of expected values or patterns before using it in URI construction.
        *   **Encoding:**  Use appropriate URI encoding functions (e.g., `rawurlencode()` in PHP) to ensure special characters are properly escaped.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** When possible, use parameterized queries or similar mechanisms if the target API supports them, to avoid direct string concatenation in the URI.
        *   **Avoid Direct Concatenation:**  Use Guzzle's URI manipulation methods (e.g., `withPath()`, `withQueryValue()`) to build URIs in a safer way.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** User-controlled data is used to set HTTP headers in Guzzle requests without proper sanitization.
    *   **How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle's request options allow developers to set arbitrary headers. If user input is directly used as header values without sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom user-agent:
        ```php
        $userAgent = $_GET['user_agent'];
        $client->get('https://example.com', ['headers' => ['User-Agent' => $userAgent . "\r\nX-Custom-Header: malicious"]]);
        ```
        A malicious user could inject a newline character (`\r\n`) followed by another header, potentially leading to various attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) if `Content-Type` is manipulated, cache poisoning, session fixation if `Set-Cookie` is injected, bypassing security measures on the target server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Header Value Validation:**  Strictly validate user-provided input intended for header values against an allowlist of acceptable characters or patterns.
        *   **Avoid Direct User Input in Headers:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user input as header values. If necessary, use predefined header values based on user choices.
        *   **Sanitization:**  Sanitize user input by removing or escaping newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) and other potentially harmful characters before setting headers.

## Attack Surface: [Injection in Request Body Data](./attack_surfaces/injection_in_request_body_data.md)

*   **Description:** User input is directly included in the request body (e.g., JSON, XML, form data) without proper encoding or sanitization.
    *   **How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle provides options to send various types of request bodies. If user input is directly embedded into these bodies without proper encoding or escaping, it can lead to vulnerabilities on the target server.
    *   **Example:** An application sends user-provided data as JSON:
        ```php
        $name = $_POST['name'];
        $client->post('https://api.example.com/users', [
            'json' => ['name' => $name . '" , "isAdmin": true ']
        ]);
        ```
        A malicious user could inject additional JSON key-value pairs, potentially escalating privileges on the remote server.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on how the target server processes the data. Could lead to data manipulation, privilege escalation, or other application-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Context-Aware Encoding:**  Encode user input according to the format of the request body (e.g., JSON encode for JSON bodies, URL encode for form data).
        *   **Use Guzzle's Built-in Options:** Utilize Guzzle's options like `'json'` or `'form_params'` which handle encoding automatically, rather than manually constructing the request body string.
        *   **Server-Side Validation:**  Always validate and sanitize data on the server-side as well, as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure cURL Options](./attack_surfaces/insecure_curl_options.md)

*   **Description:**  Developers improperly configure underlying cURL options through Guzzle, weakening security.
    *   **How Guzzle Contributes:** Guzzle allows setting various cURL options via the `'curl'` request option. Misconfiguring these options can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Disabling SSL verification:
        ```php
        $client->get('https://example.com', ['curl' => [CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => false]]);
        ```
        This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, exposure of sensitive data, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Modifying Default cURL Options:**  Unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of the implications, avoid modifying default cURL options.
        *   **Enable SSL Verification:** Ensure SSL verification is enabled (`'verify' => true` or by not explicitly setting `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` to `false`).
        *   **Use Trusted CA Certificates:** If using custom CA certificates, ensure they are from a trusted source and properly configured.
        *   **Consult Security Best Practices:**  Refer to security best practices for configuring cURL options.
