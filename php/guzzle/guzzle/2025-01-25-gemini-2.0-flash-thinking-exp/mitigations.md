# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for guzzle/guzzle

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Guzzle and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_guzzle_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Composer:** Ensure your project uses Composer, the PHP dependency manager, to manage Guzzle and its dependencies.
    2.  **Run `composer update guzzlehttp/guzzle` Regularly:** Periodically execute the command `composer update guzzlehttp/guzzle` to update Guzzle to the latest stable version.
    3.  **Review `composer.lock` Changes:** After updating, carefully review the changes in your `composer.lock` file to understand which dependencies were updated alongside Guzzle.
    4.  **Test Application Functionality:** Thoroughly test your application, especially features that rely on Guzzle, after each update to ensure compatibility and no regressions were introduced.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Guzzle Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated Guzzle versions may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Updating Guzzle patches these vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Guzzle Vulnerabilities: High Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by patching known security flaws within the Guzzle library itself.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Yes, using Composer and documented update process.** We use Composer for dependency management and have a documented process for developers to update dependencies, including Guzzle, regularly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Guzzle Vulnerability Scanning:** We are not currently using automated tools specifically to scan for known vulnerabilities in the Guzzle version we are using *before* we manually update. This could be integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Guzzle Request Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_guzzle_request_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Guzzle Request Construction Points:** Locate all code sections where Guzzle requests are constructed (e.g., using `GuzzleHttp\Client::request`, `GuzzleHttp\Client::get`, `GuzzleHttp\Client::post`, etc.).
    2.  **Validate Inputs Before Guzzle Options:** Before passing user-provided or external data into Guzzle request options (like `uri`, `headers`, `query`, `body`), implement strict validation and sanitization.
    3.  **Focus on URL, Headers, and Body:** Pay special attention to validating and sanitizing data used to construct the request URL, HTTP headers, and request body, as these are common injection points.
    4.  **Use Validation Libraries:** Utilize input validation libraries or built-in PHP functions to enforce data type, format, and allowed value constraints on inputs before they reach Guzzle.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **URL Injection via Guzzle (High Severity):** Maliciously crafted URLs passed to Guzzle can lead to requests to unintended destinations.
    *   **Header Injection via Guzzle (Medium Severity):** Untrusted input in headers can manipulate HTTP headers in Guzzle requests, potentially leading to vulnerabilities on the receiving server.
    *   **Body Injection via Guzzle (Medium to High Severity):**  Unvalidated data in request bodies sent via Guzzle can lead to server-side vulnerabilities if the backend application is not properly handling the data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **URL Injection via Guzzle: High Impact:** Prevents URL injection attacks by ensuring URLs used in Guzzle requests are constructed from validated and safe components.
    *   **Header Injection via Guzzle: Medium Impact:** Reduces the risk of header injection by sanitizing header values before they are used in Guzzle requests.
    *   **Body Injection via Guzzle: Medium to High Impact:** Reduces the risk of body injection by validating data before it's sent in Guzzle request bodies.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented in specific API modules using Guzzle.** Input validation exists for some API calls using Guzzle, but it's not consistently applied across all Guzzle usage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent Validation Across All Guzzle Requests:**  Input validation and sanitization need to be consistently implemented for all Guzzle request parameters throughout the application.
    *   **Guzzle-Specific Validation Helpers:**  Consider creating helper functions or classes specifically designed to validate inputs intended for Guzzle request options to ensure consistent and secure usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Secure TLS/SSL Configuration in Guzzle](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_secure_tlsssl_configuration_in_guzzle.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `verify` Option to `true`:**  Always explicitly set the `verify` option to `true` in your Guzzle request options to enable certificate verification.  Avoid setting it to `false` in production.
    2.  **Specify Minimum TLS Version via `curl` Option:**  Use the `curl` request option within Guzzle to enforce a minimum TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher). Example: `['curl' => [CURLOPT_SSLVERSION => CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_2]]`.
    3.  **Consider Custom CA Bundle (if needed):** If you need to trust specific internal Certificate Authorities, provide a path to a custom CA bundle using the `verify` option instead of relying solely on system defaults.
    4.  **Review Guzzle Documentation on TLS/SSL:** Regularly consult the official Guzzle documentation for the latest recommendations and best practices regarding TLS/SSL configuration.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Guzzle Requests (High Severity):** Weak TLS/SSL configurations or disabled certificate verification in Guzzle can allow attackers to intercept and decrypt communication.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Guzzle Requests: High Impact:** Strong TLS/SSL configuration in Guzzle and certificate verification are crucial for preventing MitM attacks on outgoing requests.
    *   **Downgrade Attacks on Guzzle Connections: Medium Impact:** Enforcing a minimum TLS version in Guzzle mitigates downgrade attacks by preventing the use of vulnerable protocols.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **`verify` option is generally set to `true` in base Guzzle client.** We have a base Guzzle client configuration where `verify` is set to `true`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Enforce Minimum TLS Version Consistently in Guzzle:** We need to ensure the minimum TLS version is consistently enforced for *all* Guzzle requests using the `curl` option. This should be part of the default Guzzle client configuration.
    *   **Regular Review of Guzzle TLS Configuration:** Periodically review our Guzzle TLS/SSL configuration against best practices and Guzzle documentation updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Request Timeouts in Guzzle](./mitigation_strategies/implement_request_timeouts_in_guzzle.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set `connect_timeout` Guzzle Option:** Configure the `connect_timeout` option in Guzzle request options to limit the connection establishment time. Example: `['connect_timeout' => 5]`.
    2.  **Set `timeout` Guzzle Option:** Configure the `timeout` option in Guzzle request options to limit the total request time (including connection, sending, and receiving). Example: `['timeout' => 10]`.
    3.  **Choose Appropriate Timeout Values:** Select timeout values for `connect_timeout` and `timeout` that are appropriate for the expected response times of the external services you are interacting with via Guzzle and your application's tolerance for delays.
    4.  **Handle Guzzle Timeout Exceptions:** Implement `try-catch` blocks to handle `GuzzleHttp\Exception\ConnectException` and `GuzzleHttp\Exception\RequestException` (specifically timeout errors) that Guzzle may throw when timeouts are exceeded.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Slow or Unresponsive External Services (Medium to High Severity):** Without timeouts, Guzzle requests to slow or unresponsive services can hang indefinitely, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Hanging Guzzle Requests (Medium Severity):** Hanging Guzzle requests can consume application resources (threads, memory) and lead to resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Slow Services: Medium to High Impact:** Guzzle request timeouts prevent your application from being easily DoSed by slow external services.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion: Medium Impact:** Guzzle timeouts prevent resource exhaustion by limiting the duration of requests and ensuring resources are released.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented - Timeouts set for some Guzzle API calls.** Timeouts are configured for some critical API requests made with Guzzle, but not consistently across all Guzzle usage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent Timeout Configuration for All Guzzle Requests:** Timeouts should be consistently configured for *all* Guzzle requests throughout the application.
    *   **Default Guzzle Timeout Configuration:** Establish default timeout values for `connect_timeout` and `timeout` in a base Guzzle client configuration to ensure timeouts are applied by default.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Redirect Behavior in Guzzle](./mitigation_strategies/control_redirect_behavior_in_guzzle.md)

    1.  **Use `allow_redirects` Guzzle Option:** Utilize the `allow_redirects` option in Guzzle request options to control redirect behavior.
    2.  **Limit Redirect Count with `max`:**  Restrict the maximum number of redirects Guzzle will follow using the `max` parameter within `allow_redirects`. Example: `['allow_redirects' => ['max' => 5]]`.
    3.  **Disable Redirects if Not Needed:** If redirects are not required for a specific Guzzle request, explicitly disable them by setting `allow_redirects` to `false`.
    4.  **Review Redirect Handling Logic:** If you are implementing custom redirect handling with Guzzle middleware or events, carefully review the logic for security vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Excessive Redirects Leading to DoS (Medium Severity):** Attackers could potentially use excessive redirects to cause Guzzle to make numerous requests, leading to resource exhaustion or DoS.
    *   **Open Redirect Vulnerabilities (Low to Medium Severity):** If your application processes or displays redirect URLs obtained via Guzzle, uncontrolled redirects could contribute to open redirect vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Excessive Redirects (DoS): Medium Impact:** Limiting redirect count in Guzzle prevents excessive redirects from being used for DoS attacks.
    *   **Open Redirect: Low to Medium Impact:** Controlling redirect behavior in Guzzle and validating redirect URLs reduces the risk of open redirect vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Default Guzzle Redirect Behavior.** We are currently relying on Guzzle's default redirect behavior, which follows redirects without explicit limits.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Global Redirect Limit in Guzzle Configuration:** Implement a global limit on the number of redirects Guzzle will follow for all requests by default.
    *   **Review Redirect Usage:** Review all places where Guzzle is used and determine if redirects are truly necessary. Disable redirects where they are not needed.
