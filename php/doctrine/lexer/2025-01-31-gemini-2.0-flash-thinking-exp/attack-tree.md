## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Doctrine Lexer [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_doctrine_lexer__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. The attacker aims to use vulnerabilities in Doctrine Lexer to compromise the application.
    * **How it Works:** By exploiting weaknesses in the lexer itself or in how the application uses the lexer's output, the attacker seeks to achieve unauthorized actions within the application.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Successful compromise can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and full application takeover, depending on the specific vulnerability and application context.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Lexer Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__exploit_lexer_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Directly targeting vulnerabilities within the Doctrine Lexer library.
    * **How it Works:** Attackers attempt to find and exploit bugs in the lexer's parsing logic, state management, or resource handling. This can be achieved through input injection, fuzzing, or code analysis.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Exploiting a lexer vulnerability can directly lead to code execution (though less likely in PHP), denial of service, or the generation of malicious tokens that can be further exploited by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Input Injection Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__input_injection_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious input that is processed by the Doctrine Lexer to cause unintended behavior.
    * **How it Works:** Attackers inject specially crafted input strings designed to exploit weaknesses in the lexer's parsing rules or input handling. This can lead to malicious token generation, state manipulation, or denial of service.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Input injection is a common and effective attack vector against parsers and lexers. It can be relatively easy to attempt and can have a wide range of impacts, from DoS to application logic bypass.

    * **3.1. Malicious Token Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Forcing the lexer to generate tokens that are not intended or are maliciously crafted to manipulate application logic.
        * **How it Works:** By exploiting parsing logic flaws or bypassing input sanitization, attackers inject input that results in the lexer producing tokens that the application misinterprets or processes in a harmful way.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Malicious tokens can be used to bypass authentication, authorization, manipulate data, or trigger unintended application behavior if the application relies on lexer output without proper validation.

        * **3.1.1. Fuzz Lexer with Edge Cases and Invalid Input [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Using automated fuzzing tools to send a wide range of inputs to the lexer to identify parsing errors or unexpected token generation.
            * **How it Works:** Fuzzing tools automatically generate and send numerous inputs, including edge cases, invalid syntax, and long strings, to the lexer. This helps uncover vulnerabilities by observing crashes, errors, or unexpected outputs.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Fuzzing is an effective method for discovering input-related vulnerabilities in parsers and lexers, including those that could lead to malicious token injection or DoS.

        * **3.1.2. Inject Input that Bypasses Sanitization/Validation (if any) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Circumventing application-level input sanitization or validation to inject malicious input into the lexer.
            * **How it Works:** Attackers analyze the application's input validation logic and identify weaknesses or bypasses. They then craft input that passes the validation but is still malicious when processed by the lexer.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Bypassing security controls is always a high-risk scenario. Successful bypass allows attackers to inject malicious input that would otherwise be blocked, leading to various vulnerabilities.

        * **3.1.3. Application Misinterprets Malicious Tokens [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's logic that arise from misinterpreting or mishandling malicious tokens generated by the lexer.
            * **How it Works:** Even if the lexer itself is not directly vulnerable, if the application blindly trusts the tokens generated by the lexer without further validation or proper handling, it can be tricked into performing unintended actions based on malicious tokens.
            * **Why High-Risk:** This highlights vulnerabilities in application logic, which can be harder to detect and mitigate than direct lexer vulnerabilities. It can lead to business logic bypass, data manipulation, and other application-specific compromises.

            * **3.1.3.1. Application Logic Relies on Lexer Output without Validation [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * **Attack Vector:** Direct reliance on lexer output without any further validation or sanitization in the application code.
                * **How it Works:** The application directly uses the tokens generated by the lexer in its business logic, database queries, or other operations without checking for validity or malicious content.
                * **Why High-Risk:** This is a common coding mistake that directly exposes the application to vulnerabilities if the lexer can be manipulated to produce malicious tokens.

            * **3.1.3.2. Application Fails to Handle Unexpected Token Types/Values [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * **Attack Vector:** The application's logic is not designed to handle unexpected or malicious token types or values that might be generated by a vulnerable lexer.
                * **How it Works:** The application code assumes a limited set of token types and values from the lexer. If the lexer is exploited to produce unexpected tokens, the application's error handling or logic might fail, leading to vulnerabilities.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Inadequate error handling and assumptions about lexer output can create vulnerabilities when unexpected input or lexer behavior occurs.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Denial of Service (DoS) via Input [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__denial_of_service__dos__via_input__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Crafting input that causes the Doctrine Lexer to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) or crash, leading to a denial of service.
    * **How it Works:** Attackers send specially crafted input strings that exploit algorithmic inefficiencies, resource leaks, or error handling flaws in the lexer, causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    * **Why High-Risk:** DoS attacks can disrupt application availability, impacting users and business operations. While often not leading to data breaches, they can still cause significant damage and downtime.

    * **4.1. Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Overwhelming the lexer's resources (CPU or memory) with specially crafted input.
        * **How it Works:** Attackers send input designed to trigger computationally expensive parsing paths or excessive memory allocation within the lexer, leading to resource exhaustion and slow performance or crashes.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Resource exhaustion DoS can be relatively easy to execute and can quickly render an application unavailable.

        * **4.1.1. Craft Input for Excessive CPU Consumption [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Input designed to make the lexer perform a large number of computations, consuming excessive CPU time.
            * **How it Works:** Attackers identify complex parsing paths or inefficient algorithms in the lexer and craft input that triggers these, leading to high CPU utilization and slow processing.
            * **Why High-Risk:** High CPU consumption can slow down or halt the application, causing DoS.

            * **4.1.1.1. Inject Highly Nested or Recursive Input Structures [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * **Attack Vector:** Using deeply nested or recursive input structures to exploit potential inefficiencies in the lexer's parsing of such structures.
                * **How it Works:**  Input with excessive nesting or recursion can force the lexer to perform many recursive calls or iterations, leading to high CPU usage and potential stack overflow in some cases (less likely in PHP).
                * **Why High-Risk:** Nested structures are a common technique for CPU exhaustion DoS against parsers.

        * **4.1.2. Memory Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Input designed to force the lexer to allocate excessive memory, leading to memory exhaustion and application crashes.
            * **How it Works:** Attackers send input, such as extremely long strings or inputs that cause the lexer to create many objects, leading to high memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Memory exhaustion can quickly crash an application and cause DoS.

            * **4.1.2.1. Inject Extremely Long Input Strings [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * **Attack Vector:** Sending very long input strings to the lexer to consume excessive memory.
                * **How it Works:** Processing extremely long strings can force the lexer to allocate large buffers or data structures, leading to memory exhaustion.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Long strings are a simple and effective way to attempt memory exhaustion DoS.

    * **4.2. Crash or Error State DoS [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Input designed to trigger unhandled exceptions, errors, or crash states in the lexer.
        * **How it Works:** Attackers send invalid or unexpected input sequences that expose weaknesses in the lexer's error handling or cause it to enter an unrecoverable state, leading to crashes or application errors.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Application crashes directly lead to DoS and can also potentially reveal information about the application's internal workings through error messages.

        * **4.2.1. Trigger Unhandled Exceptions or Errors [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Input that causes the lexer to throw unhandled exceptions or generate fatal errors.
            * **How it Works:** Attackers send input that violates the lexer's syntax rules or triggers unexpected conditions, leading to exceptions or errors that are not properly caught and handled by the lexer or the application.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Unhandled exceptions and errors can crash the application or put it into an unstable state, causing DoS.

            * **4.2.1.1. Inject Invalid Input Sequences [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * **Attack Vector:** Sending input that contains syntax errors, unexpected characters, or violates the expected input format for the lexer.
                * **How it Works:** Invalid input can trigger error conditions in the lexer's parsing logic, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions or crashes if error handling is weak.
                * **Why High-Risk:** Invalid input is a straightforward way to test error handling and potentially trigger crash DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CRITICAL NODE] Application Uses Lexer Output in a Vulnerable Way [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node__application_uses_lexer_output_in_a_vulnerable_way__critical_node___high-risk_path_76c4db70.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that arise from how the application processes and uses the output (tokens) generated by the Doctrine Lexer.
    * **How it Works:** Even if the lexer itself is secure, vulnerabilities can occur if the application handles the lexer's output insecurely. This includes scenarios like SQL injection, command injection (less likely with Doctrine Lexer's typical use), and business logic bypass.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This category highlights that security is not just about the lexer itself but also about how it's integrated into the application. Vulnerable application-side handling of lexer output can lead to critical security flaws.

    * **5.1. [CRITICAL NODE] SQL Injection via Lexer Output (If Lexer Parses SQL-like Languages) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities that arise when the application constructs SQL queries using tokens from the lexer without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.
        * **How it Works:** If the Doctrine Lexer is used to parse a language that resembles SQL or if the application incorrectly uses lexer output to build SQL queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code through crafted input. The lexer might tokenize this malicious SQL, and if the application then uses these tokens to build queries without proper escaping or parameterized queries, SQL injection occurs.
        * **Why High-Risk:** SQL injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and full database compromise.

        * **5.1.1. [CRITICAL NODE] Application Constructs SQL Queries Directly from Lexer Tokens [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * **Attack Vector:** Directly building SQL queries by concatenating or embedding tokens from the lexer into SQL strings without using parameterized queries or proper escaping.
            * **How it Works:** The application takes tokens generated by the lexer and directly inserts them into SQL query strings. If malicious input is tokenized and used in this way, it can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Direct SQL query construction from user-controlled input (even indirectly via lexer tokens) is a classic and highly dangerous pattern that directly leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [CRITICAL NODE] Business Logic Bypass via Malicious Tokens [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6___critical_node__business_logic_bypass_via_malicious_tokens__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Using malicious tokens generated by exploiting lexer vulnerabilities to bypass or manipulate the application's business logic.
    * **How it Works:** Attackers craft input that, when processed by the lexer, results in tokens that unintentionally alter the application's flow, bypass authentication or authorization checks, or manipulate business rules.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Business logic bypass can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data manipulation within the application's scope, and other unintended consequences that can compromise the application's integrity and security.

    * **6.1. Application Logic Depends on Specific Token Sequences [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the application's reliance on specific sequences of tokens for its business logic.
        * **How it Works:** The application's code might be designed to react to certain token sequences in a specific way. If attackers can craft input that, through lexer manipulation, generates these sequences in unintended contexts, they can bypass or alter the intended business logic.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Business logic vulnerabilities are often subtle and harder to detect than technical vulnerabilities like injection flaws. They can lead to significant security and functional issues.

    * **6.2. Malicious Tokens Alter Application Flow Unintentionally [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Attack Vector:** Unintentionally changing the application's execution path or behavior through the injection of malicious tokens.
        * **How it Works:** Crafted malicious tokens, even if not directly intended for injection attacks, can have side effects on the application's control flow or data processing, leading to unintended and potentially harmful outcomes.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Unintentional logic flaws triggered by malicious input can be difficult to predict and debug, and can lead to unexpected security vulnerabilities.
