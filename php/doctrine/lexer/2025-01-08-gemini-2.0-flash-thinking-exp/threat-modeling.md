# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/lexer

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Input Bomb](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_input_bomb.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts an extremely long or deeply nested input string that, when processed by the lexer, consumes excessive CPU and memory resources. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential server overload.

**Affected Component:** Core Lexer (specifically the tokenization process and internal buffer management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input size limits on strings passed to the lexer.
* Set timeouts for lexer operations to prevent indefinite processing.
* Consider using a streaming or iterative approach for lexing very large inputs if the lexer supports it or if a custom solution is feasible.
* Implement resource monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

**Description:** If the Doctrine Lexer internally utilizes regular expressions for token matching, an attacker can provide input that exploits the backtracking behavior of these regexes. This can cause the regex engine to enter a state of exponential processing time, leading to a DoS.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, increased resource consumption, potential service disruption or crash.

**Affected Component:** Tokenizer (specifically the regular expressions used for token matching).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review the Doctrine Lexer's source code or documentation to identify potentially vulnerable regular expressions.
* If using a custom lexer based on Doctrine Lexer, avoid using complex or nested regex patterns that are known to be susceptible to ReDoS.
* Consider using alternative, more efficient tokenization methods that do not rely on potentially vulnerable regex patterns.
* Implement timeouts for regex matching operations if configurable.

## Threat: [Tokenization Vulnerabilities Leading to Indirect Injection](./threats/tokenization_vulnerabilities_leading_to_indirect_injection.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on the lexer to tokenize input that is subsequently used in a sensitive context (e.g., generating code, queries, or commands), flaws in the lexer's tokenization logic could allow an attacker to craft input that results in unexpected or malicious tokens. These malicious tokens could then be interpreted by downstream components, leading to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., if tokens are used to build SQL queries without proper sanitization).

**Impact:** Potential for various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) in downstream components.

**Affected Component:** Tokenizer (specifically the rules and logic for identifying and categorizing tokens).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all tokens generated by the lexer before using them in sensitive operations.
* Employ parameterized queries or prepared statements when using lexer output in database interactions.
* Use output encoding when displaying lexer output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), even if the lexer itself doesn't directly introduce it.
* Implement strict input validation based on the expected grammar or syntax before passing data to the lexer.
