## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Lexer Parsing Logic -> Trigger Unexpected Behavior due to Invalid Input:](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_lexer_parsing_logic_-_trigger_unexpected_behavior_due_to_invalid_input.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts input strings that intentionally violate the expected syntax of the lexer, include unusual boundary conditions, or use problematic Unicode characters or encoding.
* **Impact:** This can lead to parsing errors, unexpected tokenization, or incorrect state transitions within the lexer. While the immediate impact might be low, it can disrupt the application's normal processing flow and potentially be a stepping stone for more severe attacks by causing the application to behave in unpredictable ways.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: Medium to High (under Force Incorrect Token Classification):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_medium_to_high__under_force_incorrect_token_classification_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts input specifically designed to trick the lexer into misclassifying tokens. For example, an attacker might try to make the lexer interpret a keyword as a user-supplied identifier.
* **Impact:** This can have a significant impact on the application's logic. If a keyword is misinterpreted, it could lead to security checks being bypassed, incorrect data processing, or the execution of unintended code paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: Medium to High (under Cause Token Omission or Insertion):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_medium_to_high__under_cause_token_omission_or_insertion_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts input that exploits vulnerabilities in the lexer's implementation to cause it to skip over crucial tokens or introduce spurious tokens into the output stream.
* **Impact:**  Omitting important tokens can lead to security checks being missed or critical operations not being performed. Inserting extra tokens can disrupt the expected structure of the input and cause the application to misinterpret the data.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: High (under Trigger Buffer Overflow):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_high__under_trigger_buffer_overflow_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Although less likely in PHP, an attacker might attempt to provide extremely long input strings in hopes of overflowing internal buffers within the lexer's code (or underlying C extensions if used).
* **Impact:** A successful buffer overflow can lead to crashes, denial of service, or, in more severe scenarios (though less probable in PHP's managed memory environment), the potential for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Cause Denial of Service (DoS):](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input that is specifically designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU or memory) during the lexing process. This can involve complex or deeply nested input structures that force the lexer into computationally expensive operations or extremely long input strings that lead to excessive memory allocation.
* **Impact:** A successful DoS attack makes the application unavailable to legitimate users, disrupting its functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: Medium (under Trigger Excessive CPU Usage):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_medium__under_trigger_excessive_cpu_usage_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The attacker crafts input that exploits inefficiencies in the lexer's algorithms or regular expressions, causing it to consume a large amount of CPU time.
* **Impact:** This can lead to a denial of service by slowing down or crashing the application due to CPU exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: Medium (under Trigger Excessive Memory Usage):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_medium__under_trigger_excessive_memory_usage_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker provides input that forces the lexer to allocate a large amount of memory, potentially exhausting the server's available memory.
* **Impact:** This can lead to a denial of service as the application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to memory exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Influence Application Logic via Malformed Tokens -> Bypass Security Checks:](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_influence_application_logic_via_malformed_tokens_-_bypass_security_checks.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits weaknesses in the lexer to produce malformed tokens that are then misinterpreted by the application's authentication or authorization logic.
* **Impact:** This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts or protected resources and functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: High (under Circumvent Authentication):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_high__under_circumvent_authentication_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the lexer's output, the attacker can craft input that bypasses the application's authentication mechanisms, allowing them to log in as other users or gain administrative access without proper credentials.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts and potentially the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: High (under Circumvent Authorization):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_high__under_circumvent_authorization_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the lexer's output to trick the application into granting them access to resources or functionalities that they are not authorized to access.
* **Impact:** Access to sensitive data, the ability to perform unauthorized actions, and potential further compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Influence Application Logic via Malformed Tokens -> Trigger Unintended Application Behavior:](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_influence_application_logic_via_malformed_tokens_-_trigger_unintended_application_beh_8b385e60.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits lexer weaknesses to generate malformed tokens that cause the application to behave in unintended ways during data processing or other operations.
* **Impact:** This can lead to data corruption or, in the worst case, the indirect execution of unintended code.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: High (under Cause Data Corruption):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_high__under_cause_data_corruption_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the lexer's output, the attacker can cause the application to misinterpret data, leading to incorrect data being written to the database or other storage mechanisms.
* **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, potentially leading to business disruptions or security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Impact: Critical (under Cause Execution of Unintended Code (Indirectly)):](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_impact_critical__under_cause_execution_of_unintended_code__indirectly__.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages lexer vulnerabilities to generate malformed tokens that, when processed by the application, lead to the construction and execution of unintended code or commands. This could occur through vulnerabilities in query language interpreters or templating engines used by the application.
* **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain complete control.
