# Attack Surface Analysis for doctrine/lexer

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Resource Consumption (DoS) via Long Input Strings](./attack_surfaces/excessive_resource_consumption__dos__via_long_input_strings.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an extremely long input string to the lexer, causing it to consume excessive memory or processing time.

**How Lexer Contributes:** The lexer needs to allocate memory to store and process the entire input string. A very long string can exhaust available resources.

**Example:** Sending a multi-megabyte string of arbitrary characters to an endpoint that uses the Doctrine Lexer to parse input.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, potential crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input length limits on data passed to the lexer.
* Set timeouts for lexer operations to prevent indefinite processing.

## Attack Surface: [Stack Exhaustion (DoS) via Deeply Nested Input](./attack_surfaces/stack_exhaustion__dos__via_deeply_nested_input.md)

**Description:** If the lexer is used to parse languages with nested structures (e.g., parentheses, brackets), a deeply nested input can lead to stack overflow errors due to excessive recursion.

**How Lexer Contributes:** The lexer's parsing logic might use recursion to handle nested structures. Excessive nesting can exceed the call stack limit.

**Example:** Providing an input string with thousands of nested parentheses `((((...))))` to a parser built with the Doctrine Lexer.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum depth of nesting allowed in the input.
* Consider alternative parsing strategies that are less prone to stack overflow (e.g., iterative approaches).

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Tokenization Leading to Downstream Exploits](./attack_surfaces/malicious_tokenization_leading_to_downstream_exploits.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts input that exploits weaknesses in the lexer's tokenization rules, causing it to generate incorrect or unexpected tokens. These incorrect tokens are then processed by downstream components, leading to vulnerabilities.

**How Lexer Contributes:** The lexer's primary function is tokenization. Flaws in its logic can result in misinterpretations of the input.

**Example:** In a simplified expression evaluator, crafting input that is incorrectly tokenized as a function call with malicious arguments when it should be treated as a string literal.

**Impact:** Bypass of security checks, code injection, data manipulation, privilege escalation (depending on the downstream processing).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test the lexer with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including potentially malicious ones.
* Implement robust validation and sanitization of tokens *after* they are generated by the lexer, before they are used by other parts of the application.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (If Applicable Internally)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos___if_applicable_internally_.md)

**Description:** If the lexer internally uses regular expressions for token matching, a carefully crafted input string can cause the regex engine to backtrack excessively, leading to high CPU consumption and a denial of service.

**How Lexer Contributes:** The lexer's internal implementation might rely on vulnerable regular expressions for pattern matching.

**Example:** Providing an input string that matches a vulnerable regular expression in a way that triggers exponential backtracking (e.g., `a+a+a+b` against `aaaa...`).

**Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, potential crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review the lexer's source code for potentially vulnerable regular expressions.
* Use non-backtracking regular expression engines or techniques if possible.
* Implement timeouts for regular expression matching operations.
