# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/lexer

## Threat: [Malicious Input Leading to Incorrect Tokenization](./threats/malicious_input_leading_to_incorrect_tokenization.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Input Leading to Incorrect Tokenization
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific input string that exploits ambiguities or edge cases in the lexer's grammar definition. This causes the lexer to produce incorrect tokens, which are then misinterpreted by the consuming application. The attacker might manipulate the input to bypass security checks, inject unintended commands, or alter the application's logic flow.
    * **Impact:**  The application might perform unintended actions, leading to data corruption, unauthorized access, or privilege escalation depending on how the tokens are used.
    * **Affected Component:** Core tokenization logic, specifically the functions responsible for matching and categorizing input characters into tokens (e.g., within the `Lexer` class, potentially in methods like `scan`, or specific state handling logic).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to the lexer. Define strict rules for acceptable input formats.
        * Thoroughly test the lexer with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including boundary conditions and potentially malicious patterns identified through fuzzing or security analysis.
        * Consider using a well-defined and formally verified grammar for the language being lexed to reduce ambiguity.
        * Regularly update the Doctrine Lexer library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that may address parsing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Resource Consumption](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_excessive_resource_consumption.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Resource Consumption
    * **Description:** An attacker provides an input string that triggers inefficient parsing behavior within the lexer. This could involve extremely long input strings, deeply nested structures (if the grammar supports them), or patterns that cause the lexer to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive CPU or memory.
    * **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing its services.
    * **Affected Component:** Core tokenization loop/logic, potentially the input buffer handling or state management within the `Lexer` class. Regular expression engine if used internally for token matching.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement timeouts for the lexing process to prevent indefinite processing of malicious input.
        * Limit the maximum size of input strings that are passed to the lexer.
        * Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during lexing operations and implement alerts for unusual spikes.
        * Analyze the lexer's performance with various input sizes and complexities to identify potential bottlenecks.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

* **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    * **Description:** If the lexer's implementation relies on regular expressions for token matching, a poorly constructed regular expression can be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. A specially crafted input can cause the regex engine to backtrack excessively, leading to exponential processing time and resource exhaustion.
    * **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive CPU consumption by the regex engine.
    * **Affected Component:** Regular expression engine used internally by the lexer (if applicable), specifically the regular expressions defined for token matching within the `Lexer` class or related components.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review and test all regular expressions used within the lexer's implementation for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
        * Avoid using complex or nested quantifiers (e.g., `(a+)+`, `(a+)*`) in regular expressions where possible.
        * Consider using alternative, more efficient tokenization methods if ReDoS vulnerabilities are a significant concern.
        * Employ static analysis tools to identify potential ReDoS vulnerabilities in regular expressions.
