## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Logic Based on Lexer Output](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_based_on_lexer_output.md)

**Inject Malicious Tokens [CRITICAL]**
*   Description: By exploiting input handling or rule definition vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject tokens that, when processed by the application, lead to unintended actions (e.g., SQL injection if tokens are used to build queries).
*   Actionable Insight: Treat the output of the lexer as untrusted data. Implement proper validation and sanitization of tokens before using them in application logic. Follow the principle of least privilege when using tokens.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Medium
*   Skill Level: Medium
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Lexer](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_lexer.md)

**Resource Exhaustion**
*   Description: Provide input that causes the lexer to consume excessive resources, leading to application slowdown or crash.
*   Actionable Insight: Implement timeouts and resource limits for lexer operations. Monitor CPU and memory usage and implement alerts for unusual activity.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Low to Medium
*   Skill Level: Low to Medium
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **CPU Exhaustion [CRITICAL]**
        *   Description: Provide input that causes the lexer to perform computationally intensive operations, leading to CPU exhaustion and application slowdown or crash.
        *   Actionable Insight: Implement timeouts and resource limits for lexer operations. Monitor CPU usage and identify potentially problematic input patterns.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Low to Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **Memory Exhaustion [CRITICAL]**
        *   Description: Provide input that causes the lexer to allocate excessive memory, leading to memory exhaustion and application crash.
        *   Actionable Insight: Implement limits on the size and complexity of input processed by the lexer. Monitor memory usage during lexer operations.
        *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   **Infinite Loops or Recursion [CRITICAL]**
    *   Description: Craft input that triggers infinite loops or excessive recursion within the lexer's parsing logic, leading to application hang or crash.
    *   Actionable Insight: Carefully review the lexer's parsing logic for potential infinite loops or recursion vulnerabilities. Implement safeguards against such scenarios.
    *   Likelihood: Low
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium to High
    *   Skill Level: High
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Regular Expressions (If Applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_regular_expressions__if_applicable_.md)

*   Description: If the lexer uses regular expressions for token matching, poorly written regex can be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.
*   Actionable Insight: Carefully review and test all regular expressions used in the lexer for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities. Use efficient and secure regex patterns. (Note: Doctrine Lexer's regex usage is generally simpler, but this is a general concern for lexers).
*   Likelihood: Low
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Medium to High
*   Skill Level: Medium to High
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium
