# Attack Surface Analysis for doctrine/lexer

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Input Complexity](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_input_complexity.md)

**Description:** Providing the lexer with extremely long or deeply nested input strings can consume excessive CPU and memory resources *within the lexer itself*, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**How Lexer Contributes:** The core function of the lexer is to process and tokenize the input. Inherently complex input directly translates to increased processing demands *on the lexer*.

**Example:** A very long string with deeply nested parentheses or brackets in a language the lexer is designed to parse, causing the lexer to become unresponsive.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to the lexer's resource exhaustion, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement input size limits on the data passed *directly* to the lexer.
*   Set timeouts for *lexer processing* to prevent indefinite resource consumption within the lexer.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

**Description:** If the lexer internally uses poorly constructed regular expressions for token matching, a specially crafted input string can cause the regex engine *within the lexer* to backtrack excessively, leading to exponential processing time and resource exhaustion.

**How Lexer Contributes:** The lexer's tokenization process relies on regular expressions. Vulnerable regex patterns *within the lexer's code* are the direct cause of this issue.

**Example:** An input string designed to exploit a vulnerable regex pattern *within the lexer*, causing it to take an extremely long time to process (e.g., `aaaa...b` against a regex like `(a+)+b` used internally by the lexer).

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive CPU usage *by the lexer*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Carefully review the *lexer's source code* or documentation for the regular expressions used.
*   Test the lexer with various input patterns, including those known to cause ReDoS in similar regex engines.
*   If possible, configure or replace vulnerable regular expressions *within the lexer's implementation* with more efficient alternatives (this might require forking or patching the library).
*   Implement timeouts for lexer processing.

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/indirect_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** While the lexer itself doesn't execute code, if the tokens it produces are used in a subsequent stage without proper sanitization or validation, it can contribute to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection). *The lexer's role is in the initial parsing and tokenization of potentially malicious input.*

**How Lexer Contributes:** The lexer provides the initial breakdown of the input. If it doesn't properly handle or flag potentially malicious input components *during the tokenization process*, these can be passed on to vulnerable downstream processes.

**Example:** A lexer used to parse a query language that doesn't properly tokenize or escape special characters. The resulting tokens are then used to construct a database query without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection. *The lexer's failure to correctly tokenize or flag the malicious parts of the query contributes to the vulnerability.*

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Treat the output of the lexer as untrusted data.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the tokens produced by the lexer before using them in any sensitive operations.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing database queries.
*   Avoid directly constructing commands or code based on lexer output without proper escaping and validation. *This includes ensuring the lexer itself doesn't produce tokens that make such construction inherently unsafe.*
