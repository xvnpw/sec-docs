# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a stable and reliable lexer library for PHP projects.
*   Ensure the library is easy to use and integrate into existing projects.
*   Maintain high performance and efficiency for tokenizing code.
*   Support a wide range of PHP versions.
*   Foster a community-driven development model through GitHub.

Business Risks:

*   Vulnerabilities in the lexer could lead to incorrect parsing of code, potentially causing application errors or security exploits in projects that use it.
*   Performance bottlenecks in the lexer could impact the performance of applications that rely on it.
*   Lack of compatibility with newer PHP versions could limit the library's adoption and usefulness.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could hinder developer adoption and usage.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews are performed as part of the pull request process on GitHub (implied by the open-source nature and contribution guidelines).
*   security control: Static analysis is likely used, although the specific tools are not mentioned in the repository's root (implied by the nature of the project and common practices).
*   security control: Unit tests are present, covering various aspects of the lexer's functionality (visible in the `tests/` directory).
*   security control: The library is relatively simple and self-contained, reducing the attack surface.
*   security control: Issue tracking on GitHub allows for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on the correctness of the PHP grammar it implements. Errors in the grammar definition could lead to misinterpretations of code.
*   accepted risk: The library's security is ultimately dependent on the security of the PHP runtime environment.
*   accepted risk: There might be unknown vulnerabilities that haven't been discovered or reported yet.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Integrate a dedicated SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tool into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm, Phan).
*   security control: Implement fuzz testing to identify potential edge cases and vulnerabilities that might not be caught by unit tests.
*   security control: Establish a clear security policy and vulnerability disclosure process.
*   security control: Regularly update dependencies to address any known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (although this project has minimal external dependencies).
*   security control: Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify and manage any dependencies and their associated vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as the library is not an authentication system.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as the library does not handle authorization.
*   Input Validation: The library's primary function is to process input (PHP code). Input validation, in this context, means correctly handling valid and invalid PHP syntax according to the language specification. The library should gracefully handle syntax errors without crashing or creating vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as the library does not perform cryptographic operations. However, if the lexer is used to process code that *contains* cryptographic operations, it should not interfere with or weaken those operations.
*   Error Handling: The library should handle errors, such as invalid input, in a predictable and secure manner. It should not expose sensitive information in error messages or logs.

    CI -- "Runs" --> Tests["Unit Tests"]

    Linter -- "Findings" --> Report
    Report -- "Reviewed by" --> Developer
    CI -- "If all checks pass" --> Artifact["Build Artifact (Composer Package)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Commit:** A developer commits code changes to the Doctrine Lexer repository on GitHub.
2.  **CI/CD Trigger:** GitHub Actions (or a similar CI/CD system) is triggered by the commit.
3.  **Unit Tests:** The CI pipeline runs the unit tests to ensure the code functions as expected.
4.  **SAST:** A Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) is executed to analyze the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
5.  **Linting:** A linter (e.g., PHP_CodeSniffer) is run to check for code style and potential errors.
6.  **Reporting:** The results of the tests, SAST, and linting are reported.
7.  **Artifact Creation:** If all checks pass, a build artifact (the Composer package) is created. This artifact is not directly deployed but is made available for use via Composer and Packagist.org.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code reviews on GitHub before merging changes.
*   security control: Unit tests to verify functionality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: SAST tool integration to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Linter to enforce code style and identify potential errors.
*   security control: Automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent and repeatable builds.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a reliable and accurate lexing service for PHP code. This is critical for any application that relies on the library for parsing or analyzing PHP code.

Data Protection:

*   The library itself does not handle sensitive data directly. It processes PHP code, which *could* contain sensitive information (e.g., hardcoded credentials, API keys – although this is bad practice). The library's primary security concern is to avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited to *access* or *manipulate* the code it processes.
*   Data Sensitivity: The sensitivity of the data handled by the library is entirely dependent on the code being processed by the applications that use it. The library itself does not define data sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., OWASP, PCI DSS) that the library needs to adhere to, even indirectly?
*   What is the expected usage context of the library? Is it primarily used in security-sensitive applications, or in a broader range of contexts?
*   What is the long-term maintenance plan for the library? How will security updates and patches be handled?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a robust and reliable lexer for the PHP community. Security is a high priority, but performance and ease of use are also important.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The development team follows secure coding practices, even if they are not explicitly documented. The library is assumed to be relatively low-risk due to its limited scope and functionality.
*   DESIGN: The library is designed to be simple and efficient. The provided C4 diagrams are a reasonable representation of the library's structure. The deployment process via Composer is the standard and most relevant method. The build process includes basic security checks, and it is assumed that GitHub Actions (or a similar CI/CD system) is used.
