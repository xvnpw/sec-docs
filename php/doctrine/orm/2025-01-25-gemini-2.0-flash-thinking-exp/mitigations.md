# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for doctrine/orm

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (Doctrine ORM Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__doctrine_orm_focus_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Doctrine's Query Builder and DQL:**  Primarily construct database queries using Doctrine's Query Builder or Doctrine Query Language (DQL). These tools are designed to facilitate parameterized queries.
    2.  **Employ `setParameter()` in Query Builder:** When using Query Builder, consistently use the `setParameter()` method to bind user inputs to query parameters. This ensures that user-provided values are treated as data, not executable SQL code.
    3.  **Use Parameters in DQL:** In DQL queries, use named parameters (e.g., `:username`) or positional parameters (e.g., `?1`) and pass the actual values as an array to the `createQuery()` or `execute()` methods.
    4.  **Avoid Native SQL for User Input:** Minimize or eliminate the use of native SQL queries (`EntityManager::getConnection()->executeQuery()`) when dealing with user input. If unavoidable, meticulously parameterize all user-provided values using the database connection's parameter binding methods.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code through Doctrine ORM queries, leading to unauthorized database access, data manipulation, or data breaches.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** High risk reduction. Parameterized queries are the most effective defense against SQL injection vulnerabilities within Doctrine ORM applications.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Largely implemented in `UserRepository` and `ProductRepository` using Query Builder with `setParameter()`. DQL queries in these repositories also utilize parameters.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Review dynamically generated DQL queries in reporting modules to ensure consistent parameterization. Audit all custom DQL queries across the application for proper parameter usage, especially when filters are applied based on user input.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Guarded Properties (Doctrine ORM Mass Assignment Protection)](./mitigation_strategies/guarded_properties__doctrine_orm_mass_assignment_protection_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage `@Column` Annotation:** Utilize the `@Column` annotation in your Doctrine entity classes to control property updatability.
        *   `updatable=false`:  Set this option for properties that should not be modified after entity creation (e.g., `id`, timestamps).
    2.  **Control Nullability with `@Column`:** Use `nullable=false` in `@Column` to enforce that certain properties are always set during entity creation, preventing unexpected states.
    3.  **Consider Entity Lifecycle Events:** For more complex control over property modifications, use Doctrine's lifecycle events (`@PrePersist`, `@PreUpdate`) to implement custom logic for guarding properties based on application state or user roles.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Mass Assignment Vulnerability (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating request parameters to modify unintended entity properties through Doctrine's mass assignment features, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data corruption.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Mass Assignment:** High risk reduction.  Effectively limits the scope of mass assignment and protects sensitive entity properties from unauthorized modification via Doctrine ORM.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `@Column(updatable=false)` is used for `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields in base entities, providing basic protection for these timestamp fields.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematically review and apply `@Column(updatable=false)` to all sensitive properties across entities, including `id`, `roles`, `permissions`, and status fields.  Explore using lifecycle events for more nuanced control over property updates based on business logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Eager Loading and Query Optimization (Doctrine ORM Performance & DoS)](./mitigation_strategies/eager_loading_and_query_optimization__doctrine_orm_performance_&_dos_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strategic Eager Loading:** Use eager loading (`fetch: EAGER` in entity relationships or `Query::HINT_FETCH_JOIN` in DQL/Query Builder) judiciously to prevent N+1 query problems. Eager load related entities only when you know they will be needed in the application logic.
    2.  **Doctrine Query and Result Caching:** Implement Doctrine's query caching and result caching mechanisms to store frequently executed queries and their results. Configure appropriate cache providers (e.g., Redis, Memcached, ArrayCache for development).
    3.  **Optimize DQL and Query Builder Queries:** Refine DQL and Query Builder queries for efficiency:
        *   Use projections to select only necessary fields, reducing data transfer.
        *   Optimize `WHERE` clauses and `JOIN` conditions for database index utilization.
    4.  **Pagination with Doctrine:** Implement pagination using `Query::setMaxResults()` and `Query::setFirstResult()` in Doctrine to limit the number of results fetched in a single query, especially for list views.
    5.  **Doctrine Query Profiling:** Utilize Doctrine's query profiler during development and testing to identify slow or inefficient queries generated by Doctrine ORM.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting inefficient Doctrine ORM queries to overload the database and application, leading to service disruption.
        *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):**  Optimized Doctrine queries ensure application responsiveness and prevent performance bottlenecks that could indirectly impact security by making the application less reliable.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS:** Medium to High risk reduction. Optimized Doctrine queries and caching reduce the application's vulnerability to DoS attacks targeting database resources.
        *   **Performance Degradation:** High risk reduction. Improves application performance and responsiveness by ensuring efficient data retrieval through Doctrine ORM.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic pagination is used in product listings. Query caching is enabled with file-based cache for development. Eager loading is used in some relationships, but not systematically optimized.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive performance profiling of Doctrine queries across the application. Implement result caching with a production-ready cache provider (Redis/Memcached).  Systematically review and optimize eager loading strategies for all entity relationships.  Refine DQL and Query Builder queries based on profiling results to ensure optimal performance.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Projections and DTOs for Data Exposure (Doctrine ORM Context)](./mitigation_strategies/projections_and_dtos_for_data_exposure__doctrine_orm_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Projections in Doctrine Queries:** When fetching data for APIs or specific use cases, use projections in your DQL or Query Builder queries to select only the necessary entity fields. This avoids fetching entire entities when only a subset of data is required.
    2.  **Map Doctrine Entities to DTOs:** Create Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to represent the data structure for API responses or data outputs. Map data from Doctrine entities (or projection results) to DTOs before outputting. DTOs should contain only the intended data and exclude sensitive or internal entity properties.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Exposure (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive or internal entity properties when data is retrieved and outputted through Doctrine ORM queries.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of information disclosure by limiting the amount of data fetched and exposed via Doctrine ORM operations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Exposure:** Medium risk reduction. Doctrine projections and DTOs effectively control the data retrieved and exposed through the ORM layer.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium risk reduction. Minimizes the risk of unintentional information leakage by limiting data retrieval via Doctrine.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   DTOs are used for some API endpoints, particularly for user data. Projections are used in a few specific queries for performance optimization.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematic adoption of DTOs and projections for all API endpoints and data output contexts. Review all API responses and data outputs to ensure DTOs are consistently used and projections are applied in corresponding Doctrine queries to fetch only the required data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Doctrine ORM Configuration and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/secure_doctrine_orm_configuration_and_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Doctrine Configuration:** Regularly review your Doctrine configuration files (`doctrine.yaml`, XML mapping files) for any security-relevant settings.
    2.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Database User:** Ensure the database user configured for Doctrine ORM has only the necessary privileges required for application operations. Avoid granting excessive permissions.
    3.  **Regular Doctrine and Dependency Updates:**  Establish a process for regularly updating Doctrine ORM, database drivers, and related dependencies to the latest versions. This is crucial for patching known security vulnerabilities in the ORM library itself.
    4.  **Monitor Doctrine Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for Doctrine ORM to stay informed about potential security vulnerabilities and recommended updates.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Doctrine ORM Library (Variable Severity):** Outdated Doctrine ORM versions may contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
        *   **Unauthorized Database Access (Medium Severity):**  Overly permissive database user credentials configured for Doctrine could be exploited if application credentials are compromised.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Doctrine ORM Library:** High risk reduction. Keeping Doctrine ORM updated is essential for mitigating vulnerabilities within the ORM itself.
        *   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Medium risk reduction.  Least privilege database user configuration limits the potential damage from compromised application credentials related to Doctrine ORM.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Database credentials are managed via environment variables. Dependency updates are performed periodically, but not on a strict schedule.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Establish a strict schedule for Doctrine ORM and dependency updates. Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning. Conduct a security review of database user privileges configured for Doctrine ORM to enforce least privilege. Subscribe to Doctrine security advisories and establish a process for responding to security alerts related to Doctrine.
