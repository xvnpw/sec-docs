# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/orm

## Threat: [DQL Injection (Second-Order)](./threats/dql_injection__second-order_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is stored in the database.  Later, this seemingly benign data is used unsafely within a Doctrine Query Language (DQL) query or QueryBuilder call, leading to unintended query execution.  The attacker exploits a vulnerability in how Doctrine *constructs* queries, not just general input handling.  The key is that the vulnerability exists *within* Doctrine's DQL parsing or QueryBuilder logic, even if parameterized queries are *intended* to be used.  A hypothetical example: a bug in Doctrine's handling of a specific DQL function or operator that allows injection even with parameters.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized data access.
        *   Unauthorized data modification.
        *   Potential for complete database compromise.
    *   **ORM Component Affected:**
        *   `Doctrine\ORM\QueryBuilder`:  Vulnerabilities in how QueryBuilder methods construct SQL queries from user-influenced data, *even when parameters are used*.
        *   `Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager::createQuery()`:  Vulnerabilities in the DQL parser itself, allowing injection even with parameterized DQL.
        *   Custom repository methods that internally construct DQL queries in an unsafe manner (even if they *intend* to use parameters, a bug could exist).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries (Primary Defense):**  Doctrine's QueryBuilder and DQL are *designed* to use parameterized queries.  Ensure this is *always* the case.  This is the primary defense, but this threat focuses on *failures* of that defense.
        *   **Regular Doctrine Updates:**  This is *crucial*.  The core mitigation is to keep Doctrine ORM updated to the latest stable version to patch any discovered vulnerabilities in its DQL parsing or QueryBuilder logic.  This threat assumes a vulnerability *within* Doctrine itself.
        *   **Code Reviews (Focus on DQL):**  Thoroughly review any code that interacts with DQL or QueryBuilder, even if it appears to use parameters correctly.  Look for any unusual string manipulation or complex logic that might introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation (Secondary Defense):** While not the *primary* defense against this ORM-specific threat, validating input *before* it's stored can help prevent storing malicious data that *could* be exploited if a Doctrine vulnerability exists.

## Threat: [Unintended Field Update via `flush()` (ORM Logic Flaw)](./threats/unintended_field_update_via__flush_____orm_logic_flaw_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input that, while seemingly valid for updating a specific field, causes Doctrine's `EntityManager::flush()` method to update *other* fields unintentionally due to a flaw *within Doctrine's change tracking logic*. This is *not* about simply providing unexpected input; it's about exploiting a bug or misconfiguration in how Doctrine *determines* which fields to update.  For example, a hypothetical bug in Doctrine's `UnitOfWork` might incorrectly mark a field as "dirty" even though it hasn't been changed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data corruption.
        *   Bypassing business logic.
        *   Potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **ORM Component Affected:**
        *   `Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager::flush()`: The core method where the vulnerability manifests.
        *   `Doctrine\ORM\UnitOfWork`:  The internal component responsible for tracking changes.  A bug *here* is the likely root cause.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Doctrine Updates:**  Keep Doctrine ORM updated to the latest stable version. This is the primary mitigation, as it addresses potential bugs in the `UnitOfWork` or `flush()` logic.
        *   **Explicit Field Updates (Best Practice):**  While not a *direct* mitigation for a Doctrine bug, explicitly setting only the fields that should be changed (using setters) is a good practice that *reduces the attack surface*.  It makes it less likely that a Doctrine bug could be exploited.
        *   **Doctrine Event Listeners (preUpdate - for Detection):**  Implement a `preUpdate` event listener to *inspect* the changes being made to an entity *before* they are persisted.  This can help *detect* if unintended fields are being updated, even if the root cause is a Doctrine bug.  This is a *detection* mechanism, not a prevention mechanism for the underlying bug.
        *   **DTOs (Reduces Attack Surface):** Using DTOs, as described before, limits the data that *can* be passed to the entity, reducing the likelihood of triggering a hypothetical Doctrine bug.

## Threat: [Bypassing Entity-Level Access Control (ORM Relationship Flaw)](./threats/bypassing_entity-level_access_control__orm_relationship_flaw_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates object IDs or relationships to access or modify entities they shouldn't have access to, exploiting a flaw in how Doctrine *enforces* relationships or ownership. This is *not* about simply providing an incorrect ID; it's about exploiting a bug or misconfiguration in Doctrine's relationship management.  For example, a hypothetical bug in how Doctrine handles cascading deletes or updates might allow an attacker to bypass ownership checks. Or, a misconfigured `@JoinColumn` with incorrect `nullable` or `onDelete` settings could be exploited.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized data access.
        *   Unauthorized data modification.
        *   Violation of data integrity.
    *   **ORM Component Affected:**
        *   Relationship Mapping (Annotations):  Incorrectly configured `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@JoinColumn`, `cascade`, `orphanRemoval`, or `nullable` options.  This is where the vulnerability would likely reside.
        *   `Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager::find()`, `getReference()`:  If the logic for *finding* or *referencing* entities has a flaw that allows bypassing ownership checks.
        *   `Doctrine\ORM\PersistentCollection`: If a bug allows direct manipulation of the collection, bypassing the owning entity's access controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Doctrine Updates:**  Keep Doctrine ORM updated to address potential bugs in its relationship management logic.
        *   **Correct Relationship Definitions:**  *Thoroughly* review and ensure that all relationships between entities are correctly defined using Doctrine's annotations.  Pay *extremely* close attention to `cascade`, `orphanRemoval`, `nullable`, and `onDelete` options.  This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Doctrine Event Listeners (postLoad, prePersist, preUpdate - for Enforcement):**  Use event listeners to implement *additional* security checks, *beyond* what Doctrine's annotations provide.  `postLoad` can verify ownership after an entity is loaded.  `prePersist` and `preUpdate` can prevent unauthorized creation or modification of relationships.  These listeners act as a *second layer* of defense.
        *   **Secure Object Retrieval (Best Practice):**  As a general best practice, *never* directly use user-provided IDs to fetch entities without verifying ownership or access rights *within your application logic*. This reduces the attack surface, even if a Doctrine vulnerability exists.
