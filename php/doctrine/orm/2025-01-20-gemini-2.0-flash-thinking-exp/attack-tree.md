## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit DQL Injection Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_dql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious DQL code through user-controlled input that is used to construct DQL queries.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify Input Points Affecting DQL Queries: Locate areas where user input influences DQL.
    *   Craft Malicious DQL Payloads: Develop DQL queries for unauthorized actions.
        *   Leverage DQL Features for Exploitation:
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Data Exfiltration (CRITICAL NODE):** Extract sensitive data using injected DQL.
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Data Manipulation (Insert, Update, Delete) (CRITICAL NODE):** Modify data using injected DQL.
*   **Risk:** High likelihood due to common input points and significant to critical impact (data breach, data corruption).

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Manipulate Data Handling and Hydration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_data_handling_and_hydration.md)

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide unexpected data during entity creation or updates to modify sensitive attributes.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Identify Entities with Writable Properties: Find entities where properties can be set directly.
        *   Supply Unexpected Data During Entity Creation/Update:
            *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Modify Sensitive Attributes (CRITICAL NODE):** Change critical attribute values.
    *   **Risk:** High likelihood of identifying vulnerable entities and significant impact (privilege escalation, data manipulation).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious serialized payloads that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify Deserialization Points: Locate areas where deserialization occurs.
    *   Inject Malicious Serialized Payloads: Provide crafted serialized data.
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Risk:** Very low likelihood in core Doctrine, but critical impact if successful (full system compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Lifecycle Callbacks/Listeners](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_lifecycle_callbackslisteners.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate data to trigger malicious actions within lifecycle callback functions.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify Entities with Lifecycle Events: Find entities with defined lifecycle callbacks.
    *   Manipulate Data to Trigger Malicious Actions in Callbacks:
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Execute Arbitrary Code (if callbacks are poorly implemented):** Execute arbitrary code through vulnerable callbacks.
*   **Risk:** Very low likelihood if callbacks are well-implemented, but critical impact if successful (full system compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Access Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_access_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to configuration files to retrieve sensitive information.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify Locations of Doctrine Configuration: Find where configuration files are stored.
    *   Gain Unauthorized Access to Configuration Files:
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Retrieve Database Credentials:** Obtain database usernames and passwords.
*   **Risk:** Low likelihood depending on server security, but critical impact (full database access).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Manipulate Doctrine Metadata](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_doctrine_metadata.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers modify Doctrine's metadata to alter the ORM's behavior and bypass security checks.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify Ways to Influence Doctrine Metadata: Find methods to modify metadata.
    *   Modify Metadata to Alter ORM Behavior:
        *   Bypass Security Checks based on metadata: Circumvent security logic relying on metadata.
*   **Risk:** Very low likelihood due to the complexity, but significant impact (security bypass, data manipulation).
