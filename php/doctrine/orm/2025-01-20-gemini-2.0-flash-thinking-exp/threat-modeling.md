# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/orm

## Threat: [DQL Injection](./threats/dql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is incorporated into a Doctrine Query Language (DQL) query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows the attacker to manipulate the query logic. For example, they might add conditions to bypass authorization checks or inject additional SQL statements to access or modify data they shouldn't.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation if the attacker can manipulate queries related to user roles or permissions.

**Affected Doctrine ORM Component:** `Doctrine\ORM\Query` (specifically the DQL parsing and execution).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use parameterized queries:**  Bind user input as parameters instead of directly embedding it into DQL strings.
*   **Utilize Doctrine's Query Builder:** The Query Builder helps construct queries programmatically, reducing the risk of manual string concatenation errors that can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Input validation:** While not a primary defense against DQL injection, validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats, which can help reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits malicious or unexpected data in a request, and this data is directly used to update entity properties without proper filtering or validation. The attacker might set properties they shouldn't have access to, potentially modifying sensitive data or application state. For example, they could try to set an `isAdmin` flag to `true` on their user object.

**Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation, modification of application logic or state, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Affected Doctrine ORM Component:** `Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager` (specifically the methods used for persisting and updating entities, like `persist()` and `flush()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Explicitly define allowed properties:**  Use mechanisms to specify which entity properties can be modified through user input (e.g., using form handling libraries with whitelisting).
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):**  Use DTOs to receive and validate user input before mapping it to entity properties. This provides a layer of separation and control.
*   **Avoid direct binding of request data to entities:**  Instead of directly setting entity properties from request data, carefully map and validate the data before updating the entity.

## Threat: [Schema Manipulation through Doctrine Migrations (if improperly secured)](./threats/schema_manipulation_through_doctrine_migrations__if_improperly_secured_.md)

**Description:** If access to Doctrine's migration tools is not properly controlled, an attacker could potentially execute malicious migration scripts to alter the database schema. This could involve adding new tables, modifying existing ones, or dropping data.

**Impact:** Data loss, application malfunction, introduction of new vulnerabilities through schema changes.

**Affected Doctrine ORM Component:** `Doctrine\Migrations` (the migration library).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Restrict access to migration commands:**  Ensure that only authorized personnel can execute migration scripts.
*   **Implement code review for migration scripts:**  Review migration scripts for any malicious or unintended changes before execution.
*   **Use version control for migration scripts:**  Track changes to migration scripts and allow for rollback if necessary.
