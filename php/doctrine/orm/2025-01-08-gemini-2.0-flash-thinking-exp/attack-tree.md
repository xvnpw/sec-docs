## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Unauthorized Access to Data [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_unauthorized_access_to_data__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Execute Malicious DQL Queries [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers leverage the Doctrine Query Language (DQL) to inject malicious SQL commands. This occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being incorporated into DQL queries.
        *   **Inject Malicious DQL through User Input [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker's entry point is through user-controllable data.
            *   **Target vulnerable query parameters (e.g., filters, sorting) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers manipulate parameters used in DQL queries (like filtering or sorting criteria) to inject SQL. This can bypass intended data access restrictions.
    *   **Execute Malicious Native SQL Queries [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Even when using an ORM, applications might use raw SQL queries. If user input is directly included in these queries without sanitization, it opens the door to SQL injection.
        *   **Inject Malicious SQL through User Input in Native Queries [CRITICAL NODE]:** Similar to DQL injection, the attacker injects malicious SQL through user-provided data.
            *   **Target vulnerable parameters passed to native queries [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers target parameters specifically used in native SQL queries to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Data [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_data__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Submit unexpected or malicious data during entity creation or updates [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers send unexpected data when creating or updating entities.
        *   **Overwrite sensitive fields that are not intended to be user-modifiable [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  By submitting data for fields that should not be directly modified by users, attackers can alter critical information, bypass business logic, or escalate privileges.
*   **Exploit Lifecycle Callbacks [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Inject malicious code into lifecycle callback methods:** Attackers aim to inject malicious code into the functions that Doctrine ORM executes at specific points in an entity's lifecycle (e.g., before saving, after loading).
        *   **Execute arbitrary code during entity persistence events (e.g., prePersist, postPersist) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** If successful, this allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server whenever a relevant entity event occurs, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Disrupt Application [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__disrupt_application__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Cause Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Execute Resource-Intensive Queries [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers craft queries that consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), making the application slow or unavailable.
        *   **Craft complex DQL or native SQL queries that consume excessive database resources [CRITICAL NODE]:** The core of this attack involves creating deliberately inefficient queries, potentially through exploiting complex joins, missing indexes, or large data retrieval without proper limits.
