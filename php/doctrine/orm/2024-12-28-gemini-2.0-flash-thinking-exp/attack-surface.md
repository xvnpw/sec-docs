*   **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection through DQL
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into dynamically constructed Doctrine Query Language (DQL) queries.
    *   **How ORM Contributes:** Doctrine's flexibility in building DQL queries programmatically can lead to vulnerabilities if user input is directly incorporated into the query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Example:**  A web application allows users to search for products by name. The DQL query is built like this: `$query = $entityManager->createQuery("SELECT p FROM App\Entity\Product p WHERE p.name LIKE '" . $_GET['name'] . "%'");`. An attacker could input `'; DELETE FROM products; --` as the name, leading to unintended database modifications.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use Parameterized Queries:** Utilize Doctrine's parameter binding features (e.g., `setParameter()`) to safely incorporate user input into DQL queries. This prevents the interpretation of user input as SQL code.
        *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate user input before using it in DQL queries. This can involve whitelisting allowed characters or using escaping techniques.

*   **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection through Native Queries
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into raw SQL queries executed through Doctrine's connection interface.
    *   **How ORM Contributes:** While Doctrine encourages using DQL, it also provides methods to execute native SQL queries. If these queries are constructed using unsanitized user input, they are vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Example:**  A developer uses a native query for a specific optimization: `$connection->executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_POST['username'] . "'");`. An attacker could inject SQL code through the `username` field.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameterize Native Queries:**  Use parameterized queries even when executing native SQL through Doctrine's connection. Utilize placeholders and bind parameters.
        *   **Prefer DQL:** Whenever possible, use DQL instead of native queries, as Doctrine provides built-in protection mechanisms for DQL when used correctly.

*   **Attack Surface:** Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Attackers can modify object properties by manipulating the data submitted during entity creation or updates.
    *   **How ORM Contributes:** Doctrine's entity hydration process automatically maps data from requests (e.g., form submissions) to entity properties. If not carefully controlled, attackers can set unintended or sensitive properties.
    *   **Example:** A user registration form directly maps all submitted fields to the `User` entity. An attacker could include an `isAdmin` field in the form data, potentially setting their account as an administrator if the entity doesn't explicitly prevent this.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicitly Define Allowed Fields:**  Use mechanisms like Symfony's Form component with explicit field mappings or manually set entity properties after validating the input. Avoid directly hydrating entities from raw request data without filtering.
        *   **Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**  Create separate DTO classes to handle incoming data and then map the validated data to the entity. This adds a layer of indirection and control.
        *   **Restrict Access Modifiers:** Use appropriate access modifiers (e.g., `private`, `protected`) for sensitive entity properties to prevent direct modification.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Custom DQL Functions or Filters
    *   **Description:** Security flaws in custom DQL functions or filters can introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **How ORM Contributes:** Doctrine allows developers to extend DQL with custom functions and filters. If these custom components are not implemented securely, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A custom DQL function designed to sanitize input might have a bypass vulnerability, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** SQL injection, data manipulation, unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly Review and Test Custom Code:**  Apply the same security scrutiny to custom DQL functions and filters as you would to any other application code.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic SQL Construction in Custom Functions:** If the custom function interacts with the database, use parameterized queries within the function's logic.
        *   **Keep Custom Code Simple:**  Minimize the complexity of custom DQL functions and filters to reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities.
