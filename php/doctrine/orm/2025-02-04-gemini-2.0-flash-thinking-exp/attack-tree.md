## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Doctrine ORM Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_doctrine_orm_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application by exploiting weaknesses related to Doctrine ORM.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Querying Mechanisms [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__exploit_querying_mechanisms__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on attacks that leverage vulnerabilities in how the application constructs and executes database queries using Doctrine ORM.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] DQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Unsafe DQL Construction:**
            *   **Description:**  This is the most common and high-risk DQL injection vector. Developers create DQL queries by directly concatenating user-controlled input into the DQL string without proper sanitization or parameterization.
            *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary database commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, or even complete system takeover depending on database permissions and application logic.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium-High
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Query Builder Misuse [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Logic Flaws in Query Building [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **Description:** Even when using Doctrine's Query Builder, developers can introduce vulnerabilities through logical errors in how they construct queries. This can include insecure filtering, allowing user-controlled sorting columns without validation, or other logical flaws in query construction based on user input.
            *   **Impact:** Can lead to information disclosure (e.g., accessing data users shouldn't see), data manipulation (e.g., modifying records they shouldn't), or denial of service (e.g., by crafting expensive queries).
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Schema Management (Less likely in runtime, more relevant in development/deployment) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3___high_risk_path__exploit_schema_management__less_likely_in_runtime__more_relevant_in_developmentd_2764cccc.md)

*   **Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities in how the application manages its database schema using Doctrine, particularly during development and deployment processes. While less likely to be exploited in a running production application, successful attacks here can have critical consequences.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Schema Manipulation during Development/Deployment [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** If schema migration processes are not properly secured, an attacker who gains access to development or deployment pipelines could inject malicious schema changes. This could involve adding backdoors (e.g., triggers, stored procedures), modifying access controls within the database, or altering data structures to facilitate further attacks.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Can lead to persistent backdoors, complete control over the database, and long-term compromise of the application and its data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (in runtime, higher in compromised development/deployment environments)
        *   **Effort:** Medium-High
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit ORM Internals & Bugs [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk_path__exploit_orm_internals_&_bugs__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting potential vulnerabilities within the Doctrine ORM library itself, including bugs or design weaknesses that could be leveraged for malicious purposes.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK PATH]**
        *   **Description:** Attackers identify and exploit performance bottlenecks or resource exhaustion vulnerabilities within Doctrine ORM. This could involve crafting complex queries that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, database connections) or triggering other resource-intensive operations within the ORM to cause a denial of service.
        *   **Impact:** High. Application becomes unavailable or severely degraded, disrupting services and potentially causing financial or reputational damage.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Highly Unlikely but consider edge cases [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Description:** This represents the most severe, but also least likely, scenario. It involves discovering and exploiting a critical vulnerability within Doctrine ORM's core code that allows for arbitrary code execution on the server. This is extremely rare in mature and widely used libraries like Doctrine, but remains a theoretical possibility for any complex software.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Full system compromise, attacker gains complete control over the server and application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
        *   **Effort:** Very High
        *   **Skill Level:** Very High
