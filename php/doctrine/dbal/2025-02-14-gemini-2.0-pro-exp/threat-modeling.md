# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/dbal

## Threat: [SQL Injection via `executeQuery()` with Unsafe Concatenation](./threats/sql_injection_via__executequery____with_unsafe_concatenation.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via `executeQuery()` with Unsafe Concatenation

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when directly concatenated into a SQL query string passed to `executeQuery()`, alters the query's logic. The attacker injects commands to read, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to complete database compromise. This bypasses application logic and security controls *through DBAL's direct interface*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (reading sensitive data).
        *   Data modification or deletion.
        *   Complete database compromise.
        *   Potential for remote code execution (RCE) on the database server (less common, but possible with certain database configurations).
    *   **Affected DBAL Component:** `Connection::executeQuery()` (when used with raw SQL strings and direct user input concatenation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** *Never* concatenate user input directly into SQL strings. Use parameterized queries with named or positional placeholders. Example: `executeQuery('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id', ['id' => $userInput]);`
        *   **Secondary:** Implement strict input validation *before* passing data to DBAL, even with parameterized queries (defense-in-depth).
        *   **Avoid Raw SQL:** Prefer using the Query Builder (`createQueryBuilder()`) whenever possible.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Query Builder Misuse](./threats/sql_injection_via_query_builder_misuse.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Query Builder Misuse

    *   **Description:**  Even with the Query Builder, an attacker can inject SQL if user input is directly concatenated into *parts* of the query builder's methods, such as `where()`, `andWhere()`, `orWhere()`, `orderBy()`, `groupBy()`, etc. The attacker manipulates these clauses to alter the query's logic *through the DBAL Query Builder API*.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to `executeQuery()` injection: data breach, modification, deletion, or potential database compromise.
    *   **Affected DBAL Component:** `QueryBuilder` methods (e.g., `where()`, `andWhere()`, `orderBy()`, `groupBy()`, `setParameter()`, etc.) when used with direct user input concatenation within the method arguments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Always use `setParameter()` to bind user input to placeholders within Query Builder clauses. Example: `$qb->where('u.id = :id')->setParameter('id', $userInput);`
        *   **Secondary:** Input validation as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Unhandled Exceptions](./threats/data_leakage_via_unhandled_exceptions.md)

*   **Threat:**  Data Leakage via Unhandled Exceptions

    *   **Description:**  DBAL methods can throw exceptions (e.g., `DBALException`) that contain sensitive information, such as database schema details, table names, or even parts of the failed query. If these exceptions, *originating from DBAL*, are not caught and handled properly, and the error message is displayed to the user, it reveals valuable information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information disclosure about the database structure.
        *   Exposure of potentially sensitive data included in error messages.
        *   Facilitates further attacks.
    *   **Affected DBAL Component:** All DBAL methods that can throw exceptions (virtually all methods interacting with the database).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Exception Handling:** Wrap all DBAL calls in `try...catch` blocks. Catch `DBALException` and other relevant exceptions.
        *   **Generic Error Messages:** *Never* display the raw exception message to the user. Display a generic error message.
        *   **Secure Logging:** Log the full exception details securely.
        *   **Production Mode:** Ensure the application is in "production" mode.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Inefficient Queries *Executed Through DBAL*](./threats/denial_of_service_via_inefficient_queries_executed_through_dbal.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via Inefficient Queries *Executed Through DBAL*

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts requests that trigger complex, unoptimized, or resource-intensive queries *through DBAL*. This consumes excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), slowing down or halting the database server, making the application unavailable. This is specifically about queries *executed via DBAL's API*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unavailability.
        *   Performance degradation.
        *   Potential database server crash.
    *   **Affected DBAL Component:** All DBAL methods that execute queries (e.g., `executeQuery()`, `fetchAssociative()`, `fetchAllAssociative()`, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Optimization:** Analyze and optimize all database queries executed through DBAL. Use database profiling tools.
        *   **Indexing:** Ensure proper indexing.
        *   **Query Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for database queries *using DBAL's connection configuration options*.
        *   **Pagination:** Implement pagination using `setMaxResults()` and `setFirstResult()` in the Query Builder.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via `executeUpdate()` with Unsafe Data](./threats/data_tampering_via__executeupdate____with_unsafe_data.md)

* **Threat:** Data Tampering via `executeUpdate()` with Unsafe Data

    * **Description:** Similar to SQL injection with `executeQuery()`, but focused on data modification using `executeUpdate()` (or Query Builder methods like `update()`, `insert()`, `delete()`). An attacker provides malicious input that is used *directly within these DBAL calls* without proper parameterization, allowing unauthorized data modification.
    * **Impact:**
        * Data corruption.
        * Unauthorized data modification.
        * Bypassing of application logic.
    * **Affected DBAL Component:** `Connection::executeUpdate()`, `QueryBuilder::update()`, `QueryBuilder::insert()`, `QueryBuilder::delete()`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Parameterized Queries:** Always use parameterized queries with `executeUpdate()` and the Query Builder's modification methods. Use `setParameter()`.
        * **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation (defense-in-depth).

## Threat: [Schema Manipulation via Unsafe DDL Operations *Through DBAL*](./threats/schema_manipulation_via_unsafe_ddl_operations_through_dbal.md)

* **Threat:** Schema Manipulation via Unsafe DDL Operations *Through DBAL*

    * **Description:** If the application uses DBAL to execute Data Definition Language (DDL) statements (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`), and these statements are constructed using user input without sanitization *within the DBAL calls*, an attacker could manipulate the database schema.
    * **Impact:**
        * Database schema corruption.
        * Data loss.
        * Denial of service.
        * Potential privilege escalation.
    * **Affected DBAL Component:** `Connection::executeStatement()` (when used with DDL statements), `SchemaManager` methods.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid User Input in DDL:** *Never* construct DDL statements directly from user input *that is passed to DBAL*.
        * **Least Privilege:** The database user should not have DDL permissions unless absolutely necessary.
        * **Schema Management Tools:** Use tools like Doctrine Migrations.
