## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: [SQL Injection]](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node__sql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** The core vulnerability enabling attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries. This is the central point of failure for the high-risk paths.
*   **Why it's Critical:** It's the most direct and effective way to compromise the database if not properly mitigated. It allows for data exfiltration, modification, deletion, and potentially even gaining control of the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [Manipulate Data/Queries] -> [SQL Injection] -> [1] Unparameterized Queries [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__manipulate_dataqueries__-__sql_injection__-__1__unparameterized_queries__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The application directly concatenates user-supplied input into SQL queries without using prepared statements or the Query Builder's parameter binding.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if unparameterized queries are present)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full database compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (automated tools readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner (basic SQL injection techniques)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable by WAFs, IDS, code analysis)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Mandatory:** Use prepared statements (`$conn->prepare()`, `$stmt->bindValue()`) or the Query Builder (`$conn->createQueryBuilder()`) with parameter binding for *all* database interactions involving user input.
    *   **Secondary:** Input validation and sanitization (but *never* as the sole defense).
    *   **Additional:** Code reviews, static analysis, WAF.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [Manipulate Data/Queries] -> [SQL Injection] -> [2] Improperly Used Query Builder [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__manipulate_dataqueries__-__sql_injection__-__2__improperly_used_query_builder__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Even when using the Query Builder, incorrect usage (e.g., `expr()->literal()` with untrusted input, dynamic table/column names without whitelisting) can lead to SQL injection.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (requires specific misuse)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full database compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires understanding of Query Builder weaknesses)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (more knowledge than basic SQL injection)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires deeper code analysis)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid `expr()->literal()` with user input.
    *   Strictly whitelist dynamic table/column names.
    *   Thorough Query Builder documentation review.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [Manipulate Data/Queries] -> [SQL Injection] -> [14] Second-Order SQL Injection [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__manipulate_dataqueries__-__sql_injection__-__14__second-order_sql_injection__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Data previously stored in the database (potentially sanitized) is later retrieved and used in *another* query without proper parameterization.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (requires specific data flow and lack of consistent parameterization)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full database compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires understanding data flow)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (understanding of SQL injection and application logic)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires careful data flow analysis)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Treat *all* data retrieved from the database as potentially untrusted.
    *   Always use prepared statements or the Query Builder when constructing new queries based on retrieved data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: [Manipulate Data/Queries] -> [SQL Injection] -> [16] Blind SQL Injection [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__manipulate_dataqueries__-__sql_injection__-__16__blind_sql_injection__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** SQL injection where the attacker doesn't receive direct feedback (e.g., error messages). They infer information by observing application behavior (response changes, timing).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (requires lack of direct feedback)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full database compromise, though slower)
*   **Effort:** High (more time and effort than standard SQL injection)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced (good understanding of SQL injection and application behavior)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (requires sophisticated monitoring)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Same as for standard SQL injection (prepared statements, Query Builder, input validation).
    *   Robust error handling that reveals *no* database-related information.
