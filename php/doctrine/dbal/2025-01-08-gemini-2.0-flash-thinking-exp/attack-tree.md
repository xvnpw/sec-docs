# Attack Tree Analysis for doctrine/dbal

Objective: To gain unauthorized access and control of an application by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the Doctrine DBAL library (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Visualization

```

            └── Access Configuration Files with Weak Permissions
└── OR **Exploit DBAL Query Handling** [CRITICAL]
    └── AND **SQL Injection via Incorrect Parameter Handling** [CRITICAL]
        └── **Bypass Prepared Statements due to Developer Error** [CRITICAL]
            └── **Concatenate User Input Directly into SQL despite using DBAL** [CRITICAL]

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit DBAL Configuration -> Insecure Credential Management -> Retrieve Database Credentials from Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_dbal_configuration_-_insecure_credential_management_-_retrieve_database_cre_d6991651.md)

* **Compromise Application via DBAL Exploitation:** The attacker aims to gain control of the application by exploiting weaknesses in how it interacts with the database through Doctrine DBAL.
* **Exploit DBAL Configuration [CRITICAL]:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities related to how the application is configured to connect to the database. This is a critical node because successful exploitation grants access to sensitive connection details.
* **Insecure Credential Management [CRITICAL]:** The attacker focuses on how database credentials (username, password) are stored and managed. This is a critical node because obtaining these credentials is a direct path to database access.
* **Retrieve Database Credentials from Configuration [CRITICAL]:** The attacker attempts to locate and extract database credentials from configuration files. This is a critical node as it's a common point where credentials are stored.
    * **Access Configuration Files with Weak Permissions:** The attacker exploits insufficient access controls on configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.php`) to read the stored database credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit DBAL Query Handling -> SQL Injection via Incorrect Parameter Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_dbal_query_handling_-_sql_injection_via_incorrect_parameter_handling.md)

* **Compromise Application via DBAL Exploitation:** The attacker aims to gain control of the application by exploiting weaknesses in how it interacts with the database through Doctrine DBAL.
* **Exploit DBAL Query Handling [CRITICAL]:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities in how the application constructs and executes database queries using Doctrine DBAL. This is a critical node because it directly involves manipulating database interactions.
* **SQL Injection via Incorrect Parameter Handling [CRITICAL]:** The attacker attempts to inject malicious SQL code into database queries due to improper handling of user-supplied parameters. This is a critical node as it's a direct exploitation of a common vulnerability.
* **Bypass Prepared Statements due to Developer Error [CRITICAL]:** The attacker relies on developers making mistakes that negate the security benefits of prepared statements. This is a critical node because it highlights a common developer error leading to vulnerabilities.
* **Concatenate User Input Directly into SQL despite using DBAL [CRITICAL]:** The attacker exploits instances where developers directly embed user input into SQL query strings, even when using Doctrine DBAL, creating a classic SQL injection vulnerability. This is the most granular critical node in this path.
