# Attack Surface Analysis for doctrine/dbal

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Raw Queries and Improper Parameter Handling](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_raw_queries_and_improper_parameter_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    *   **How DBAL Contributes:** DBAL provides methods for executing raw SQL queries (`query()`, `exec()`) and relies on developers to correctly use parameterized queries. If developers use raw queries with unsanitized user input or improperly implement parameter binding, DBAL facilitates the execution of malicious SQL.
    *   **Example:**
        ```markdown
        // Vulnerable code:
        $userId = $_GET['user_id'];
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $userId;
        $statement = $connection->query($sql);

        // Safer code using parameters:
        $userId = $_GET['user_id'];
        $statement = $connection->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id");
        $statement->bindValue('id', $userId, \PDO::PARAM_INT);
        $statement->execute();
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) with bound parameters for any user-provided data.
        *   Avoid using raw SQL queries (`query()`, `exec()`) with user input.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the application level as an additional layer of defense.
        *   Use an ORM layer built on top of DBAL (like Doctrine ORM) which encourages and often enforces the use of parameterized queries.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Improper `IN` Clause Handling](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_improper__in__clause_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  When building `IN` clauses dynamically with user-provided data, improper handling can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How DBAL Contributes:** DBAL allows building dynamic queries, and if developers concatenate strings to create `IN` clause values without proper sanitization or parameter binding for each element, it opens the door for injection.
    *   **Example:**
        ```markdown
        // Vulnerable code:
        $ids = $_GET['ids']; // Assume $ids is a comma-separated string like "1,2,3"
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE id IN (" . $ids . ")";
        $statement = $connection->query($sql);

        // Safer code using parameters:
        $idsArray = explode(',', $_GET['ids']);
        $placeholders = implode(',', array_fill(0, count($idsArray), '?'));
        $statement = $connection->prepare("SELECT * FROM products WHERE id IN (" . $placeholders . ")");
        $statement->execute($idsArray);
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   When using `IN` clauses with dynamic values, use parameter binding for each element in the `IN` clause.
        *   Sanitize and validate the input values before constructing the `IN` clause.
        *   Consider using array parameters if the underlying database and DBAL driver support it.

## Attack Surface: [Database-Specific Syntax Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/database-specific_syntax_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers might leverage database-specific syntax or features that are not properly handled or sanitized by the application, leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   **How DBAL Contributes:** While DBAL aims for database abstraction, developers might still use database-specific functions or syntax within their queries executed through DBAL. If these are not handled securely, it can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Using database-specific functions for file access or command execution within a SQL query executed via `$connection->query()`.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution on the database server, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using database-specific syntax or features when possible, sticking to standard SQL.
        *   If database-specific features are necessary, ensure that any user input involved is thoroughly sanitized and validated.
        *   Regularly review and audit SQL queries for potential database-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Database Connections](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_database_connections.md)

*   **Description:** If the connection between the application and the database is not encrypted, sensitive data transmitted can be intercepted.
    *   **How DBAL Contributes:** DBAL relies on the underlying database driver configuration to establish secure connections. If the connection is not configured to use TLS/SSL, DBAL will transmit data in plain text.
    *   **Example:**  Database credentials or sensitive data being transmitted over an unencrypted network connection established using DBAL.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, including credentials and application data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always configure the database connection within the DBAL configuration to use TLS/SSL encryption.
        *   Ensure that the database server is configured to accept only encrypted connections.
        *   Verify the encryption status of the connection during development and deployment.
