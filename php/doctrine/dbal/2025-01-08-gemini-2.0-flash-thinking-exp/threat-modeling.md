# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/dbal

## Threat: [Hardcoded Database Credentials](./threats/hardcoded_database_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the application's codebase or configuration files can retrieve the hardcoded database credentials used by DBAL to connect. This allows them to directly access and manipulate the database.

**Impact:** Full access to the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager::getConnection()` (configuration parameters).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management tools to store and retrieve database credentials. Avoid committing sensitive information directly to version control.

## Threat: [Storing Connection Strings Insecurely](./threats/storing_connection_strings_insecurely.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to configuration files where connection strings used by DBAL are stored in plaintext can obtain sensitive information like database server location, username, and database name. This information can be used for reconnaissance or further attacks.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially facilitating further attacks on the database server.

**Affected Component:** `Doctrine\DBAL\Configuration` (connection parameters).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Secure configuration files with appropriate file system permissions. Consider using encrypted configuration or dedicated secrets management solutions.

## Threat: [Connection String Injection](./threats/connection_string_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate parts of the database connection string if it's dynamically constructed within the application and passed to DBAL without proper sanitization. This could lead to connecting to unintended databases or manipulating connection attributes for malicious purposes.

**Impact:** Connecting to unauthorized databases, potential data breaches or manipulation in those databases.

**Affected Component:** `Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager::getConnection()` (dynamic construction of parameters).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid dynamic construction of connection strings based on untrusted input. If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize any input used in constructing the connection string before passing it to DBAL.

## Threat: [SQL Injection through Improper Parameterization](./threats/sql_injection_through_improper_parameterization.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application's queries if developers fail to use DBAL's parameterized queries correctly or resort to string concatenation when building queries that DBAL executes. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, potential compromise of the database server.

**Affected Component:** `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::executeQuery()`, `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::executeStatement()`, `Doctrine\DBAL\Query\QueryBuilder`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Always use parameterized queries and prepared statements provided by DBAL. Avoid manual string concatenation for building SQL queries that DBAL will execute. Enforce input validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Insecure Query Building with `QueryBuilder`](./threats/insecure_query_building_with__querybuilder_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can influence the generated SQL queries if the application dynamically adds conditions, table names, or column names to the `QueryBuilder` based on unsanitized user input, leading to the execution of unintended or malicious queries by DBAL.

**Impact:** Similar to SQL injection, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `Doctrine\DBAL\Query\QueryBuilder`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Sanitize and validate all user input before incorporating it into `QueryBuilder` operations. Use allowed lists or regular expressions to ensure input conforms to expected formats.

## Threat: [Insecure Migration Execution](./threats/insecure_migration_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker gaining access to the application's deployment environment could potentially execute malicious database migration scripts managed by Doctrine Migrations (often used with DBAL) if the process is not properly secured, leading to schema changes or data manipulation.

**Impact:** Database schema corruption, data breaches, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `Doctrine\Migrations\AbstractMigration`, migration execution process (tightly coupled with DBAL).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement secure migration execution processes. Require explicit authorization for running migrations in production environments. Review migration scripts carefully before execution.
