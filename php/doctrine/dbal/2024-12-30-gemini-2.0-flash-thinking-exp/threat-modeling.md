### High and Critical Doctrine DBAL Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve Doctrine DBAL:

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Parameterized Queries Bypass
    *   **Description:** While DBAL encourages parameterized queries, developers might inadvertently bypass this protection by dynamically constructing parts of the SQL query string *outside* the parameter binding mechanism provided by DBAL. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into these dynamically constructed parts, which is then executed against the database *through DBAL*.
    *   **Impact:**  Ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, privilege escalation within the database, or even command execution on the database server in some cases.
    *   **Affected DBAL Component:** `Doctrine\DBAL\Query\QueryBuilder` (if used incorrectly for dynamic parts), `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::executeQuery()` (if raw SQL is constructed and executed using DBAL).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly adhere to using parameterized queries for all user-provided input *using DBAL's parameter binding features*.
        *   Avoid string concatenation or interpolation for building SQL queries *when using DBAL's query building or execution methods*.
        *   Utilize DBAL's query builder features to enforce parameterization.

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Native Queries
    *   **Description:** Developers use DBAL's functionality to execute raw, native SQL queries directly (e.g., using `$conn->executeQuery($sql)`). If user-provided input is directly included in these raw SQL strings without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code that is executed *via DBAL*.
    *   **Impact:** Same as SQL Injection via Parameterized Queries Bypass - ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, data modification, privilege escalation, or command execution.
    *   **Affected DBAL Component:** `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::executeQuery()`, `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::executeStatement()`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of native SQL queries *when using DBAL*.
        *   If native queries are necessary *with DBAL*, use prepared statements with parameter binding even for native SQL through DBAL's methods.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques before incorporating user input into native SQL queries *executed by DBAL*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Schema Operations via User Input
    *   **Description:** The application allows user input to directly influence database schema operations (e.g., creating, altering, or dropping tables or columns) *through DBAL's schema management features*. An attacker could manipulate this input to perform malicious schema changes *using DBAL's API*.
    *   **Impact:**  Database structure can be compromised, leading to data loss, application malfunction, or the introduction of vulnerabilities that can be exploited later.
    *   **Affected DBAL Component:** `Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\AbstractSchemaManager`, `Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema`, and related methods for schema manipulation *provided by DBAL*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict schema modification operations to administrative tasks and never allow user input to directly influence them *when using DBAL's schema management tools*.
        *   Implement strict authorization controls for any schema management features *that utilize DBAL*.
        *   Separate schema management logic from regular application logic.
