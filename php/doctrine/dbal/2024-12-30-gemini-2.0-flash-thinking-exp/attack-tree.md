**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**

* This represents a broad category of attacks targeting how the application is configured, specifically concerning database access. Success here often grants immediate and significant access.

    * **Expose Sensitive Database Credentials (Critical Node):**  Attackers aim to uncover the credentials needed to access the database. This is a critical step as it bypasses application-level security.
        * **Obtain Hardcoded Credentials (Critical Node):**
            * **Analyze Source Code for Plaintext Credentials:** Attackers examine the application's source code (if accessible through leaks, vulnerabilities, or insider access) looking for database usernames and passwords directly embedded in the code. This is a straightforward but unfortunately common mistake.
        * **Exploit Insecure Credential Storage (Critical Node):**
            * **Access Configuration Files with Weak Permissions:** Attackers target configuration files where database credentials might be stored. If these files have overly permissive access rights, attackers can read them and obtain the credentials. This could be due to misconfigured web servers or insecure deployment practices.

**2. Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path):**

* This is a classic and highly prevalent attack vector where attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed by the application. It's marked as a high-risk path due to its frequency and potential for severe impact.

    * **Leverage Unsanitized User Input in Query Building (High-Risk Path):** This focuses on how user-provided data is incorporated into database queries. If not handled carefully, it opens the door for SQL injection.
        * **Exploit `createQueryBuilder` with Unsafe Input (High-Risk Path):** While `createQueryBuilder` offers parameter binding for safer queries, developers might still introduce vulnerabilities by directly embedding unsanitized user input into clauses like `where`, `orderBy`, or `groupBy`.
            * **Inject Malicious SQL into `where`, `orderBy`, `groupBy`, etc. clauses (High-Risk Path):** Attackers craft input that, when processed by `createQueryBuilder`, results in malicious SQL being executed. For example, manipulating the `where` clause to bypass authentication or retrieve unauthorized data.
        * **Exploit Raw SQL Queries with Unsafe Input (High-Risk Path):** This involves the direct construction of SQL queries using string concatenation, a highly vulnerable practice.
            * **Inject Malicious SQL via String Concatenation (High-Risk Path):** Attackers provide input that is directly inserted into the SQL string. This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or even complete database takeover.
