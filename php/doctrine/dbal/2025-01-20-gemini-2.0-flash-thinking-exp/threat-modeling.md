# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/dbal

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into database queries by manipulating user input that is not properly sanitized or parameterized when constructing queries *using DBAL*. This could involve adding additional SQL clauses, altering existing ones, or executing arbitrary SQL commands *through DBAL's query execution mechanisms*.

**Impact:** Data breach (accessing sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), authentication bypass, potential remote code execution on the database server in severe cases.

**Affected Component:**
* `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`: When using `query()` or `exec()` with unsanitized input.
* `Doctrine\DBAL\Query\QueryBuilder`: If parameters are not used correctly or if raw SQL is incorporated unsafely.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements.** Utilize DBAL's parameter binding features (e.g., `bindValue()`, `bindParam()`, passing parameters to `executeQuery()`).
* **Avoid constructing raw SQL queries directly from user input *within DBAL*.** If absolutely necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization based on the expected data type and format *before passing it to DBAL*.
* **Utilize DBAL's QueryBuilder with named or positional parameters.** This is the recommended and safer way to build queries *using DBAL*.

## Threat: [Connection Pool Exhaustion](./threats/connection_pool_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intentionally or unintentionally cause the application to open and hold onto a large number of database connections *managed by DBAL or the underlying driver*, without releasing them. This can exhaust the connection pool, preventing legitimate users from accessing the database and potentially leading to application crashes or denial of service.

**Impact:** Application downtime, denial of service, performance degradation.

**Affected Component:**
* `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`:  The object representing a database connection *managed by DBAL*.
* `Doctrine\DBAL\Configuration`: Settings related to connection pooling (if implemented by the underlying driver and configured through DBAL).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Configure appropriate connection pool settings (e.g., maximum connections, idle timeout) *within DBAL's configuration or the underlying driver's configuration as exposed by DBAL*, based on application needs and database server capacity.**
* **Ensure connections obtained *through DBAL* are properly closed after use using `finally` blocks or try-with-resources constructs.**
* **Monitor database connection usage *as reported by DBAL or the database server* and identify potential leaks.**
* **Implement rate limiting or other mechanisms to prevent excessive connection attempts from a single source *at the application level interacting with DBAL*.

## Threat: [Stored Procedures/Functions Misuse](./threats/stored_proceduresfunctions_misuse.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on stored procedures or functions, vulnerabilities within these database objects can be exploited *through DBAL*. This includes SQL injection within the stored procedure itself or unintended side effects due to incorrect parameter handling when calling the procedure *via DBAL*.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential server compromise depending on the privileges of the stored procedure.

**Affected Component:**
* `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection`: When using methods like `executeStatement()` or `executeQuery()` to call stored procedures or functions.
* Parameter binding mechanisms used when calling stored procedures *through DBAL*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Apply the same security principles to stored procedures and functions as to application code, including input validation and parameterized queries within the stored procedure itself.**
* **Review the code of stored procedures and functions for potential vulnerabilities.**
* **Restrict the permissions of the database user used by the application *when interacting with DBAL* to only the necessary stored procedures and functions.**
* **Use parameterized calls when executing stored procedures *through DBAL*.
