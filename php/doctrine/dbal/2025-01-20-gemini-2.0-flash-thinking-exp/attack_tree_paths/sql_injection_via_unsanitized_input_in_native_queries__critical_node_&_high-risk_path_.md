### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Native Queries

**Vulnerability Description:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the direct execution of SQL queries constructed by concatenating user-provided input with static SQL strings when using Doctrine DBAL's `query()` or `executeStatement()` methods. When developers fail to properly sanitize or parameterize user input before embedding it into these raw SQL queries, they open a direct pathway for attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Technical Breakdown:**

Doctrine DBAL's `query()` and `executeStatement()` methods are designed to execute arbitrary SQL statements. When a developer constructs a SQL string by directly embedding user input, the database treats the entire resulting string as a command. An attacker can exploit this by crafting input that, when inserted into the SQL string, alters the intended logic of the query.

For example, consider a scenario where a user searches for products by name. The developer might construct the query like this:

```php
$productName = $_GET['name'];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '" . $productName . "'";
$statement = $connection->query($sql);
```

If the user provides the input `'; DROP TABLE products; --`, the resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = ''; DROP TABLE products; --'
```

The database will execute this modified query, first selecting products with an empty name (which might return no results), then executing the `DROP TABLE products` command, effectively deleting the entire `products` table. The `--` characters are used to comment out the remaining part of the original query, preventing syntax errors.

**Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:**

Let's consider a simplified user authentication scenario:

1. **Vulnerable Code:** A login form takes a username and password. The application uses Doctrine DBAL's `query()` method to authenticate the user:

   ```php
   $username = $_POST['username'];
   $password = $_POST['password'];

   $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $username . "' AND password = '" . $password . "'";
   $statement = $connection->query($sql);
   $user = $statement->fetchAssociative();

   if ($user) {
       // Authentication successful
   } else {
       // Authentication failed
   }
   ```

2. **Attacker Input:** An attacker enters the following username: `admin' --` and any password.

3. **Constructed SQL Query:** The application constructs the following SQL query:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'any_password'
   ```

4. **Execution and Exploitation:** The `--` characters comment out the rest of the `WHERE` clause. The query effectively becomes:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'
   ```

   This query will return the user with the username 'admin', regardless of the password provided. The attacker successfully bypasses the password check and gains unauthorized access.

**Potential Impact:**

The impact of a successful SQL injection attack via unsanitized input can be severe and far-reaching:

* **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary data.
* **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify, insert, or delete data, leading to data corruption, financial loss, and reputational damage.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can potentially gain access to administrative accounts or functionalities by manipulating queries related to user roles and permissions.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can execute queries that consume excessive database resources, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
* **Code Execution:** In some database configurations, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the database server.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

The most effective way to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities in Doctrine DBAL is to **avoid constructing SQL queries by directly concatenating user input**. Instead, utilize parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements).

Here are the key mitigation strategies:

1. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**
   - **How it works:** Parameterized queries separate the SQL structure from the user-provided data. Placeholders are used in the SQL query, and the actual data is passed separately to the database. The database then treats the data as literal values, preventing it from being interpreted as SQL code.
   - **Doctrine DBAL Implementation:** Use the `prepare()` method to create a prepared statement and then bind parameters using `bindValue()` or `bindParam()`. Finally, execute the statement using `executeQuery()` or `executeStatement()`.

   ```php
   $username = $_POST['username'];
   $password = $_POST['password'];

   $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password = :password";
   $statement = $connection->prepare($sql);
   $statement->bindValue('username', $username);
   $statement->bindValue('password', $password);
   $result = $statement->executeQuery();
   $user = $result->fetchAssociative();
   ```

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization (Secondary Defense):**
   - While parameterized queries are the primary defense, input validation and sanitization can provide an additional layer of security.
   - **Validation:** Verify that the user input conforms to the expected format, length, and data type. Reject invalid input.
   - **Sanitization:**  Escape or remove potentially harmful characters from user input. However, **relying solely on sanitization is not recommended** as it can be bypassed.
   - **Doctrine DBAL Context:**  While DBAL doesn't offer built-in sanitization functions specifically for SQL injection prevention (as parameterization is the preferred method), you can use general-purpose sanitization functions for other purposes (e.g., preventing XSS).

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
   - Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject SQL code.

4. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application. However, it should be considered a supplementary defense and not a replacement for secure coding practices.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
   - Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities and other security flaws.

**Code Examples:**

**Vulnerable Code (Using `query()` with unsanitized input):**

```php
$searchQuery = $_GET['query'];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE description LIKE '%" . $searchQuery . "%'";
$statement = $connection->query($sql);
$items = $statement->fetchAllAssociative();
```

**Secure Code (Using parameterized query with `prepare()` and `executeQuery()`):**

```php
$searchQuery = $_GET['query'];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE description LIKE :query";
$statement = $connection->prepare($sql);
$statement->bindValue('query', '%' . $searchQuery . '%');
$items = $statement->executeQuery()->fetchAllAssociative();
```

**Vulnerable Code (Using `executeStatement()` with unsanitized input for data insertion):**

```php
$newUsername = $_POST['new_username'];
$newEmail = $_POST['new_email'];
$sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('" . $newUsername . "', '" . $newEmail . "')";
$connection->executeStatement($sql);
```

**Secure Code (Using parameterized query with `prepare()` and `executeStatement()` for data insertion):**

```php
$newUsername = $_POST['new_username'];
$newEmail = $_POST['new_email'];
$sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (:username, :email)";
$statement = $connection->prepare($sql);
$statement->bindValue('username', $newUsername);
$statement->bindValue('email', $newEmail);
$connection->executeStatement($statement);
```

### 5. Conclusion

The "SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Native Queries" attack path represents a critical and high-risk vulnerability in applications using Doctrine DBAL. Directly embedding user input into raw SQL queries exposes the application to severe security risks, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and other significant consequences.

The development team must prioritize the use of parameterized queries as the primary defense mechanism against this type of SQL injection. By separating SQL structure from user data, parameterized queries effectively prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code. Adopting secure coding practices, including input validation (as a secondary measure), adhering to the principle of least privilege, and conducting regular security assessments, are crucial for building robust and secure applications with Doctrine DBAL. Understanding the mechanics and potential impact of this vulnerability is the first step towards effectively mitigating it.
