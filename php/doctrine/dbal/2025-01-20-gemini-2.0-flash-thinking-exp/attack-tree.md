## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Connection Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_connection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on compromising the initial connection to the database, which is a fundamental requirement for the application to function. Success here often grants broad access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Database Credentials [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_database_credentials__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's goal of acquiring valid database credentials. If successful, the attacker can bypass application security and directly access the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stolen Credentials from Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/stolen_credentials_from_configuration_files__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target configuration files where database credentials might be stored, often in plaintext or weakly encrypted. This could involve accessing the file system through vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion (LFI), gaining access to the server, or exploiting insecure deployment practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stolen Credentials from Environment Variables [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/stolen_credentials_from_environment_variables__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to access environment variables where credentials might be stored. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities that allow reading environment variables, such as certain server-side vulnerabilities or insecure container configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Connection Parameters [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_connection_parameters__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

This critical node focuses on altering the parameters used to establish the database connection, potentially leading to security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Connection String Injection [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/connection_string_injection__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application dynamically constructs the database connection string using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious parameters. This could involve:
                * Redirecting the connection to a malicious database server controlled by the attacker.
                * Injecting parameters that alter the authentication process or bypass security measures.
                * Injecting parameters that enable features that should be disabled for security reasons.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Execution Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_execution_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the application constructs and executes database queries, potentially leading to SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Parameterization/Escaping [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_parameterizationescaping__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

This critical node represents scenarios where the intended security measures of parameterization or escaping are circumvented, leading to SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Native Queries [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_native_queries__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** When developers use DBAL's `query()` or `executeStatement()` methods with raw SQL strings that include unsanitized user input, they create a direct SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the input, which will be executed directly by the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse DBAL Features for Malicious Purposes [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_dbal_features_for_malicious_purposes__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

This critical node focuses on misusing legitimate DBAL features to execute malicious SQL.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leveraging `query()` or `executeStatement()` with Malicious SQL [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/leveraging__query____or__executestatement____with_malicious_sql__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Even if parameterization is used elsewhere, if an attacker can influence the SQL string passed to `query()` or `executeStatement()` through other means (e.g., logic flaws, insecure deserialization leading to object injection), they can execute arbitrary SQL. This differs from the previous point as it might not directly involve user input in the typical sense but rather manipulation of the query construction process.
