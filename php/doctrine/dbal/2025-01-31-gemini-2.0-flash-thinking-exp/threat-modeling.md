# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/dbal

## Threat: [Insecure Database Connection Settings](./threats/insecure_database_connection_settings.md)

* **Description:** Attackers could exploit insecure database connection configurations within DBAL. Using unencrypted connections (e.g., `mysql://` instead of `mysqls://`) allows eavesdropping on database traffic. Weak authentication methods or exposing database credentials insecurely can lead to unauthorized database access. For example, if connection parameters are hardcoded in publicly accessible configuration files or transmitted over unencrypted channels, attackers can intercept them.
* **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks (eavesdropping on database communication, potentially capturing credentials), unauthorized database access, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
* **DBAL Component Affected:** `DriverManager`, `Connection` configuration, specifically the connection parameters and DSN parsing.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Use Encrypted Connections (TLS/SSL):**  Always configure DBAL to use encrypted connections (e.g., `mysqls://`, `pgsql://`) for database communication, especially in production. Ensure TLS/SSL is properly configured on both the database server and the application.
    * **Secure Credential Management:** Store database credentials securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.), or encrypted configuration files. Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in code or plain text configuration files.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Users):** Configure database users used by the application with the minimum necessary privileges required for the application to function.
    * **Secure Configuration Management:** Implement secure configuration management practices to protect configuration files containing database connection details. Restrict access to these files and use appropriate permissions.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in DBAL Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_dbal_library.md)

* **Description:** Attackers could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities present within the Doctrine DBAL library itself. These vulnerabilities could be in the core logic of DBAL, its query parsing, data handling, or any other component. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to various security breaches, potentially including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
* **Impact:** Varies significantly depending on the specific vulnerability. Potential impacts range from denial of service (crashing the application or database), information disclosure (leaking sensitive data), data manipulation, to remote code execution (allowing attackers to gain control of the server).
* **DBAL Component Affected:** Core DBAL library code. Any part of DBAL, including `QueryBuilder`, `Connection`, `SchemaManager`, `Platforms`, and `Drivers`, could potentially be affected depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regular DBAL Updates:**  Maintain a process for regularly updating the Doctrine DBAL library to the latest stable version. This ensures that security patches and bug fixes are applied promptly.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning tools into the development and deployment pipeline to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in DBAL and its dependencies.
    * **Security Monitoring and Incident Response:** Implement robust security monitoring to detect unusual activity that might indicate exploitation of DBAL vulnerabilities. Establish a clear incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively.
    * **Follow Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Doctrine DBAL and the PHP ecosystem to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and recommended updates or mitigations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Database Drivers Used by DBAL](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_database_drivers_used_by_dbal.md)

* **Description:** Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the database drivers (e.g., PDO drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) that DBAL relies upon to interact with specific database systems. These drivers are external components, and vulnerabilities within them can indirectly affect applications using DBAL. Exploiting driver vulnerabilities could lead to similar impacts as DBAL library vulnerabilities, including remote code execution or denial of service.
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the driver vulnerability. Potential impacts can include remote code execution (allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server), denial of service (crashing the application or database server), or other forms of compromise depending on the specific flaw.
* **DBAL Component Affected:** Database drivers (e.g., PDO extensions) used by DBAL's `Driver` implementations. While not directly DBAL code, the vulnerability in the driver directly impacts applications using DBAL through those drivers.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Update Database Drivers:**  Keep database drivers updated to the latest stable versions provided by the database vendor or the PHP community. Regularly check for and apply driver updates.
    * **Operating System Updates:** Ensure the operating system and package manager are up-to-date, as driver updates are often distributed through OS package managers. Regularly apply OS security updates.
    * **Driver Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories and release notes for the specific database drivers being used. Stay informed about known vulnerabilities and recommended updates or mitigations.
    * **Minimize Driver Exposure:** Only install and enable the database drivers that are actually required by the application. Disable or remove any unused drivers to reduce the potential attack surface.
