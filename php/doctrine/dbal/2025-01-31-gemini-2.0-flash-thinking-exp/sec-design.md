# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Doctrine DBAL (Database Abstraction Layer), aims to provide a powerful and feature-rich abstraction layer for accessing various database systems from PHP applications. It simplifies database interactions by providing a consistent API regardless of the underlying database engine.

## Business Priorities and Goals

-   Provide a stable and reliable database abstraction layer for PHP developers.
-   Support a wide range of database systems, ensuring compatibility and ease of switching databases.
-   Offer a performant and efficient way to interact with databases, minimizing overhead.
-   Simplify database operations, reducing code complexity and development time for PHP applications.
-   Maintain a high level of security to protect applications and data from database-related vulnerabilities.
-   Foster a strong community and provide ongoing maintenance and updates.

## Business Risks

-   Data breaches due to vulnerabilities in the DBAL leading to SQL injection or other database exploits.
-   Application downtime or instability caused by bugs or performance issues in the DBAL.
-   Compatibility issues with new database versions or PHP versions, requiring significant maintenance effort.
-   Loss of developer trust and adoption if the DBAL is perceived as insecure or unreliable.
-   Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies of the DBAL project.

# SECURITY POSTURE

## Existing Security Controls

-   security control: Open Source Code - The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
-   security control: Public Issue Tracker - Security vulnerabilities can be reported and tracked publicly. Implemented in: GitHub Issues.
-   security control: Community Contributions -  Security patches and improvements can be contributed by the community. Implemented in: GitHub Pull Requests.
-   security control: Unit and Integration Tests -  Tests are in place to ensure the functionality and stability of the DBAL, which can indirectly contribute to security by preventing bugs. Implemented in: GitHub repository - tests directory.
-   security control: Version Control - Git is used for version control, allowing for tracking changes and reverting to previous versions if necessary. Implemented in: GitHub.

## Accepted Risks

-   accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies - The project relies on third-party libraries, which may contain vulnerabilities.
-   accepted risk: Undiscovered vulnerabilities - Despite efforts, there may be undiscovered security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
-   accepted risk: Security misconfigurations by users - Users may misconfigure the DBAL or their database connections, leading to security issues.
-   accepted risk: Denial of Service attacks against applications using DBAL.

## Recommended Security Controls

-   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Implement automated SAST tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
-   security control: Dependency Scanning - Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
-   security control: Fuzzing - Perform fuzz testing to identify potential input validation vulnerabilities and edge cases.
-   security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses.
-   security control: Secure Release Process - Implement a secure release process that includes security checks and code signing.
-   security control: Input Validation Framework -  Promote and document best practices for input validation when using DBAL to prevent SQL injection.

## Security Requirements

-   Authentication:
    -   Requirement: DBAL itself does not handle user authentication, but it must securely manage database credentials provided by the application.
    -   Requirement: Connection strings should be handled securely and not hardcoded in the application.
-   Authorization:
    -   Requirement: DBAL should facilitate the implementation of database-level authorization by the application.
    -   Requirement:  Ensure that database connections are established with the principle of least privilege.
-   Input Validation:
    -   Requirement: DBAL must provide mechanisms to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by properly escaping or parameterizing user inputs in database queries.
    -   Requirement:  The API should encourage or enforce the use of prepared statements and parameterized queries.
-   Cryptography:
    -   Requirement: DBAL should support secure connections to databases using encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL).
    -   Requirement:  If DBAL handles sensitive data in transit or at rest (e.g., connection strings), it should be encrypted appropriately.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Critical Business Processes

The critical business processes that Doctrine DBAL helps to protect are those of the applications that depend on it for database access. These processes include:

-   Data storage and retrieval for applications.
-   Transaction processing and data integrity within applications.
-   Application functionality that relies on database interactions (which is often a core part of many applications).

If DBAL is compromised or has vulnerabilities, it can directly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these business processes.

## Data Sensitivity

The data being protected is the data stored in the databases accessed through Doctrine DBAL. The sensitivity of this data varies greatly depending on the application using DBAL. It can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal data, financial records, or trade secrets.

-   Sensitivity levels can include:
    -   Public: Data intended for public consumption.
    -   Internal: Data intended for internal use within an organization.
    -   Confidential: Sensitive data that requires protection to prevent unauthorized disclosure, such as personal data or financial information.
    -   Highly Confidential: Extremely sensitive data that requires the highest level of protection, such as trade secrets or critical infrastructure data.

The security measures implemented for applications using DBAL must be commensurate with the sensitivity of the data being processed and stored.
