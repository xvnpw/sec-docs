# Attack Surface Analysis for doctrine/instantiator

## Attack Surface: [Bypassing Constructor Logic](./attack_surfaces/bypassing_constructor_logic.md)

**Description:** The primary function of `Instantiator` is to create instances of classes without invoking their constructors. This means any initialization logic, security checks, or state setup within the constructor is completely skipped.

**How Instantiator Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  `Instantiator` directly enables this bypass, providing a mechanism to create objects in an uninitialized state.

**Example:** A class `User` has a constructor that sets the `isAdmin` property to `false`. Using `Instantiator`, an attacker can create a `User` object where `isAdmin` remains undefined or has a default value, potentially allowing unauthorized access if this property is checked later without proper initialization handling.

**Impact:** Creation of objects in an invalid or insecure state, bypassing security checks, potential for unexpected behavior due to uninitialized dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Minimize usage:**  Only use `Instantiator` when absolutely necessary and understand the implications of bypassing constructors.
* **Post-instantiation initialization:** If constructor bypass is required, implement explicit initialization methods or factory patterns to ensure the object is in a valid state after instantiation.
* **Defensive programming:** Design classes to be resilient to being in an uninitialized state. Validate object state before use.
* **Consider alternatives:** Explore alternative object creation methods if constructor logic is critical for security or functionality.

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Class Name Injection](./attack_surfaces/indirect_class_name_injection.md)

**Description:**  While `Instantiator` itself doesn't take user input for class names, if the class name is derived from external, potentially attacker-controlled sources (e.g., configuration files, database entries), an attacker might influence which class is instantiated.

**How Instantiator Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `Instantiator` provides the mechanism to instantiate a class based on a provided name. If this name is not properly sanitized or validated, it can be exploited.

**Example:** An application uses a configuration file to determine which logger class to instantiate using `Instantiator`. An attacker could modify the configuration file to specify a malicious class, which would then be instantiated and potentially executed.

**Impact:** Instantiation of unexpected or malicious classes leading to code execution, denial of service, or other vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strictly control class name sources:**  Limit the sources from which class names are derived and ensure these sources are trustworthy.
* **Whitelist class names:** Implement a whitelist of allowed class names and only instantiate classes that are on this list.
* **Input validation:** Sanitize and validate any input used to determine the class name before passing it to `Instantiator`.
* **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to prevent the instantiation of sensitive classes.
