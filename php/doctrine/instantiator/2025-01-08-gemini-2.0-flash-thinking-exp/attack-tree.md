## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Doctrine Instantiator CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_doctrine_instantiator_critical_node.md)

*   This is the overarching goal. Success at this node signifies that an attacker has successfully leveraged a vulnerability related to Doctrine Instantiator to compromise the application. This can be achieved through various attack paths detailed below.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Uninitialized Object State -> Bypass Security Checks HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_uninitialized_object_state_-_bypass_security_checks_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the fact that Doctrine Instantiator bypasses the constructor. If security checks or authentication/authorization logic relies on properties being initialized within the constructor, instantiating an object without calling the constructor leaves these properties in an uninitialized or default state. The attacker can then manipulate the application to use this uninitialized object, effectively bypassing the intended security measures.
*   **Example:** A user object might have an `isAdmin` property set to `false` in the constructor. By bypassing the constructor, this property might remain unset or have a default value that allows the attacker to perform administrative actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Magic Methods -> Exploit __wakeup HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_magic_methods_-_exploit___wakeup_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker crafts a serialized object of a class that is intended to be instantiated via Doctrine Instantiator. By bypassing the constructor, the object's internal state is not properly initialized. When this crafted object is unserialized, the `__wakeup` magic method is invoked. If the `__wakeup` logic relies on properties that were supposed to be initialized by the constructor, it might operate on an invalid state, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other unintended consequences.
*   **Example:** A class might have a `__wakeup` method that attempts to establish a database connection using credentials stored in object properties. If the constructor is bypassed, these properties might be missing or incorrect, leading to a connection to a malicious database or an error that can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Magic Methods -> Exploit __unserialize (PHP >= 7.4) HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_magic_methods_-_exploit___unserialize__php_=_7_4__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to exploiting `__wakeup`, the attacker crafts a serialized object. With PHP 7.4 and later, the `__unserialize` magic method offers a more controlled way to handle unserialization. If the constructor is bypassed, and the `__unserialize` method expects certain properties to be initialized by the constructor, it might operate on an invalid state. This can lead to vulnerabilities if the `__unserialize` logic is not designed to handle such scenarios, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Example:** A class might use `__unserialize` to restore object state based on data initialized in the constructor. If the constructor is bypassed, the data needed by `__unserialize` might be absent or invalid, leading to exploitable conditions within the `__unserialize` method itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Class Name Injection / Manipulation CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/class_name_injection__manipulation_critical_node.md)

*   This node represents a critical control point. If an attacker can influence or control the class name that is passed to the Doctrine Instantiator, they can dictate which class is instantiated, opening up a wide range of potential attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Class Name Injection / Manipulation -> Direct Class Name Injection HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/class_name_injection__manipulation_-_direct_class_name_injection_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application directly uses user-controlled input to determine the class name that will be instantiated using Doctrine Instantiator. This is a highly dangerous practice as it allows the attacker to specify any class available to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Class Name Injection / Manipulation -> Direct Class Name Injection -> Instantiate Arbitrary Application Class HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/class_name_injection__manipulation_-_direct_class_name_injection_-_instantiate_arbitrary_application_8a2c2bf2.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Building upon direct class name injection, the attacker provides the name of an existing class within the application. This class might have a vulnerable destructor or other methods that perform actions upon object creation or destruction. By instantiating this arbitrary application class, the attacker can trigger these unintended actions.
*   **Example:** An attacker could instantiate a logging class with a destructor that writes to a file path controlled by the attacker, potentially overwriting sensitive system files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Class Name Injection / Manipulation -> Direct Class Name Injection -> Instantiate PHP Internal Class HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/class_name_injection__manipulation_-_direct_class_name_injection_-_instantiate_php_internal_class_hi_bc116ccc.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker provides the name of a built-in PHP class to the Instantiator. Certain PHP internal classes have functionalities that can be abused if instantiated without the expected context.
*   **Example:** Instantiating `SplObjectStorage` might be used in subsequent attacks if the application mishandles this object. Instantiating `SimpleXMLElement` with external entity loading enabled (if configured) can lead to XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerabilities, potentially allowing the attacker to read local files or interact with external systems.
