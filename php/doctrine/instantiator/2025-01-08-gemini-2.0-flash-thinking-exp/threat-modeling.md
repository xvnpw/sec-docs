# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/instantiator

## Threat: [Bypassing Constructor Security Checks](./threats/bypassing_constructor_security_checks.md)

**Description:** Attackers can directly use `Instantiator::instantiate()` to create instances of classes, completely bypassing any security checks implemented within the class constructor. This allows the instantiation of objects that should not be created under normal circumstances, potentially leading to access control violations or the creation of insecurely configured objects.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, access to sensitive data, circumvention of access controls.

**Affected Component:** `Instantiator::instantiate()`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the direct use of `Instantiator::instantiate()`, especially for security-sensitive classes.
*   Implement security checks outside of constructors if `Instantiator` is used.
*   Consider alternative object creation mechanisms when security is a primary concern.

## Threat: [Gadget Creation in Deserialization Scenarios via `Instantiator`](./threats/gadget_creation_in_deserialization_scenarios_via__instantiator_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate deserialization processes to use `Instantiator::instantiate()` to create instances of specific classes within the application. By carefully crafting the serialized data, they can then populate the object's properties in a way that triggers a chain of method calls (a "gadget chain"), ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution. This threat directly leverages `Instantiator`'s ability to create objects without constructor invocation as a step in the exploit chain.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** `Instantiator::instantiate()` in conjunction with PHP's unserialize functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid unserializing data from untrusted sources.
*   Implement strict whitelisting of classes allowed for deserialization, preventing `Instantiator` from being used on unintended classes.
*   Utilize secure serialization formats and libraries.
*   Regularly audit code for potential deserialization vulnerabilities and gadget chains involving `Instantiator`.
