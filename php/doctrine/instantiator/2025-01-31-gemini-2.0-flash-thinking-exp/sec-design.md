# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Doctrine Instantiator, is a PHP library designed to instantiate classes without invoking their constructors. It serves as a foundational component for other software, particularly within the PHP ecosystem, often used in Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), testing frameworks, and dependency injection containers.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a stable and reliable mechanism for object instantiation in PHP.
- Offer a performant solution to avoid constructor execution when not needed.
- Maintain compatibility with various PHP versions and environments.
- Ensure ease of integration and use for developers.
- Foster community adoption and contribution to ensure long-term viability.

Business Risks:
- Vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by dependent software, leading to security issues in applications using Doctrine Instantiator.
- Instability or bugs could disrupt the functionality of dependent software, impacting application reliability.
- Poor performance could negatively affect the performance of applications relying on the library.
- Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated and unusable over time.
- Supply chain attacks targeting the library could compromise applications that depend on it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Version Control - Git is used for version control, providing history and traceability of changes. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Issue Tracking - GitHub Issues are used for bug reports and feature requests, allowing for community feedback and vulnerability reporting. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Testing - Unit tests are included in the repository to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. Implemented: `tests/` directory and CI configuration.
- security control: Static Analysis - Likely performed by developers locally and potentially integrated into CI pipelines (though not explicitly stated in the repository). Implemented: Developer practices and potential CI integration.
- security control: Dependency Management - Composer is used for managing dependencies. Implemented: `composer.json` and `composer.lock`.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions - Security depends on the vigilance of the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies could indirectly affect the library.
- accepted risk: Lack of Formal Security Audits -  No explicit mention of regular professional security audits.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Security Policy - Define and publish a security policy outlining how vulnerabilities should be reported and handled.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Consider periodic security audits by security professionals to identify potential weaknesses.
- security control: Signed Releases - Sign releases to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is relevant for systems that *use* this library, but not the library itself.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is relevant for systems that *use* this library.
- Input Validation: While the library's primary function is instantiation, input validation is crucial in the context of how the library is *used*.  Applications using this library must ensure that class names and other inputs provided to the instantiator are properly validated to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the application itself. The library should be robust against invalid class names or unexpected input types, failing gracefully and predictably.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of the instantiator library itself. However, if future features or dependencies introduce cryptographic operations, they must be implemented securely, following best practices and using well-vetted cryptographic libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Software development within the PHP ecosystem that relies on object instantiation without constructor invocation.
- Functionality of ORMs, frameworks, testing tools, and other libraries that depend on Doctrine Instantiator.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Source code of Doctrine Instantiator: Intellectual property, contains logic and potential vulnerabilities. High sensitivity.
- Packaged library (distributed via Packagist):  Integrity and availability are crucial for dependent projects. High sensitivity.
- Build artifacts and CI/CD pipeline configurations:  Secrets and configurations that could be exploited to compromise the build or publishing process. High sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Is there a formal security policy for reporting and handling vulnerabilities?
- Are there any plans for regular security audits?
- Are releases signed to ensure integrity?
- What static analysis tools are currently used, if any?
- Is dependency vulnerability scanning currently implemented in the CI/CD pipeline?

Assumptions:
- The project is intended for use in production environments and requires a reasonable level of security.
- The project maintainers are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities.
- The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Developers using the library are responsible for input validation in their own applications.
- Packagist provides a reasonably secure platform for package distribution.
