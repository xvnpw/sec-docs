# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for doctrine/instantiator

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Type Hinting (Pre-Instantiation)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_type_hinting__pre-instantiation_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Whitelist:** Create a configuration file or a dedicated class that maintains a list of fully qualified class names that are explicitly allowed to be instantiated using `doctrine/instantiator`. This list should be as restrictive as possible.
    2.  **Validate Class Name:** *Before* calling `$instantiator->instantiate($className)`, check if `$className` exists within the whitelist.  Use a strict comparison (`in_array($className, $whitelist, true)`).
    3.  **Check Class Existence:** Use `class_exists($className)` to verify that the class actually exists. This prevents attempts to instantiate non-existent classes *before* passing the name to `Instantiator`.
    4.  **Type Hinting and Reflection (Optional but Recommended):** If possible, use reflection (`new \ReflectionClass($className)`) to further inspect the class *before* passing it to `Instantiator`. You might check if it implements a specific interface or extends a particular base class.
    5.  **Centralized Instantiation Logic:** Encapsulate the instantiation logic (whitelist check, `class_exists`, reflection, and the `Instantiator` call) within a single factory method or dedicated service.
    6.  **Error Handling:** If validation fails, throw an exception or log the attempt. *Never* proceed with `$instantiator->instantiate()` if validation fails.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Class Instantiation (Critical):** Prevents attackers from using `Instantiator` to create any class.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Limits `Instantiator`'s ability to create resource-intensive classes.
    *   **Code Injection (Critical):** Prevents `Instantiator` from being used with injected malicious class names.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Class Instantiation:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `App\Factory\DataObjectFactory::create()`: Implements whitelist and `class_exists()`.
    *   `App\Service\LegacyDataImporter`: *Does not* implement validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `App\Service\LegacyDataImporter`: Needs refactoring.
    *   Whitelist in `DataObjectFactory` should be in a config file.
    *   Reflection checks are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Post-Instantiation Validation and Initialization](./mitigation_strategies/post-instantiation_validation_and_initialization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define an Initialization Method:** For every class instantiated with `doctrine/instantiator`, create a public method (e.g., `initialize()`).
    2.  **Mandatory Call:** *Immediately after* calling `$instantiator->instantiate($className)`, call the initialization method on the object.
    3.  **Property Validation:** Inside the initialization method, validate all relevant object properties.
    4.  **Default Values:** Set default values for properties not provided during initialization.
    5.  **Security Checks:** Perform security checks that would normally be in the constructor.
    6.  **Exception Handling:** If validation/security checks fail, throw an exception. Do *not* allow the object to be used.
    7.  **Interface (Optional):** Consider a common interface (e.g., `InitializableInterface`) requiring the `initialize()` method.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Use of Uninitialized Objects (High):** Prevents using objects with uninitialized properties.
    *   **Bypassing Security Checks (Critical):** Ensures security checks are executed, even with a bypassed constructor.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium):** Validates property values, mitigating data corruption.
    *   **Logic Errors (Medium):** Consistent initialization prevents logic errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Use of Uninitialized Objects:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Bypassing Security Checks:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `App\Model\DataObject`: Implements `initialize()`, called after instantiation via `DataObjectFactory`.
    *   `App\Model\LegacyEntity`: Has `hydrate()`, but not consistently called.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `App\Service\LegacyDataImporter`: Doesn't consistently call `hydrate()` on `LegacyEntity`.
    *   No common interface (e.g., `InitializableInterface`) is used.
    *   Not all classes instantiated via `Instantiator` have an initialization method.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Logging of Instantiator Use](./mitigation_strategies/logging_of_instantiator_use.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Log Every Call:**  Directly within the code where `$instantiator->instantiate($className)` is called, add a logging statement.
    2.  **Detailed Information:**  The log entry *must* include:
        *   The fully qualified `$className`.
        *   The context (calling function, user ID, request ID, etc.).
        *   Any input data used to determine `$className`.
    3.  **Error Handling:** If an exception is caught during the instantiation process (either before or after the `Instantiator` call), log the exception details along with the class name and context.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Detection of Exploits (Variable):**  Provides visibility into *how* `Instantiator` is being used, aiding in detecting attacks.
    *   **Auditing and Forensics (High):** Enables investigation of security incidents specifically related to object instantiation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Detection:** Improves the ability to detect and respond to attacks that leverage `Instantiator`.
    *   **Investigation:** Facilitates post-incident analysis.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   General application logging exists, but no specific tracking of `Instantiator` calls.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Specific logging for each `$instantiator->instantiate()` call needs to be added.
