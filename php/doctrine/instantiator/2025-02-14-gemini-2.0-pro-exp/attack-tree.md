## Attack Tree Path: [1. Inject Malicious Class Name [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__inject_malicious_class_name__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a class name that the application doesn't expect, aiming to instantiate a class with malicious side effects (e.g., in its constructor, although Instantiator bypasses this, or in a `__wakeup` method if deserialization is involved). The attacker might target:
    *   A class within the application's codebase that performs sensitive operations when instantiated.
    *   A known vulnerable class from a third-party library included in the project.
    *   A class that, while not inherently malicious, can be manipulated to perform harmful actions based on its interaction with the application's environment.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   The attacker identifies an input field or parameter where the application accepts a class name.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious class name string.
    *   The attacker submits the malicious input.
    *   The application, lacking proper validation, passes the malicious class name to `Instantiator::instantiate()`.
    *   Instantiator instantiates the malicious class.
    *   The malicious class's code (potentially in `__wakeup` if deserialization is involved) executes, compromising the application.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if input is not properly validated)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (potential for arbitrary code execution)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:** The application *must* validate the class name against a strict whitelist of allowed classes.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize the input to ensure it conforms to expected class name formats.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's deserialization process (e.g., using `unserialize()`, JSON deserialization, or other methods) to inject a malicious object.  Even though Instantiator bypasses constructors, the `__wakeup()` method (or other magic methods) of the injected object can be used to execute arbitrary code. This is the *most dangerous* attack vector when Instantiator is used in conjunction with deserialization.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   The attacker identifies a point where the application deserializes data from an untrusted source.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload containing an object of a class with a `__wakeup()` method (or other exploitable magic method).
    *   The attacker sends the malicious payload to the application.
    *   The application deserializes the payload.
    *   Instantiator (potentially) is used to instantiate the deserialized object.
    *   The `__wakeup()` method of the malicious object executes, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if Instantiator is used with untrusted deserialized data)
*   **Impact:** Very High (potential for arbitrary code execution)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid Unsafe Deserialization:** *Never* deserialize data from untrusted sources.
    *   **Use Secure Deserialization Libraries:** If deserialization is necessary, use a secure library with whitelisting.
    *   **Input Validation (Before Deserialization):** Validate input *before* deserialization.
    *   **Audit `__wakeup()` Methods:** Carefully review any `__wakeup()` methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Supply Unexpected Arguments to `__wakeup` (if used) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/9__supply_unexpected_arguments_to____wakeup___if_used___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a direct consequence of a successful deserialization attack (node 3). If a class has a `__wakeup` method, and the attacker controls the serialized data, they can control the data passed to `__wakeup`. This allows them to manipulate the behavior of `__wakeup`, potentially triggering vulnerabilities or unexpected code execution.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   This attack relies on the success of attack vector 3 (Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities).
    *   The attacker crafts the serialized data to include specific values that will be passed to the `__wakeup` method.
    *   When the object is deserialized and instantiated, the `__wakeup` method receives the attacker-controlled data.
    *   The `__wakeup` method, potentially due to vulnerabilities or flawed logic, executes code based on the attacker-controlled data, leading to compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on the presence and vulnerability of `__wakeup` methods)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (potential for arbitrary code execution or data corruption)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
     *   **Validate `__wakeup` Input:** Carefully validate any data used within `__wakeup` methods.
     *   **Minimize `__wakeup` Logic:** Keep `__wakeup` methods as simple as possible. Avoid complex logic.
     *   All mitigations from attack vector 3 also apply here.
