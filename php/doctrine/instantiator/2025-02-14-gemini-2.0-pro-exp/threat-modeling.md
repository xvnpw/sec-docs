# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/instantiator

## Threat: [Threat 1: Bypassing Constructor Security Checks](./threats/threat_1_bypassing_constructor_security_checks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that causes the application to instantiate a class using `Instantiator::instantiate()` without calling its constructor.  The constructor of this class is *intended* to perform crucial security checks. These checks might include:
    *   Validating input parameters that are normally passed to the constructor.
    *   Initializing security-related properties to safe default values (e.g., setting an `isAdmin` flag to `false`, initializing a cryptographic key).
    *   Enforcing access control rules that are normally checked within the constructor.
    *   Setting up required dependencies or resources in a secure manner.

    By bypassing the constructor, the attacker avoids these intended security measures, leaving the object in an insecure or unpredictable state. The attacker does *not* necessarily need to control the class name directly; they might exploit existing application logic that uses Instantiator on a class that *should* have constructor checks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If the constructor sets default security roles or permissions (e.g., `isAdmin = false`), bypassing it could leave the object in an unintentionally privileged state.  The property might be `null`, `false` (in some loose comparison contexts), or even retain a value from a previous object in memory.
    *   **Data Corruption/Injection:** If the constructor validates input parameters to prevent injection vulnerabilities, bypassing it could allow an attacker to inject malicious data directly into object properties.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** If the constructor is responsible for securely initializing sensitive data (e.g., an encryption key), bypassing it could leave that data uninitialized, predictable, or accessible to the attacker.
    *   **Violation of Business Logic and Invariants:** The constructor often enforces critical business rules and ensures the object is in a consistent state. Bypassing it can lead to an inconsistent or invalid application state, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes.
*   **Affected Instantiator Component:** `Instantiator::instantiate()` (the core function of the library that bypasses the constructor).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Defensive Property Initialization:** Use type hints and default values for properties whenever possible.  This ensures properties have a safe default state *even if* the constructor is bypassed. Example: `private bool $isAdmin = false;`  This is a *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Lazy Initialization (for Critical Properties):** If a property *must* be initialized in a specific, secure way (e.g., with a cryptographically secure random value), use lazy initialization within getter methods.  This ensures the property is initialized only when it's actually accessed, *regardless* of whether the constructor was called.  This is crucial for sensitive data.
    *   **Post-Instantiation Validation (Defense-in-Depth):** *After* using `Instantiator::instantiate()`, use reflection (PHP's `ReflectionClass` and `ReflectionProperty`) to inspect the object's state and verify that critical properties have been initialized to expected, safe values.  This is a *secondary* mitigation, adding an extra layer of security. It adds overhead, so use it judiciously.
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Class Name Whitelisting):** If the class name to be instantiated comes from *any* form of user input (direct or indirect), *strictly validate* it against a pre-approved whitelist of allowed classes.  *Never* allow arbitrary class instantiation based on user-supplied data. This is crucial if user input influences the instantiation process.
    *   **Avoid Constructor-Only Security:** Do *not* rely *exclusively* on the constructor for security-critical operations. Design your classes to be secure *even if* the constructor is bypassed. This is a fundamental principle of secure design.
    * **Factory Methods with Validation:** If Instantiator is needed, encapsulate its use within factory methods. These factory methods can perform pre-instantiation validation of the class name and any necessary post-instantiation checks, ensuring a secure object creation process.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Exploiting Uninitialized State in Deserialization Contexts (Indirect, but Instantiator-Facilitated)](./threats/threat_2_exploiting_uninitialized_state_in_deserialization_contexts__indirect__but_instantiator-faci_d5d06d51.md)

*   **Description:** While the *primary* vulnerability here is unsafe deserialization, Instantiator *exacerbates* the risk. An attacker provides malicious serialized data. The application uses `unserialize()`.  If the application *then* uses `Instantiator::instantiate()` on the deserialized object (or a class specified within the serialized data), it bypasses the constructor, *compounding* the problem.  The attacker gains control over the object's state *and* avoids constructor-based security checks. This is a *high* risk because it combines two dangerous practices. The attacker is leveraging Instantiator to make an already bad situation (unsafe deserialization) much worse.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If combined with a class that has exploitable "magic methods" (`__wakeup`, `__destruct`, etc.), this can lead to RCE, even without the constructor being called.
    *   **Arbitrary Object Manipulation:** The attacker can create objects with arbitrary property values, leading to data corruption, logic errors, and potential privilege escalation.
    *   **All Impacts of Threat 1:** All the impacts of bypassing constructor security checks (Threat 1) are also present and amplified in this scenario.
*   **Affected Instantiator Component:** `Instantiator::instantiate()` (when used in conjunction with, or after, `unserialize()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Unsafe Deserialization:** The *primary* mitigation is to *never* deserialize data from untrusted sources. This is the most critical step.
    *   **Use Safe Alternatives to Deserialization:** Use safer data exchange formats like JSON (with `json_decode()` and strict schema validation) or Protocol Buffers. These are significantly less prone to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Strict Class Name Whitelisting (If Deserialization is Unavoidable):** If you *absolutely must* use `unserialize()`, implement a *very strict* whitelist of allowed classes that can be deserialized. This whitelist should be as restrictive as possible.
    *   **Avoid Magic Methods with Side Effects:** Be extremely cautious about using magic methods (especially `__wakeup` and `__destruct`) in classes that might be deserialized. These methods are frequent targets for exploitation. If you must use them, thoroughly sanitize any data used within these methods.
    *   **Combine with Mitigations from Threat 1:** All the mitigation strategies for Threat 1 (defensive property initialization, lazy initialization, post-instantiation validation) are *also* crucial in this scenario to minimize the impact of bypassing the constructor.
    * **Input Validation Before Deserialization:** Perform basic validation on the serialized data *before* passing it to `unserialize()`. Check for length, structure, or known malicious patterns. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
