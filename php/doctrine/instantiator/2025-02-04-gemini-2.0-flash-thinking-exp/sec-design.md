# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `doctrine/instantiator`, is a PHP library designed to instantiate classes without invoking their constructors. This is primarily useful in scenarios such as:

- Object-relational mappers (ORMs) needing to hydrate objects from databases without triggering constructor logic.
- Dependency injection containers needing to create instances without specific constructor arguments.
- Testing frameworks needing to create mock objects or instances for testing purposes without side effects from constructors.
- Deserialization processes where objects need to be created from serialized data structures.

The primary business priority this library addresses is to provide a utility for controlled object instantiation in PHP, enabling more flexible and efficient software development in the contexts mentioned above.

Key business risks associated with this project include:

- Risk of unexpected object states: Instantiating objects without constructors might bypass initialization logic, leading to objects in invalid or unexpected states if not handled carefully by the consuming application.
- Risk of dependency vulnerability: If this library contains vulnerabilities, applications depending on it could be affected. This is especially relevant if the library is used in critical business applications.
- Risk of misuse: Developers might misuse this library in contexts where constructor invocation is actually necessary, leading to application errors or unexpected behavior.
- Risk of supply chain compromise: If the library's distribution channel (e.g., Packagist) or build process is compromised, malicious code could be injected, affecting all applications that depend on it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for this project are primarily focused on standard open-source development practices:

- security control: Public code repository on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Use of GitHub Actions for continuous integration, potentially including basic static analysis or testing. Implemented: `.github/workflows` directory in the repository.
- security control: Distribution via Packagist, a widely used PHP package repository, which has its own security measures. Implemented: Packagist.

Accepted risks for this project, based on the information available, might include:

- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Limited dedicated security team actively monitoring and securing the project.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies used by the library itself (though it aims to be dependency-free).

Recommended security controls to enhance the security posture:

- recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to detect vulnerabilities in any development-time dependencies.
- recommended security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Consider code signing the released packages to ensure integrity and authenticity of the distributed library.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear security vulnerability reporting process to allow users to report potential issues responsibly.

Security requirements for this project:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable as this is a library. Authentication is relevant for the systems that *use* this library, but not the library itself.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable as this is a library. Authorization is relevant for the systems that *use* this library.
- Input Validation: Input validation is important. The library takes class names as input. While not directly user-provided input in most cases, validating that the input is a valid class name and handling potential errors gracefully is necessary to prevent unexpected behavior or potential abuse if class names are dynamically determined based on external factors.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for this library as it does not handle sensitive data directly. However, if code signing is implemented for distribution, cryptographic keys and processes will be involved.

## DEPLOYMENT

The `doctrine/instantiator` library itself is not "deployed" in the traditional sense of applications. It's distributed as a package and then integrated into other PHP applications. Therefore, the deployment context is primarily about how applications that *use* this library are deployed.

For applications using `doctrine/instantiator`, typical PHP deployment environments include:

- **Shared Hosting:**  Less common for modern applications, but still exists. Deployment usually involves uploading files via FTP or control panels.
- **Virtual Private Servers (VPS):** More control than shared hosting. Deployment often involves manual server configuration and file transfer (e.g., using SSH and rsync).
- **Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure):** Highly scalable and automated. Deployment can use various services like EC2, Compute Engine, Azure VMs, container services (ECS, GKE, AKS), and serverless functions.
- **Containerized Environments (Docker, Kubernetes):** Increasingly popular for modern applications. Deployment involves building Docker images and orchestrating containers using Kubernetes or similar platforms.

Let's focus on a **Containerized Environment (Kubernetes)** deployment as a representative modern approach.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect indirectly are the functionalities of PHP applications that rely on `doctrine/instantiator`. If the library is compromised or has vulnerabilities, it could impact the integrity and security of these applications. Directly, we are protecting the integrity and availability of the `doctrine/instantiator` library itself, ensuring it remains a trustworthy component for the PHP ecosystem.

Data we are trying to protect:

- Source code of `doctrine/instantiator`: Sensitivity - Public, but integrity is crucial. Modification by unauthorized parties or injection of malicious code would be a high-impact security incident.
- Build artifacts (packages): Sensitivity - Public, but integrity is crucial. Compromised packages distributed to users would have a high impact.
- Secrets used in the build process (e.g., Packagist API keys): Sensitivity - Confidential. Exposure could allow unauthorized package releases.

Sensitivity levels:

- Source code: Publicly available, but integrity is critical.
- Build artifacts: Publicly distributed, but integrity is critical.
- Secrets: Confidential, high sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the intended scope of security for this design document? Is it primarily focused on the library itself, or also on the applications that consume it? (Assumption: Primarily focused on the library and its build/distribution, with considerations for consumers).
- Are there any specific compliance requirements or security standards that the `doctrine/instantiator` project needs to adhere to? (Assumption: No specific compliance requirements beyond general good security practices for open-source projects).
- What is the expected threat model for this library? Who are the potential adversaries and what are their motivations? (Assumption: Potential adversaries could be malicious actors attempting to inject vulnerabilities into the library for supply chain attacks, or opportunistic attackers exploiting existing vulnerabilities).
- Is there a dedicated security team or point of contact for security-related issues for this project? (Assumption: Likely relies on community contributions and maintainers for security).

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a utility library for PHP developers. The main business risk is related to supply chain security and potential misuse of the library.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security posture relies on standard open-source practices. Recommended security controls are focused on enhancing automated security checks and distribution integrity.
- DESIGN: The library is distributed as a Composer package. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions. Deployment context is primarily about applications that use the library, with a focus on containerized deployments as a modern example.
