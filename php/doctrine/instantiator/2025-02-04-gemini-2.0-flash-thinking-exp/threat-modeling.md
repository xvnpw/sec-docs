# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/instantiator

## Threat: [Threat 1: Constructor Bypass for Security Checks](./threats/threat_1_constructor_bypass_for_security_checks.md)

*   **Threat:** Bypassing Security Checks in Constructors
*   **Description:** An attacker can utilize `doctrine/instantiator` to instantiate objects without executing their constructors. If constructors are designed to enforce security measures such as authorization, input validation, or initialization of security-critical properties, an attacker can circumvent these checks by directly using the `Instantiator::instantiate()` method. This bypasses the intended security logic embedded within the constructor.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected functionalities, privilege escalation, and the creation of objects with invalid or malicious data. This can lead to significant security breaches, data compromise, and unauthorized actions within the application.
*   **Affected Component:** `Instantiator::instantiate()` function, which is the core mechanism for constructor bypass provided by the library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate reliance on constructors for critical security checks.**  Shift security enforcement to other layers of the application architecture, such as dedicated security services, access control mechanisms, or input validation routines implemented outside of constructors.
    *   **Design classes to be secure even when constructors are bypassed.** Implement robust security measures that are not dependent on constructor execution. This could involve using factory methods with built-in security checks, employing setters with validation logic, or ensuring security checks are performed within business logic methods invoked after object instantiation.
    *   **Restrict the usage of `doctrine/instantiator` in security-sensitive contexts.** Carefully evaluate each use case of `doctrine/instantiator` and avoid employing it in scenarios where constructor logic is essential for maintaining application security. If constructor bypass is not strictly necessary, consider alternative object creation methods.
    *   **Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews** specifically focusing on the usage of `doctrine/instantiator` to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities arising from constructor bypass in security-critical areas of the application.
