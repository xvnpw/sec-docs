* **Attack Surface: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific input string that causes the regular expressions used internally by the Inflector to enter a state of excessive backtracking, leading to high CPU consumption and potential denial of service.
    * **How Inflector Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The library relies on regular expressions for its core functionality of pluralizing, singularizing, and transforming strings. Inefficient or complex regular expressions can be vulnerable to ReDoS.
    * **Example:**  Providing an extremely long, repetitive string like "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" to a pluralization or singularization function might trigger a ReDoS if the underlying regex is not optimized.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, potentially crashing the server or consuming significant resources, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation to limit the length and complexity of strings passed to the Inflector.
        * **Timeouts:**  Implement timeouts on the Inflector functions to prevent them from running indefinitely.
        * **Review and Optimize Regex:**  If possible, review the internal regular expressions of the Inflector (or consider forking and modifying if necessary) to identify and optimize potentially problematic patterns.
        * **Consider Alternative Libraries:** If ReDoS is a significant concern and the application's inflection needs are simple, consider using a less complex library or a custom implementation.

* **Attack Surface: Logic Errors Leading to Security Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:**  Incorrect or unexpected output from the Inflector, while not a direct code execution vulnerability, can lead to flaws in application logic that have security implications.
    * **How Inflector Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the inflected output is used in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., generating database table names, file paths, API endpoint segments) without proper validation, incorrect inflection could lead to unintended access or modification of resources.
    * **Example:** An attacker manipulates input intended for pluralization (e.g., "user") in a way that, due to a flaw in the inflection logic, incorrectly generates a singular form that corresponds to a sensitive resource name (e.g., "admin"). If this generated string is used to construct a database query or file path without further validation, it could lead to unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion depending on how the inflected output is used within the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Careful Usage in Security Contexts:** Avoid directly using the output of the Inflector in critical security contexts without further validation and sanitization.
        * **Output Validation:**  Validate the output of the Inflector against expected values or patterns before using it in security-sensitive operations.
        * **Unit Testing:** Implement thorough unit tests that specifically cover edge cases and potentially problematic inputs to ensure the Inflector behaves as expected in all scenarios.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application components using the inflected output operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential logic errors.
