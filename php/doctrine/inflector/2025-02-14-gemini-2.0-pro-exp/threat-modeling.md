# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/inflector

## Threat: [Unexpected Pluralization/Singularization Leading to Resource Misidentification](./threats/unexpected_pluralizationsingularization_leading_to_resource_misidentification.md)

*   **Threat:** Unexpected Pluralization/Singularization Leading to Resource Misidentification

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted input string to a function utilizing the inflector. Due to a bug, edge case, or unexpected behavior within the *inflector itself*, an incorrect plural or singular form is generated. This incorrect form is then used to access a resource (database table, file, API endpoint). The vulnerability lies in the *inflector's incorrect transformation*, not in how the application *uses* the result (that would be an indirect threat).
    *   **Impact:** The application accesses the wrong resource, potentially leading to data leakage, data corruption, or denial of service. The attacker might gain unauthorized access or disrupt functionality *because of the inflector's error*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Inflector::pluralize()`, `Inflector::singularize()`, and any custom rules added to the inflector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test the inflector with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases, unusual words, and potentially malicious strings *designed to expose inflector bugs*.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `doctrine/inflector` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes.
        *   **Input Validation (Pre-Inflector):** While the core issue is the inflector, validating input *before* it reaches the inflector can limit the attack surface. Focus on character sets and expected patterns.
        *    **Contextual Validation (Post-Inflector):** Although the threat is the inflector's incorrect output, validating *that output* in its usage context (e.g., checking if a generated table name exists) adds a layer of defense.

## Threat: [Tampering with the Inflector Library](./threats/tampering_with_the_inflector_library.md)

*   **Threat:**  Tampering with the Inflector Library

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the server and *directly modifies the `doctrine/inflector` library files*. This is a direct attack on the inflector itself. The modified library now produces altered or malicious results, *regardless of the input*.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can deliberately manipulate the inflector's output to achieve specific malicious goals, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The impact is broad because *any* use of the inflector is now compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The entire `doctrine/inflector` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management with Integrity Checks:** Use Composer with `composer.lock` to ensure the integrity of installed dependencies. This helps detect *unauthorized* modifications.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM to detect *any* changes to critical files, including the inflector library. This is crucial.
        *   **Server Security:**  Implement strong server security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, access controls) to prevent unauthorized access and modification of files. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities, including potential weaknesses that could allow file tampering.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Complex Input Exploiting Inflector Bug](./threats/denial_of_service_via_complex_input_exploiting_inflector_bug.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service via Complex Input Exploiting Inflector Bug

    * **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely long or complex input string specifically crafted to exploit a *bug or algorithmic inefficiency within the inflector itself*. This is distinct from a general DoS; the vulnerability must reside *within the inflector's code*. The inflector consumes excessive resources, leading to DoS.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it. The attack succeeds *because of a flaw in the inflector*.
    * **Affected Component:** All inflector methods (`Inflector::pluralize()`, `Inflector::singularize()`, etc.), depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (assuming a significant, exploitable bug exists).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep the library updated to the latest version, as this is the most likely way a DoS-causing bug would be fixed.
        * **Performance Testing (Targeted):** Conduct performance testing specifically targeting the inflector with a variety of complex and unusual inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities *before* they are exploited.
        * **Input Length Limits (Pre-Inflector):** While the core issue is an inflector bug, limiting input length *before* calling the inflector reduces the attack surface.
        * **Resource Limits (System-Level):** Set resource limits (memory, CPU time) for PHP processes. This is a general mitigation, but it helps contain the impact of a successful DoS.
