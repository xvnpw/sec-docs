# Attack Surface Analysis for doctrine/inflector

## Attack Surface: [Security Mechanism Bypass (Due to Direct Output Use)](./attack_surfaces/security_mechanism_bypass__due_to_direct_output_use_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input *specifically crafted for Inflector functions* to bypass security checks that *incorrectly and directly* rely on `Inflector`'s output (e.g., authorization based on class names generated by `Inflector`, routing based on slugs generated by `Inflector`). This is a *direct* attack because the vulnerability stems from the application's reliance on the *unvalidated output of Inflector itself* in security logic.
*   **How Inflector Contributes:** The application *directly* uses the output of `Inflector` functions (like `classify`, `tableize`, `slug`) within security-critical logic (authorization, routing, data access control) *without* proper validation or indirection. This makes the security mechanism dependent on the predictable, but manipulable, transformations of `Inflector`.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Authorization Bypass:** An application checks user permissions based on `Inflector::classify($controllerName)`. An attacker provides a carefully chosen `$controllerName` (e.g., "AdminPanel" instead of "UserPanel") that, *when processed by Inflector*, results in a class name that grants unauthorized access. The attack works because the security check directly uses the `Inflector::classify` output.
    *   **Routing Bypass:** An application uses `Inflector::tableize($resourceName)` to determine the database table to query. An attacker provides a `$resourceName` (e.g., "users; DROP TABLE users --") that, *when processed by Inflector*, might be concatenated directly into a SQL query, leading to SQL injection.  (This highlights the *combination* of direct use and lack of output sanitization).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Indirection is Key:** *Never* use `Inflector` output *directly* in security checks. Instead, use `Inflector` to generate a *key* or *identifier*. This key should then be looked up in a *separate, secure, and controlled* data structure (e.g., a permission map, a routing table, an ACL). The security decision should be based on this lookup, *not* on the raw `Inflector` output.
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Pre-Inflector):** Rigorous input validation *before* data reaches `Inflector` is crucial. Define strict rules for the allowed format, length, and character set of the input. This limits the attacker's ability to control the output of `Inflector`.
    *   **Output Validation/Sanitization (Post-Inflector):** Even after using `Inflector` to generate a key, *validate* that key against a whitelist or other secure mechanism *before* using it in any security-related operation. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that users and application components have only the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the damage from a successful bypass.
    * **Example of Correct Usage:**
        ```php
        // BAD (Vulnerable):
        $className = Inflector::classify($userInput);
        if (class_exists($className) && userHasAccessToClass($className)) { ... }

        // GOOD (More Secure):
        $resourceKey = Inflector::classify($userInput); // Use Inflector for key generation
        if (isset($allowedResources[$resourceKey]) && userHasAccessToResource($resourceKey)) { ... }
        // $allowedResources is a predefined, secure array mapping keys to resources.
        ```
