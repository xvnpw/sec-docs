# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/inflector

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input strings specifically designed to exploit vulnerable regular expressions within the inflector library. By providing these inputs to inflector functions (e.g., `Inflector::pluralize()`, `Inflector::singularize()`), the attacker can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of excessive backtracking. This leads to high CPU consumption and potentially freezes the application, resulting in a denial of service for legitimate users. The attacker might repeatedly send these malicious requests to amplify the impact.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, server resource exhaustion, potential impact on other applications sharing the same server, financial loss due to downtime, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Regular expressions used within various inflector functions, particularly in pluralization and singularization rules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Sanitize and validate all user-supplied input before passing it to inflector functions. Implement restrictions on input length and allowed characters.
    *   Regular Expression Review and Testing:  While not directly modifiable, understand the regex patterns used by `doctrine/inflector`.  Test with various inputs, including potentially malicious ones, to identify performance bottlenecks. Consider using static analysis tools for ReDoS detection.
    *   Dependency Updates: Keep `doctrine/inflector` updated to the latest version to benefit from potential security fixes and performance improvements in regular expressions.
    *   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or application features that utilize inflector and are exposed to public input.
    *   Resource Monitoring: Monitor server CPU and memory usage to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.
    *   Consider alternative inflector libraries or methods if ReDoS risk is deemed too high and cannot be adequately mitigated.
