## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application via Inflector Exploitation [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_via_inflector_exploitation__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. The attacker aims to leverage vulnerabilities related to Doctrine Inflector to compromise the application.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   This is the starting point of all high-risk attack paths.
    *   Success at this root level means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through Inflector-related weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerable Logic Path [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerable_logic_path__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting logic bugs within Inflector or, more likely, the application's usage of Inflector to reach a vulnerable code path.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   This step requires the attacker to identify a flaw (either in Inflector's logic or in how the application uses it).
    *   The attacker then crafts input or manipulates the application's state to trigger this flaw.
    *   This path is critical because it moves from identifying potential weaknesses to actively exploiting them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application uses Inflector output in security-sensitive context [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/application_uses_inflector_output_in_security-sensitive_context__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This highlights a critical application design flaw. Using Inflector's output in security-sensitive operations without proper sanitization or validation creates a vulnerability.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   This is not an attack step by the attacker, but rather a description of a vulnerable application characteristic.
    *   It's a *critical node* because it's the prerequisite for the most dangerous exploitation paths.
    *   Common security-sensitive contexts include:
        *   Constructing SQL queries.
        *   Building file paths for file system operations.
        *   Dynamically resolving class or function names.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Query Construction [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_query_construction__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Using the inflected names directly or indirectly to build SQL queries, creating a potential SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   This is a specific instance of the "security-sensitive context" node, focusing on SQL.
    *   If the application uses inflected names (e.g., table names, column names) derived from user input or external data and incorporates them directly into SQL queries, it's highly vulnerable.
    *   This path is high-risk because SQL injection is a well-known and highly impactful vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious SQL fragments via inflected names [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_fragments_via_inflected_names__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting inputs that, when processed by Inflector and used in SQL query construction, result in the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   This is the final exploitation step in the highest-risk path.
    *   The attacker manipulates input to influence the inflected name.
    *   This manipulated inflected name is then used in a vulnerable SQL query construction, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   Successful SQL injection can lead to:
        *   Data exfiltration (stealing sensitive data).
        *   Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
        *   Privilege escalation (gaining administrative access).
        *   Complete database compromise and potentially server compromise.
