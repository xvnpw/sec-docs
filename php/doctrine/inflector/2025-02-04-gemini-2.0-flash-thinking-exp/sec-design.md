# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a PHP library called "inflector". It is designed to perform word inflection tasks, such as singularizing and pluralizing words. Libraries like this are commonly used in software development to improve code readability and maintainability by automating string manipulations related to language conventions.

* Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a reliable and efficient library for PHP developers to handle word inflection.
  - Simplify development processes by abstracting away complex inflection rules.
  - Ensure compatibility and ease of integration with various PHP projects and frameworks.
  - Maintain the library as an open-source project, fostering community contribution and adoption.

* Business Risks:
  - Dependency Risk: Projects relying on this library become dependent on its continued maintenance and security.
  - Code Quality Risk: Bugs or inefficiencies in the library can negatively impact the performance and correctness of applications using it.
  - Security Vulnerability Risk: Although less likely for a utility library, vulnerabilities could be introduced, potentially affecting applications that use it.
  - Adoption Risk: Lack of adoption by the PHP developer community would limit the library's impact and value.

# SECURITY POSTURE

* Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Review - Implemented through GitHub Pull Requests, ensuring that changes are reviewed by maintainers before being merged. (Implemented in: GitHub repository - Pull Request process)
  - security control: Unit Testing -  The project includes unit tests to verify the functionality and correctness of the inflection logic. (Implemented in: `tests/`)
  - security control: Static Analysis - Potentially implemented through linters and static analysis tools integrated into the development workflow, although not explicitly mentioned in the repository. (Potentially implemented in: Development environment and/or CI pipeline)
  - security control: Open Source - The project is open source, allowing for community scrutiny and contribution to identify and fix potential security issues. (Implemented in: GitHub repository - public visibility)

* Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions - As an open-source project, security vulnerability discovery and patching may rely on community contributions rather than dedicated security teams.
  - accepted risk: Limited Formal Security Audits -  For smaller, utility libraries, formal security audits might not be regularly conducted due to resource constraints.

* Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used during development or testing.
  - security control: Automated SAST (Static Application Security Testing) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code during the build process.
  - security control: Vulnerability Reporting Process - Establish a clear process for reporting security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.

* Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. This is a library and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. This is a library and does not handle user authorization.
  - Input Validation: The library should implement robust input validation to handle unexpected or malicious input strings gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities. This should be implemented within the library's code, specifically in functions that process input strings.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. This library does not handle sensitive data or require cryptographic operations.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment for a PHP library is primarily about publishing it to a package manager. There isn't a traditional "deployment architecture" in the same way as for a web application. The library is deployed to package repositories, from where developers can download and include it in their projects.

We will describe deployment to Packagist, the primary PHP package repository.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and Maintenance of the Inflector Library: Ensuring the library remains functional, secure, and up-to-date.
  - Usage of the Inflector Library in PHP Projects: Ensuring that projects using the library are not negatively impacted by vulnerabilities or bugs in the library.

* Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source Code: Publicly available, but integrity is important to prevent malicious modifications. Sensitivity: Low to Medium (Integrity is key).
  - Build Artifacts (Packages): Publicly available, but integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks. Sensitivity: Medium (Integrity and Availability are key).
  - Development Environment and Infrastructure: Access credentials, CI/CD configurations. Sensitivity: Medium to High (Confidentiality and Integrity are key to prevent unauthorized modifications and releases).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

* Questions:
  - Are there specific performance requirements for the Inflector library?
  - Are there any known vulnerabilities or past security incidents related to this library or similar libraries?
  - What is the expected lifespan and maintenance plan for this library?
  - Are there specific coding standards or security guidelines followed during development?

* Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a useful and reliable open-source library for the PHP community. The business risk appetite is moderate, prioritizing community trust and code quality.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source security practices are followed, including code review and unit testing. Security is important but not the absolute highest priority compared to functionality and usability for a utility library of this nature. The project relies on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - DESIGN: The library is designed as a standalone component with clear API boundaries. Deployment is primarily through package managers like Packagist. The build process is automated using CI/CD practices.
