# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/inflector

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious input string that, when processed by the inflector's regular expressions, causes excessive backtracking and consumes significant CPU resources. The attacker might repeatedly send such crafted inputs to overwhelm the server, leading to a denial of service. This directly exploits the regular expression processing within the inflector library.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability for legitimate users. Server resources are exhausted, potentially affecting other applications on the same server.

**Affected Component:** Regular expressions used within the inflection methods (e.g., within `Inflector::pluralize()`, `Inflector::singularize()`, `Inflector::camelize()`, `Inflector::tableize()`, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and optimize the regular expressions used within the Doctrine Inflector library to prevent catastrophic backtracking.
*   Implement timeouts for inflector operations to limit the processing time for any single request.
*   Sanitize or validate input strings before passing them to the inflector to reject potentially malicious patterns known to trigger ReDoS.
*   Consider using alternative, more performant and secure, string manipulation techniques where regular expressions are not strictly necessary within the application's use of the inflector.
*   Monitor server resource usage for unusual spikes that might indicate a ReDoS attack targeting the inflector.
