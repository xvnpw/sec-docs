# Attack Surface Analysis for doctrine/inflector

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:**  A denial-of-service vulnerability where a specially crafted input string causes the regular expression engine used by the inflector to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, consuming excessive CPU resources and potentially crashing the application.
    *   **How Inflector Contributes:** The library likely uses regular expressions internally for its string manipulation logic (e.g., identifying word endings, applying pluralization rules). If these regex patterns are not carefully designed, they can be susceptible to ReDoS attacks when provided with malicious input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a very long string with a repeating pattern that triggers exponential backtracking in one of the inflector's internal regular expressions, such as `singularize()` being called with "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".
    *   **Impact:** High CPU usage, application slowdown, potential application crash, denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review and Optimize Regular Expressions:**  Developers should analyze the inflector's source code (or any custom regexes used in conjunction with it) to identify and refactor potentially vulnerable regular expressions.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Limit the length of input strings passed to the inflector. Sanitize input to remove or escape potentially problematic characters before passing them to the library.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for inflector operations to prevent them from running indefinitely.
        *   **Consider Alternative Libraries:** If ReDoS vulnerabilities are a significant concern and the inflector's regex patterns are problematic, consider using alternative string manipulation libraries with more robust regex implementations or different approaches.
