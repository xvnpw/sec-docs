# Threat Model Analysis for doctrine/inflector

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specific input string that, when processed by the inflector's internal regular expressions, causes excessive backtracking and consumes significant CPU resources. This can lead to a denial of service, making the application unresponsive. The attacker might repeatedly send such crafted inputs to amplify the effect.

*   **Impact:**  Application becomes slow or completely unavailable, impacting legitimate users. Server resources are exhausted, potentially affecting other applications on the same server.

*   **Affected Component:**  Internal regular expression engine used within various inflection functions (e.g., `pluralize`, `singularize`, `camelize`, `underscore`).

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement timeouts for inflector function calls to prevent indefinite processing.
    *   Sanitize or validate user inputs before passing them to inflector functions to prevent potentially malicious patterns.
    *   Monitor server resource usage for unusual spikes when using inflector functions with user-provided input.
    *   Consider using alternative inflection libraries or custom logic if ReDoS is a significant concern and the built-in protections are insufficient.
    *   Keep the `doctrine/inflector` library updated to benefit from any potential bug fixes or performance improvements related to regular expressions.
