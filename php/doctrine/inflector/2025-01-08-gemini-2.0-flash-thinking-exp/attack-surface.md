# Attack Surface Analysis for doctrine/inflector

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized output from the Inflector used in security-sensitive contexts, leading to injection vulnerabilities.](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_output_from_the_inflector_used_in_security-sensitive_contexts__leading_to_injection_vuln_f0e48785.md)

*   **How Inflector Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The Inflector transforms strings, and the output of these transformations (e.g., generated class names, table names) might be directly used in dynamic code execution, database queries, or other security-sensitive operations. If the input to the Inflector is not properly sanitized *before* inflection, the output could contain malicious characters.
*   **Example:** An attacker could influence the input to the `camelize()` function to generate a class name containing malicious code, which is then used in a dynamic class instantiation, leading to code injection. Alternatively, an inflected string used directly in an SQL query without parameterization could lead to SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Code Injection, SQL Injection, other injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the context of use)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Treat Inflector output as untrusted data.**  Always sanitize or escape the output of the Inflector based on the context where it will be used.
    *   **For SQL queries:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Do not directly concatenate inflected strings into SQL.
    *   **For dynamic code execution:** Carefully validate and restrict the possible output of the Inflector before using it to determine class names or other executable code elements. Consider whitelisting allowed outputs.
    *   **For output to web pages:** Apply appropriate output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Attack Surface: [Malicious custom inflection rules leading to unexpected transformations or application logic errors.](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_inflection_rules_leading_to_unexpected_transformations_or_application_logic_errors.md)

*   **How Inflector Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the application allows users or external configurations to define custom inflection rules, a malicious actor could inject rules that cause incorrect or harmful transformations.
*   **Example:** An attacker could define a custom rule that incorrectly singularizes or pluralizes specific terms, leading to errors in data retrieval or processing.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application logic errors, potential for further exploitation depending on the context.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the impact of incorrect transformations)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict the ability to define custom inflection rules** to trusted sources only.
    *   **Implement strict validation and sanitization** of custom inflection rules before they are applied.
    *   **Regularly review and audit** any custom inflection rules that are in use.
