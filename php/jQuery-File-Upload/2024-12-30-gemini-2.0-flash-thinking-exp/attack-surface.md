### Key Attack Surface List: jQuery-File-Upload (High & Critical, Direct Involvement)

Here's a filtered list of key attack surfaces that directly involve the `jQuery-File-Upload` library, focusing on high and critical risk severities.

*   **Description:** Filename Manipulation leading to Path Traversal
    *   **How jQuery-File-Upload Contributes:** The library handles the selection and transmission of filenames to the server. This provides the attacker with the input vector for manipulating the filename.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the file selection dialog provided by the library to choose a file, but the filename transmitted to the server is modified (e.g., via browser developer tools or a proxy) to include `../../../../evil.php`.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical system files or placing malicious scripts in web-accessible directories for remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict server-side filename sanitization **after** receiving the filename from the `jQuery-File-Upload` component. Remove or replace characters like `../`, `./`, absolute paths, and other potentially dangerous sequences. Consider generating unique, server-controlled filenames and disregarding the client-provided name for critical operations.

*   **Description:** Content-Type Spoofing
    *   **How jQuery-File-Upload Contributes:** The library transmits the `Content-Type` header provided by the browser. Attackers can potentially manipulate this header before or during the upload process facilitated by the library.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the library's upload functionality but intercepts the request and modifies the `Content-Type` header to `image/jpeg` for a malicious PHP script.
    *   **Impact:** Can bypass basic server-side file type checks that rely solely on the `Content-Type` header, potentially leading to the execution of malicious scripts or other unintended consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** **Never rely solely on the `Content-Type` header** transmitted by the `jQuery-File-Upload` library. Implement robust server-side file type validation by inspecting the file's content (magic numbers or file signatures).

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Uploaded Filenames
    *   **How jQuery-File-Upload Contributes:** The library is often used to display lists of uploaded files, including their filenames. If the application doesn't sanitize these filenames received via the library's upload process, it creates an XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a file named `<script>alert("XSS")</script>.txt` using the library. If the application then displays this filename without encoding in a file list, the script will execute in the browsers of other users viewing the list.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially stealing user credentials, session tokens, or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement proper output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) when displaying uploaded filenames that were received and are being managed through the `jQuery-File-Upload` library.

*   **Description:** Server-Side Processing Vulnerabilities of Uploaded Files
    *   **How jQuery-File-Upload Contributes:** The library initiates the file upload process, making it the entry point for potentially malicious files to reach the server. While the library itself doesn't process the files, it's the mechanism through which vulnerable server-side processing can be triggered.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the library to upload a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image processing library used on the server, leading to remote code execution. The `jQuery-File-Upload` facilitated the delivery of this malicious file.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and other severe security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure server-side file processing for all files uploaded via `jQuery-File-Upload`. This includes:
            *   Scanning uploaded files for malware.
            *   Using secure and up-to-date libraries for file processing.
            *   Sandboxing or isolating file processing tasks.
            *   Avoiding direct execution of uploaded files.
