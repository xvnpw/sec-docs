## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Feed Content](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_feed_content.md)

**Description:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into RSS feed content (title, description, content fields). When a user views this feed in FreshRSS, the JavaScript executes in their browser.

**Likelihood:** Medium

**Impact:** High (Session hijacking, data theft, account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, further attacks on the user's system).

**Effort:** Low (Relatively easy to craft malicious JavaScript and embed it in an RSS feed).

**Skill Level:** Low (Script Kiddie)

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), Content Security Policy (CSP), and code review, but may be missed if encoding is insufficient or bypasses exist).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict output encoding (escaping) for all feed content before rendering it in the browser. Use context-aware encoding appropriate for HTML.
* Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit JavaScript execution sources and restrict inline JavaScript.
* Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User Input](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user_input.md)

**Description:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user input fields within FreshRSS (e.g., search queries, settings fields, if any user-facing input exists beyond feed URLs). When another user (or the same user later) views this input, the JavaScript executes in their browser.

**Likelihood:** Medium

**Impact:** High (Same as XSS via Feed Content: Session hijacking, data theft, account takeover, etc.).

**Effort:** Low (Similar to XSS via Feed Content, crafting malicious JavaScript is relatively easy).

**Skill Level:** Low (Script Kiddie)

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Similar to XSS via Feed Content, detection methods are similar).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all user-provided input.
* Implement strict output encoding (escaping) for user input before rendering it in the browser.
* Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.
* Perform regular security testing and code reviews to identify and fix XSS vulnerabilities in user input handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Hijacking via Insecure Session Cookie Handling](./attack_tree_paths/session_hijacking_via_insecure_session_cookie_handling.md)

**Description:** If FreshRSS is deployed over HTTP (instead of HTTPS) or if session cookies are not configured with the `Secure` flag, an attacker can intercept session cookies transmitted over the network (e.g., via network sniffing on a shared network).

**Likelihood:** Medium (If HTTP is used or `Secure` flag is missing, network sniffing is a viable attack).

**Impact:** High (Account takeover, attacker can impersonate a legitimate user and access their FreshRSS account and data).

**Effort:** Low (Easy to sniff network traffic on unencrypted networks using readily available tools).

**Skill Level:** Low (Script Kiddie)

**Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Use HTTPS for all communication, enforce the `Secure` flag on session cookies, monitor for HTTP traffic to the FreshRSS application).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS:**  Deploy FreshRSS exclusively over HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the user's browser and the server.
* **Set Secure Flag:** Configure FreshRSS to set the `Secure` flag on session cookies, ensuring they are only transmitted over HTTPS connections.
* **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Implement HSTS to force browsers to always use HTTPS for the FreshRSS domain.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Outdated Libraries with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_outdated_libraries_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** FreshRSS, like many web applications, relies on third-party libraries and dependencies. If these libraries are outdated and contain known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the FreshRSS application.

**Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies frequently have vulnerabilities, and if not regularly updated, FreshRSS can become vulnerable).

**Impact:** Varies (Can range from Denial of Service (DoS) and Information Disclosure to Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the specific vulnerability in the outdated library).

**Effort:** Medium (Requires identifying outdated libraries, researching known vulnerabilities, and potentially developing or finding exploits).

**Skill Level:** Medium (Competent Hacker) to High (Expert for complex exploits).

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Vulnerability scanners can detect outdated libraries, but exploit detection depends on the nature of the vulnerability and exploit techniques).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan FreshRSS dependencies for known vulnerabilities using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools or vulnerability scanners.
* **Dependency Updates:** Keep all FreshRSS dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and stable versions. Implement a regular patching process.
* **Automated Dependency Management:** Utilize dependency management tools to streamline the process of updating and managing dependencies.
* **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to the libraries used by FreshRSS to proactively address newly discovered vulnerabilities.
