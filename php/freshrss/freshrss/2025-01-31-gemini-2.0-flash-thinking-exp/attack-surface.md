# Attack Surface Analysis for freshrss/freshrss

## Attack Surface: [1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/1__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the FreshRSS server to make requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or external services, by manipulating user-supplied feed URLs.
*   **FreshRSS Contribution:** FreshRSS's core functionality is fetching and processing RSS/Atom feeds from user-provided URLs. This inherently involves making outbound HTTP requests based on user input. Insufficient validation in FreshRSS directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker adds a feed with the URL `http://internal.network/admin` as a feed source. FreshRSS server attempts to access this internal resource, potentially revealing sensitive information about the internal network or allowing interaction with internal services.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, information disclosure about internal infrastructure, potential interaction with internal services leading to further exploitation, denial of service against internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict URL validation and sanitization specifically within FreshRSS's feed fetching logic. Use allowlists of allowed protocols (e.g., `http`, `https`) and rigorously block access to private IP ranges and localhost.
        *   Utilize a robust URL parsing and validation library within FreshRSS to prevent bypasses.
        *   Consider implementing a proxy or intermediary service for feed fetching to further isolate FreshRSS server from direct external network interaction.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Feed Content](./attack_surfaces/2__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_feed_content.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other FreshRSS users. This is achieved by embedding malicious scripts within the content of RSS/Atom feeds that FreshRSS processes and displays.
*   **FreshRSS Contribution:** FreshRSS's feed parsing and display mechanism is the direct conduit for this vulnerability. If FreshRSS does not properly sanitize feed content before rendering it in the user interface, it becomes vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Example:** A malicious feed contains an article with content like: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS!')">`. When a user views this feed in FreshRSS, the JavaScript code `alert('XSS!')` executes in their browser. More sophisticated scripts could steal session cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, or deface the FreshRSS interface.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking of FreshRSS users, defacement of the FreshRSS interface, redirection to malicious websites, theft of sensitive information displayed within FreshRSS.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust and context-aware HTML sanitization specifically for feed content within FreshRSS. Use a well-vetted, actively maintained HTML sanitization library integrated directly into FreshRSS's rendering pipeline.
        *   Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) headers *within FreshRSS* to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources when displaying feed content, significantly reducing the impact of XSS.
        *   Ensure output encoding is consistently applied when displaying dynamic content from feeds within FreshRSS to prevent browser interpretation of malicious HTML and JavaScript.

## Attack Surface: [3. SQL Injection (SQLi)](./attack_surfaces/3__sql_injection__sqli_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries executed by FreshRSS, allowing them to manipulate the FreshRSS database.
*   **FreshRSS Contribution:** FreshRSS relies on a database to store all its data (feeds, articles, user settings, etc.). If FreshRSS's codebase constructs SQL queries using unsanitized user input, it becomes directly vulnerable to SQL injection. This could occur in search features, filtering mechanisms, or any area where user input influences database queries within FreshRSS.
*   **Example:**  In a vulnerable search feature within FreshRSS, an attacker inputs a search term like `' OR '1'='1 --`. If FreshRSS doesn't use parameterized queries, this input could modify the intended SQL query to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data from the FreshRSS database.
*   **Impact:** Complete data breach of the FreshRSS database (including user credentials, feed data, personal information), data modification or deletion within FreshRSS, potential authentication bypass allowing unauthorized administrative access to FreshRSS, denial of service by corrupting the database.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Mandatory use of parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all* database interactions within FreshRSS.** This is the most effective and essential defense against SQL injection and must be a core development practice for FreshRSS.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on *all* user-provided input that is used in database queries within FreshRSS, even when using parameterized queries as a secondary defense layer.
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege for database user accounts used by FreshRSS. The database user should only have the necessary permissions for FreshRSS to function, limiting the impact of a successful SQLi attack.
        *   Conduct regular and thorough code audits of FreshRSS specifically focused on identifying and eliminating potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automate vulnerability detection.

## Attack Surface: [4. Unrestricted File Upload (if enabled via extensions/customization)](./attack_surfaces/4__unrestricted_file_upload__if_enabled_via_extensionscustomization_.md)

*   **Description:** If FreshRSS, through extensions or custom modifications, allows file uploads without proper restrictions, attackers can upload malicious files that can compromise the FreshRSS server.
*   **FreshRSS Contribution:** While core FreshRSS might not inherently include file upload features, the extensibility of FreshRSS means that extensions or user customizations *can* introduce this functionality. If these extensions or customizations are not developed with security in mind, they directly introduce a file upload attack surface into the FreshRSS ecosystem.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as a theme file via a poorly secured theme upload extension for FreshRSS. If the web server executes PHP files in the theme upload directory, the attacker can access the web shell and gain remote code execution on the FreshRSS server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the FreshRSS server, full server compromise, defacement of the FreshRSS installation, data breach of the server's file system and potentially the FreshRSS database if the attacker pivots from server access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Extension Developers & Core if applicable):**
        *   **Minimize or completely avoid implementing file upload functionality in FreshRSS extensions unless absolutely essential.**  Thoroughly evaluate the security risks before introducing file uploads.
        *   If file upload is necessary, implement extremely strict file type validation using an allowlist approach within the extension. Only permit explicitly safe file types (e.g., for themes, only specific image and CSS file types).
        *   Sanitize uploaded filenames within the extension to rigorously prevent path traversal attacks.
        *   Store uploaded files *outside* of the web root directory of FreshRSS or in a designated upload directory where script execution is explicitly disabled at the web server level (e.g., using `.htaccess` or web server configuration).
        *   Implement virus scanning on all uploaded files within the extension using a reliable antivirus library or service.
        *   Enforce strict file size limits for uploads within the extension to mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks via large file uploads.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when installing FreshRSS extensions, especially those from untrusted sources or those that introduce file upload capabilities. Thoroughly review the extension's code and security implications before installation.
        *   Regularly audit installed FreshRSS extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or appear suspicious.
