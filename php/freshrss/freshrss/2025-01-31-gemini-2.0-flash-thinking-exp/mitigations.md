# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for freshrss/freshrss

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict RSS Feed URL Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_rss_feed_url_validation.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Implement URL parsing:** FreshRSS should use a robust URL parsing library to dissect provided RSS feed URLs.
2.  **Protocol Whitelisting:** FreshRSS should explicitly allow only `http://` and `https://` protocols, rejecting others like `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, etc.
3.  **Domain Validation (Optional):** FreshRSS could optionally implement a whitelist of allowed or trusted domain names for feed sources, configurable by administrators.
4.  **Input Sanitization:** FreshRSS should sanitize the URL string to remove potentially harmful characters before processing.
5.  **Error Handling:** FreshRSS should reject feed subscriptions with invalid URLs and display clear error messages to the user.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Severity):** Prevents FreshRSS from being manipulated to make requests to internal or unintended external resources.
*   **URL Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious URLs that could lead to phishing or other attacks.

**Impact:** High reduction in SSRF and URL Injection risks.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. FreshRSS likely performs basic URL validation, but protocol whitelisting and domain whitelisting might not be strictly enforced or configurable.

**Missing Implementation:**  Enhance FreshRSS URL validation to include strict protocol whitelisting and consider optional domain whitelisting. Make validation rules configurable for administrators within FreshRSS settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Validate RSS Feed Content](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_validate_rss_feed_content.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose a Robust HTML Sanitizer:** FreshRSS should integrate a well-vetted HTML sanitization library (e.g., HTMLPurifier for PHP).
2.  **Configure Sanitizer for Security:** FreshRSS should configure the sanitizer to remove or neutralize harmful HTML elements and attributes, including `<script>`, event handlers, and potentially dangerous tags.
3.  **Apply Sanitization to Feed Content:** FreshRSS must apply the HTML sanitizer to all relevant parts of RSS feed content before displaying it to users, including item descriptions, content, feed titles, and descriptions.
4.  **Validate other Feed Elements:** FreshRSS should validate and sanitize other feed elements beyond HTML content, like feed and item titles, and author information.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious scripts in RSS feeds from executing in users' browsers within FreshRSS.
*   **HTML Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary HTML to deface FreshRSS or mislead users.

**Impact:** High reduction in XSS and HTML Injection risks within FreshRSS.

**Currently Implemented:** Likely implemented. FreshRSS probably uses some form of HTML sanitization for feed content.

**Missing Implementation:**  Review and strengthen the HTML sanitization library and its configuration within FreshRSS. Ensure all relevant feed content areas are sanitized by FreshRSS. Regularly update the sanitizer library used by FreshRSS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Output Encoding](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_output_encoding.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Output Contexts:** FreshRSS developers need to identify all contexts where feed content is displayed in the UI (HTML, JavaScript, URLs).
2.  **Choose Encoding Functions:** FreshRSS should use appropriate output encoding functions for each context (HTML entity encoding, JavaScript encoding, URL encoding).
3.  **Apply Encoding in Templating Engine:** FreshRSS should integrate output encoding functions directly into its templating engine. Ensure automatic encoding of dynamic content from RSS feeds based on context.
4.  **Avoid Manual Encoding:** FreshRSS development should minimize manual encoding in code, relying on the templating engine's automatic features.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents XSS vulnerabilities in FreshRSS arising from improper output encoding.

**Impact:** High reduction in XSS risks within FreshRSS.

**Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented. FreshRSS probably uses some output encoding, but context-awareness and completeness need verification.

**Missing Implementation:**  Conduct a thorough review of FreshRSS codebase to ensure context-aware output encoding is consistently applied in all templates and output locations. Consider using a templating engine that enforces context-aware encoding in FreshRSS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define CSP Directives:** FreshRSS developers should define a strict Content Security Policy that restricts resource sources. Start restrictive and relax as needed. Directives include `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'`, `style-src 'self'`, `img-src 'self'`, and others to restrict object, frame, base URI, and form actions.
2.  **Implement CSP Header:** FreshRSS should configure its web server to send the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with defined directives for all pages.
3.  **Test and Refine CSP:** FreshRSS developers should thoroughly test the CSP in a staging environment and refine it based on browser console errors.
4.  **Report-URI (Optional but Recommended):** FreshRSS could include a `report-uri` directive to receive reports of CSP violations for monitoring and refinement.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Provides defense-in-depth against XSS in FreshRSS, limiting injected script capabilities.
*   **Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):** Can help mitigate certain data injection attacks within FreshRSS.

**Impact:** High reduction in XSS risk within FreshRSS, significant defense-in-depth.

**Currently Implemented:** Potentially partially implemented. FreshRSS might have a basic CSP, but it's likely not as strict or comprehensive as it could be.

**Missing Implementation:**  Implement a strict and well-defined CSP in FreshRSS. Review and strengthen the existing CSP to be more restrictive. Consider making CSP directives configurable for administrators within FreshRSS settings.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining sensitive information about FreshRSS internals through verbose error messages.
*   **Application Debugging Information Leakage (Medium Severity):** Avoids leaking debugging information that could aid attackers in finding FreshRSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Medium reduction in information disclosure risks from FreshRSS.

**Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented. FreshRSS probably avoids displaying very detailed errors to users in production, but error logging security needs review.

**Missing Implementation:**  Review and strengthen error handling in FreshRSS to ensure no sensitive information is exposed in user-facing error messages. Verify secure and non-public error logging in FreshRSS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Security Logging](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_security_logging.md)
