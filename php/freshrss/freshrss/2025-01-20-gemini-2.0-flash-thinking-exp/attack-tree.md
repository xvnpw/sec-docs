## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit FreshRSS Vulnerability -> Exploit Feed Processing Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Content via RSS Feed -> Target Specific Tags/Attributes](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_freshrss_vulnerability_-_exploit_feed_processing_vulnerabilities_-_inject_mal_639dd6a7.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers craft malicious RSS feeds specifically targeting HTML tags or attributes known to be vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `href` with `javascript:`).
    * Likelihood: High - This is a common and well-understood attack vector in web applications and feed readers.
    * Impact: Moderate - Successful exploitation typically leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute malicious JavaScript in the user's browser. This can result in session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    * Effort: Low - Many readily available payloads and tools exist for crafting XSS attacks.
    * Skill Level: Intermediate - Requires a basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and common XSS techniques.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium - Can be detected with proper input sanitization, Content Security Policy (CSP), and regular security testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit FreshRSS Vulnerability -> Exploit Configuration or Deployment Issues -> Leverage Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_freshrss_vulnerability_-_exploit_configuration_or_deployment__6234b211.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to log in to FreshRSS using default usernames and passwords that were not changed during the initial setup.
    * Likelihood: Medium - Unfortunately, many systems are deployed with default credentials that are never updated.
    * Impact: Critical - Successful login grants the attacker full administrative access to FreshRSS. This allows them to manage feeds, users, and potentially access sensitive data or compromise the underlying system.
    * Effort: Very Low - Simply trying common default usernames and passwords.
    * Skill Level: Novice - Requires no specialized technical skills.
    * Detection Difficulty: Very Easy - Login attempts with default credentials should be easily logged and flagged by security systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit FreshRSS Vulnerability -> Exploit Configuration or Deployment Issues -> Exploit Exposed Debug/Admin Interfaces](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_freshrss_vulnerability_-_exploit_configuration_or_deployment_issues_-_exploit__38b943e4.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers identify and access publicly accessible debug or administrative interfaces of FreshRSS. These interfaces often lack proper authentication or contain functionalities that can be abused.
    * Likelihood: Low - This usually results from misconfiguration or oversight during deployment.
    * Impact: Critical - Access to debug/admin interfaces can provide attackers with significant control over FreshRSS, potentially allowing them to view sensitive information, modify configurations, or even execute arbitrary code.
    * Effort: Low - Often involves simply browsing to a specific URL or using readily available tools to scan for open ports and services.
    * Skill Level: Intermediate - Requires a basic understanding of web application architecture and common administrative interfaces.
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy - Network scans and security audits should identify exposed administrative interfaces.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit FreshRSS Vulnerability -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in FreshRSS Dependencies -> Identify Outdated Libraries -> Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_freshrss_vulnerability_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_freshrss__61f41891.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers identify outdated third-party libraries used by FreshRSS that have known security vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs). They then attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    * Likelihood: Medium - While identifying outdated libraries is highly likely, successfully exploiting them depends on the availability of exploits and the specific vulnerability.
    * Impact: Critical - Exploiting dependency vulnerabilities can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to gain complete control over the server.
    * Effort: Medium - Requires identifying vulnerable libraries and potentially adapting or developing exploits.
    * Skill Level: Advanced - Requires knowledge of specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and potentially reverse engineering.
    * Detection Difficulty: Difficult - Requires monitoring for specific exploit attempts and potentially analyzing network traffic for malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit FreshRSS Vulnerability -> Exploit Logic Flaws in FreshRSS Code -> Bypass Authentication/Authorization within FreshRSS](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_freshrss_vulnerability_-_exploit_logic_flaws_in_freshrss_code_-_bypass_authent_c7bb450b.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers discover and exploit flaws in FreshRSS's code that allow them to bypass the normal authentication or authorization mechanisms. This could involve manipulating requests, exploiting logic errors, or leveraging race conditions.
    * Likelihood: Low - Requires significant vulnerabilities in the core authentication/authorization logic.
    * Impact: Critical - Successful bypass grants unauthorized access to all features and data within FreshRSS, potentially allowing attackers to perform any action a legitimate user or administrator could.
    * Effort: High - Requires a deep understanding of the FreshRSS codebase and security principles.
    * Skill Level: Expert - Requires advanced reverse engineering, security analysis, and potentially programming skills.
    * Detection Difficulty: Difficult - May not leave obvious traces in logs and requires careful analysis of application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit FreshRSS Vulnerability -> Exploit Logic Flaws in FreshRSS Code -> Exploit Insecure Data Handling -> SQL Injection (if applicable and not properly mitigated)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_freshrss_vulnerability_-_exploit_logic_flaws_in_freshrss_code_-_exploit_insecu_598ad6be.md)

* Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are then used in database queries without proper sanitization.
    * Likelihood: Low - FreshRSS primarily uses SQLite, which is less susceptible to traditional SQL injection. However, coding errors or the use of other database systems could introduce this vulnerability.
    * Impact: Critical - Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. In some cases, it can even lead to remote code execution on the database server.
    * Effort: High - Requires a deep understanding of SQL syntax and database interactions.
    * Skill Level: Advanced - Requires expertise in SQL and web security vulnerabilities.
    * Detection Difficulty: Difficult - Requires careful analysis of database queries and input validation logic.
