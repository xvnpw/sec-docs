# Threat Model Analysis for freshrss/freshrss

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through malicious content in RSS feeds](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_malicious_content_in_rss_feeds.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into an RSS feed they control. When a user views this feed within the application, the malicious script executes in their browser. This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Impact:** User accounts could be compromised, leading to unauthorized access to their data or the ability to perform actions as the user. Sensitive information displayed through the application could be stolen. The application's functionality could be disrupted for the user.

**Affected Component:** Feed Rendering Module (specifically the component responsible for displaying feed content in the user interface).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
*   Sanitize and encode all feed content before rendering it in the user interface.
*   Use a templating engine that automatically escapes output by default.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via feed fetching](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_feed_fetching.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate a feed URL or content to cause the FreshRSS server to make requests to internal network resources or external, unintended targets. This could be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or launch attacks against other systems.

**Impact:** Exposure of internal services and data. Potential for further exploitation of internal systems. Possible denial-of-service against internal or external targets.

**Affected Component:** Feed Fetcher Module (the component responsible for retrieving content from RSS feed URLs).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a strict allow-list of allowed protocols and ports for feed URLs.
*   Sanitize and validate feed URLs before making requests.
*   Disable or restrict the ability to follow redirects during feed fetching.
*   Consider using a proxy server for outbound requests from the feed fetcher.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) injection through feed parsing](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_through_feed_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious RSS feed containing external entity declarations. If the XML parser used by FreshRSS is not properly configured, it could attempt to resolve these external entities, potentially leading to the disclosure of local files on the server, internal network access, or denial-of-service.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files on the server's filesystem. Potential for remote code execution in some scenarios (though less likely in modern PHP configurations). Denial-of-service.

**Affected Component:** Feed Parsing Module (the component responsible for parsing the XML content of RSS feeds).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure the XML parser to disable the processing of external entities.
*   Use a secure XML parsing library and keep it updated.

## Threat: [Authentication bypass or privilege escalation within FreshRSS](./threats/authentication_bypass_or_privilege_escalation_within_freshrss.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within FreshRSS's authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow an attacker to bypass login procedures or gain access to administrative functionalities without proper credentials. This could allow them to manipulate feeds, user accounts, or application settings.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and application settings. Potential for data manipulation or deletion. Complete compromise of the FreshRSS instance.

**Affected Component:** Authentication and Authorization Modules (components responsible for verifying user identities and controlling access to resources).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep FreshRSS updated to the latest version to patch known authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce strong password policies for user accounts.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication if supported by FreshRSS or through a reverse proxy.
*   Regularly review user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in FreshRSS's update mechanism](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_freshrss's_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** If the process for updating FreshRSS itself is not secure, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code during an update, compromising the entire application. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks or compromising the update server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the FreshRSS instance. Potential for persistent backdoor installation.

**Affected Component:** Update Mechanism Module (the component responsible for downloading and installing updates).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that updates are downloaded over HTTPS.
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded updates using cryptographic signatures.
*   Obtain updates only from the official FreshRSS repository or trusted sources.
