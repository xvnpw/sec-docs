# Threat Model Analysis for freshrss/freshrss

## Threat: [Malicious Feed Content (Code Execution - Hypothetical)](./threats/malicious_feed_content__code_execution_-_hypothetical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a feed with specially designed content that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in FreshRSS's parsing logic or in a third-party library used for feed processing. The goal is to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the server. *This is less likely with proper input sanitization, but remains a possibility.*
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the FreshRSS instance and potentially the underlying server. This could lead to data theft, data modification, or the use of the server for malicious purposes.
*   **Affected Component:** `FreshRSS_Feed_Factory`, XML parsing libraries (e.g., `SimplePie`, or built-in PHP XML functions), any component that handles feed content without proper sanitization (e.g., functions that generate HTML output from feed data).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Rigorous input validation and sanitization of *all* feed content at multiple levels (before parsing, after parsing, before display). Assume *all* feed data is potentially malicious.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing, focusing on the feed parsing and processing components.
        *   Keep all third-party libraries (especially XML parsers) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules to detect and block common exploit patterns.
        *   Use a least privilege model for the web server user, limiting its access to the filesystem and database.

## Threat: [Malicious Extension (Privilege Escalation)](./threats/malicious_extension__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker installs a malicious extension, either by tricking an administrator or by exploiting a vulnerability in the extension installation process. The malicious extension contains code that allows the attacker to gain elevated privileges within FreshRSS, potentially accessing other users' data or administrative functions.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to other users' accounts, potential system compromise (depending on the extension's capabilities).
*   **Affected Component:** Extension API (`./app/Extensions/`), extension loading mechanism (`./app/Models/Extension.php`), any component that interacts with extensions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement a strict sandboxing mechanism for extensions, limiting their access to the core FreshRSS system and data. This could involve running extensions in separate processes or using security contexts.
        *   Provide a clear and well-documented API for extensions, with strong security guidelines for developers.
        *   Implement a code signing mechanism for extensions to verify their authenticity and integrity.
        *   Create an official extension repository with a vetting process for submitted extensions.
    *   **User/Admin:**
        *   Only install extensions from trusted sources (e.g., the official FreshRSS extension repository).
        *   Carefully review the permissions requested by an extension before installing it.
        *   Regularly review installed extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or are suspicious.

## Threat: [Malicious Feed Content (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/malicious_feed_content__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controlling a malicious feed crafts a feed with an extremely large number of entries, excessively large entry sizes, or deeply nested XML structures. The attacker's goal is to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) during feed parsing and processing, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for all users. The FreshRSS instance becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing their feeds. Potentially, the server itself could become unstable.
*   **Affected Component:** `FreshRSS_Feed_Factory`, XML parsing libraries (e.g., `SimplePie`, or built-in PHP XML functions), database write operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement strict limits on feed size, entry count, and XML nesting depth within `FreshRSS_Feed_Factory` and related parsing functions.
        *   Use a robust XML parser with built-in safeguards against resource exhaustion attacks (e.g., entity expansion limits). Consider alternatives to `SimplePie` if it proves vulnerable.
        *   Implement a timeout mechanism for feed fetching and parsing.
        *   Implement a circuit breaker pattern to temporarily disable feeds that consistently cause problems.
    *   **User/Admin:**
        *   Monitor server resource usage.
        *   Be cautious about subscribing to unknown or untrusted feeds.
