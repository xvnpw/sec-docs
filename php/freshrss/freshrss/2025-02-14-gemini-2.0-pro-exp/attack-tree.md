## Attack Tree Path: [XXE via OPML Import [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/xxe_via_opml_import__high_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious OPML file containing XML External Entities (XXE) and uploads it to FreshRSS. When FreshRSS parses the file, the XXE payload is executed, potentially allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, access internal resources, or even achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the XML parser is misconfigured.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [RCE via Feed Parsing {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/rce_via_feed_parsing_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the libraries FreshRSS uses to parse RSS or Atom feeds. This could be a buffer overflow, format string bug, or another memory corruption issue. Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), giving the attacker complete control over the FreshRSS server.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Very High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [SSRF via Feed URL [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/ssrf_via_feed_url__high_.md)

*   **Description:** FreshRSS fetches feeds from URLs provided by users. If FreshRSS doesn't properly validate these URLs, an attacker can provide a URL pointing to an internal service or a sensitive resource. This allows the attacker to make requests on behalf of the FreshRSS server (Server-Side Request Forgery), potentially accessing internal data or services.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force Login [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_login__high_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses automated tools to repeatedly try different usernames and passwords, attempting to guess a valid user's credentials. This is effective if FreshRSS doesn't implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Configuration [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_configuration__high_.md)

*   **Description:** FreshRSS is deployed with insecure default settings (e.g., default administrator password, debug mode enabled, exposed sensitive files) or the administrator makes insecure configuration choices. An attacker exploits these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Extension [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_extension__high_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates and distributes a malicious FreshRSS extension. When a user installs this extension, it executes malicious code within the context of the FreshRSS instance, potentially stealing data, modifying feeds, or gaining complete control.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Outdated Extension [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/outdated_extension__high_.md)

*   **Description:** A user installs a FreshRSS extension that contains a known vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise the FreshRSS instance. This is more likely if users don't regularly update their extensions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable 3rd-Party Dependency within Extension [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_3rd-party_dependency_within_extension__high_.md)

*   **Description:** A FreshRSS extension relies on a third-party library that contains a known vulnerability. Even if the extension's code itself is secure, the vulnerable dependency introduces a weakness that an attacker can exploit.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Values [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/default_values__high_.md)

*   **Description:** FreshRSS is deployed with insecure default settings (e.g., default administrator password) and administrator does not change them.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Very Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing Sanitization [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/missing_sanitization__high_.md)

*   **Description:** If user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
