# Attack Surface Analysis for freshrss/freshrss

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Feed Content (Parsing Exploits)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_feed_content__parsing_exploits_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the feed parsing libraries (e.g., SimplePie) used by FreshRSS through specially crafted malicious RSS/Atom feeds.
*   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS's *core function* is to fetch and parse feeds from potentially untrusted external sources. It relies on external libraries for this parsing, making this a direct and inherent risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a feed containing a malformed XML structure designed to trigger a buffer overflow in SimplePie, leading to remote code execution. Or, an "XML bomb" is used to cause excessive memory consumption.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Maintain up-to-date dependencies (especially SimplePie or any other parsing library). Apply security patches *immediately*.
        *   Implement robust input validation *before* passing data to the parsing library. This should include checks for well-formed XML, size limits, and potentially character encoding validation. This is *crucial* even if the library claims to be secure.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment or process isolation for feed parsing.
        *   Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, time) for parsing operations.
        *   Thoroughly fuzz test the parsing components with a variety of malformed inputs.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep FreshRSS updated to the latest version. This is the *most important* user-side mitigation.
        *   Be cautious about adding feeds from unknown or untrusted sources.
        *   Monitor FreshRSS logs for errors related to feed parsing.
        *   Consider using a WAF with rules to detect and block malicious XML payloads (advanced users).
        *   Disable Javascript in feeds.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Feed URLs](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_feed_urls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious feed URL that causes FreshRSS to make requests to internal network resources or unintended external servers.
*   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS *directly* fetches content from URLs provided by users. This is a core part of its functionality. If these URLs are not properly validated, FreshRSS can be tricked.
*   **Example:** An attacker adds a feed with the URL `http://127.0.0.1:22` (or an internal IP address) to attempt to access the server's SSH port or other internal services. Or, they use a URL like `file:///etc/passwd`.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (by targeting internal services), Port Scanning.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement *strict* URL validation. Only allow `http://` and `https://` schemes.
        *   Implement a *whitelist* of allowed domains or IP addresses for feed sources, if feasible. This is the *best* defense.
        *   If a whitelist is not feasible, implement a blacklist of known-bad domains and IP addresses (private IP ranges, localhost, etc.).
        *   Configure FreshRSS to use a dedicated DNS resolver that is configured to *not* resolve internal hostnames.
        *   Do *not* follow redirects blindly. Limit the number of redirects and validate the final destination URL.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be *very* cautious about adding feeds from unknown or untrusted sources.
        *   Review the feed URLs added to FreshRSS to ensure they are legitimate.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party extensions installed in FreshRSS may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
*   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS *allows* the installation of extensions to expand its functionality. These extensions are often developed by third parties and may not be as thoroughly vetted as the core FreshRSS code.
*   **Example:** An attacker finds a vulnerability in a popular FreshRSS extension that allows them to upload arbitrary files to the server, leading to RCE.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Privilege Escalation, Defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the extension's functionality).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Provide clear guidelines and security recommendations for extension developers.
        *   Consider implementing a review process for extensions before they are made publicly available.
        *   Implement a mechanism for users to report vulnerabilities in extensions.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Only install extensions from trusted sources.
        *   Carefully vet extensions before installing them. Review the source code if possible.
        *   Keep extensions updated to the latest versions.
        *   Remove any unused extensions.
        *   Monitor extension activity for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Vulnerabilities (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** If FreshRSS exposes API endpoints, these could be vulnerable to various attacks if not properly secured.
*   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS *may* expose API endpoints for various functionalities. These endpoints need to be secured like any other web API. The attack surface is directly related to FreshRSS exposing these endpoints.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an unauthenticated API endpoint that allows them to add or delete feeds, or to access user data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Data Access, Data Modification, Denial of Service, Potential for RCE (depending on the API functionality).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the API functionality and authentication).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Ensure *all* API endpoints require authentication.
        *   Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
        *   Implement authorization checks to ensure users can only access the data and functionality they are permitted to.
        *   Implement rate limiting and other protections against API abuse.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all API inputs.
        *   Follow secure coding practices for API development (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10).
    *   **Users:**
        *   If using API keys, keep them secret and rotate them regularly.
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
