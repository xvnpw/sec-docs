# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in FreshRSS

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within FreshRSS, identify specific code locations and mechanisms that contribute to the risk, and propose concrete, actionable remediation steps beyond the high-level mitigations already outlined.  We aim to provide developers with a clear understanding of *why* the vulnerability exists and *how* to effectively eliminate it.  For administrators, we aim to provide clear configuration and deployment guidance to minimize risk.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the SSRF vulnerability related to feed URL handling within FreshRSS.  It encompasses:

*   **Code Analysis:**  Identifying the PHP code responsible for fetching and processing feed URLs.
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  Examining FreshRSS configuration options that impact SSRF vulnerability.
*   **Network Interaction:**  Understanding how FreshRSS interacts with the network and DNS resolution.
*   **Bypass Techniques:**  Considering potential ways an attacker might bypass initial, naive mitigations.

This analysis *does not* cover other potential attack surfaces within FreshRSS (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQLi) unless they directly relate to the SSRF vulnerability.

## 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be used:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the FreshRSS source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to pinpoint the functions and classes involved in:
    *   Adding new feeds (user input).
    *   Fetching feed content (making HTTP/HTTPS requests).
    *   Handling redirects.
    *   Validating URLs.
    *   Error handling related to network requests.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical):**  While we won't be performing live dynamic analysis in this document, we will *hypothesize* about the behavior of the application based on the code review.  This includes:
    *   Simulating malicious feed URL inputs.
    *   Predicting the application's response.
    *   Identifying potential bypasses of implemented security controls.

3.  **Configuration Review:** We will analyze the FreshRSS configuration files (e.g., `config.php`, `.env`) and documentation to identify settings that can influence SSRF protection.

4.  **Mitigation Recommendation Refinement:**  Based on the code and configuration analysis, we will refine the initial mitigation strategies, providing specific code examples, configuration directives, and best practices.

### 4.1 Code Analysis (Key Areas)

Based on a review of the FreshRSS codebase, the following areas are critical to the SSRF vulnerability:

*   **`app/Models/FeedDAO.php` (and related DAO classes):**  This likely handles the storage and retrieval of feed URLs from the database.  While not directly involved in fetching, it's crucial to ensure that no pre-processing or "normalization" of the URL occurs here that could inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities.

*   **`app/Feed/Feed.php` (and related Feed classes):** This is a likely candidate for containing the logic that fetches feed content.  We need to examine the methods used for:
    *   Creating HTTP requests (e.g., using cURL, `file_get_contents`, or a dedicated HTTP client library).
    *   Setting request options (timeouts, headers, etc.).
    *   Handling responses and errors.

*   **`lib/Minz/Url.php` (or similar URL handling classes):**  FreshRSS likely has utility classes for parsing and manipulating URLs.  We need to scrutinize these for:
    *   URL validation logic (scheme validation, hostname validation).
    *   Functions that might be used to "normalize" or "sanitize" URLs.  These can be a source of bypasses if not implemented carefully.

*   **`app/Controllers/feedController.php` (or similar controllers):** This is where user input (the feed URL) is likely received and passed to the model/DAO layers.  We need to check:
    *   How the feed URL is retrieved from the request.
    *   If any initial validation is performed *before* passing the URL to other components.

* **`lib/freshrss_curl.php`** This file likely contains custom cURL wrapper functions. This is a *critical* area to examine, as cURL's behavior can be complex and easily misconfigured, leading to SSRF vulnerabilities. We need to check for:
    - Explicit disabling of dangerous cURL options (e.g., `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION`, if not handled carefully).
    - Proper handling of timeouts to prevent denial-of-service.
    - Validation of the URL *after* following redirects.

**Specific Code Concerns (Hypothetical Examples - need to be verified against actual code):**

*   **Insufficient Scheme Validation:**  If the code only checks for the presence of `://` without explicitly verifying that the scheme is `http` or `https`, an attacker could use schemes like `file://`, `gopher://`, or `dict://`.

    ```php
    // VULNERABLE (example)
    if (strpos($url, '://') !== false) {
        // Fetch the feed
    }

    // BETTER (but still incomplete)
    if (in_array(parse_url($url, PHP_URL_SCHEME), ['http', 'https'])) {
        // Fetch the feed
    }
    ```

*   **Lack of Hostname/IP Blacklisting/Whitelisting:**  Even with proper scheme validation, the code must prevent requests to internal IP addresses (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` to `172.31.x.x`) and internal hostnames.

    ```php
    // VULNERABLE (example) - No IP address checks
    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);
    // ... fetch the feed ...

    // BETTER (using a blacklist - still needs refinement)
    $blacklist = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost', '192.168.0.0/16', ...];
    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);
    if (!in_array($hostname, $blacklist) && !ip_in_cidr($hostname, $blacklist)) {
        // Fetch the feed
    }

    // BEST (using a whitelist - if feasible)
    $whitelist = ['example.com', 'feeds.example.net', ...];
    $hostname = parse_url($url, PHP_URL_HOST);
    if (in_array($hostname, $whitelist)) {
        // Fetch the feed
    }
    ```
    (Note: `ip_in_cidr` is a hypothetical function; you'd need to implement or find a library function for CIDR range checking.)

*   **Unsafe Redirect Handling:**  If FreshRSS follows redirects (using `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` in cURL, for example), it *must* re-validate the URL *after* each redirect.  An attacker could redirect from a seemingly safe URL to an internal resource.

    ```php
    // VULNERABLE (example) - Follows redirects without re-validation
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
    // ...

    // BETTER (limit redirects and re-validate)
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 5); // Limit the number of redirects
    // ... (after curl_exec) ...
    $final_url = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL);
    if (validate_url($final_url)) { // Re-validate the final URL
        // Process the response
    }
    ```

*   **DNS Resolution Issues:**  Even with IP address blacklisting, an attacker might use a public DNS name that resolves to an internal IP address.  This is why using a dedicated, non-recursive DNS resolver is crucial.

*   **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Issues:**  There's a potential (though less likely) TOCTOU vulnerability if the URL is validated, then a significant delay occurs before the request is made.  During that delay, the DNS record could be changed to point to an internal IP address.  Minimizing the time between validation and request is important.

### 4.2 Configuration Analysis

*   **`./data/config.php` and `.env`:**  These files should be reviewed for any settings related to:
    *   **Proxy settings:**  If FreshRSS is configured to use a proxy, ensure the proxy itself is not vulnerable to SSRF.
    *   **Timeout settings:**  Appropriate timeouts should be configured to prevent denial-of-service attacks that target internal services.
    *   **Allowed/Disallowed schemes/hosts (if any):**  Check for any existing configuration options that could be used to implement a whitelist or blacklist.  Even if not directly supported, environment variables could be used to influence the application's behavior.
    * **cURL options:** Check if there is possibility to configure cURL.

### 4.3 Network Interaction

*   **DNS Resolution:**  As mentioned, FreshRSS should ideally use a dedicated DNS resolver that is configured to *not* resolve internal hostnames.  This can be achieved through:
    *   **System-level configuration:**  Configuring the server's `/etc/resolv.conf` to point to a specific DNS server.
    *   **Containerization (Docker):**  Using a separate container for DNS resolution and configuring FreshRSS to use that container.  Docker's internal DNS can be configured to prevent resolution of internal names.
    *   **PHP-level configuration (less reliable):**  Attempting to use PHP's `dns_get_record` function with a specific DNS server is *not* a reliable solution, as it may be bypassed by underlying libraries (like cURL).

### 4.4 Mitigation Recommendation Refinement

Based on the above analysis, here are refined mitigation recommendations:

1.  **Strict URL Validation (Code Level):**
    *   **Scheme Whitelist:**  *Only* allow `http` and `https` schemes.  Use `parse_url($url, PHP_URL_SCHEME)` and a strict `in_array` check.
    *   **Hostname/IP Validation:**
        *   **Whitelist (Preferred):** If feasible, maintain a whitelist of allowed feed domains.
        *   **Blacklist (Fallback):** If a whitelist is not possible, maintain a comprehensive blacklist of private IP ranges, localhost, and any other known-bad domains.  Use a robust CIDR range checking library.
        *   **Disallow IP Addresses Directly:** Prevent users from entering IP addresses directly as feed URLs.  Require hostnames.

2.  **Safe Redirect Handling (Code Level):**
    *   **Limit Redirects:**  Set a reasonable limit on the number of redirects (e.g., `CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS` in cURL).
    *   **Re-validate After Each Redirect:**  After each redirect, re-validate the resulting URL using the same strict validation rules as the initial URL.

3.  **Dedicated DNS Resolver (System/Container Level):**
    *   Configure a dedicated DNS resolver (e.g., Unbound, dnsmasq) that is *not* configured to resolve internal hostnames.
    *   Configure FreshRSS (or the underlying system) to use this resolver.

4.  **cURL Configuration (Code Level):**
    *   **Disable Risky Options:**  Explicitly disable any unnecessary or risky cURL options.
    *   **Set Timeouts:**  Set appropriate timeouts (`CURLOPT_TIMEOUT`, `CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT`) to prevent DoS.

5.  **Input Sanitization (Code Level):**
    *   While URL validation is the primary defense, ensure that the feed URL is properly escaped before being used in any database queries or other contexts to prevent other vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection).

6.  **Regular Updates:** Keep FreshRSS and all its dependencies (including PHP, cURL, and any HTTP client libraries) up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

7.  **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

8. **User Education:** Remind users to be cautious when adding feeds from unknown sources.

## 5. Conclusion

The SSRF vulnerability in FreshRSS related to feed URLs is a serious issue due to the application's core functionality of fetching external content.  By implementing the refined mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SSRF attacks.  A combination of strict URL validation, safe redirect handling, a dedicated DNS resolver, and careful cURL configuration is essential for robust protection.  Continuous monitoring, regular updates, and security audits are also crucial for maintaining a secure environment.
