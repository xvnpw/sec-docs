### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving FreshRSS

*   **Threat:** Malicious Feed Content Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious RSS feed containing embedded JavaScript or HTML. When a user views this feed within FreshRSS, the malicious script executes in their browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or modifying the content of the FreshRSS page.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft (e.g., session cookies), defacement of the FreshRSS interface for the affected user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Feed Parser, Content Display module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all feed content before rendering it in the user's browser.
        *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   Regularly update FreshRSS to benefit from security patches.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Feed Fetching
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious RSS feed containing URLs pointing to internal network resources or other sensitive endpoints. When FreshRSS fetches this feed, it inadvertently makes requests to these internal resources on behalf of the attacker. This can allow the attacker to probe internal systems, access internal services, or potentially bypass firewalls.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure about internal infrastructure, potential access to internal services not intended for public access, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Affected Component:** Feed Fetcher module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict URL validation and filtering for feed sources, preventing requests to internal or blacklisted IP addresses and hostnames.
        *   Consider using a dedicated service or proxy for fetching external content, isolating the FreshRSS application from direct network access.
        *   Enforce network segmentation to limit the impact of potential SSRF vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection during Feed Parsing
    *   **Description:** If FreshRSS's XML parsing library is not properly configured, an attacker can craft a malicious RSS feed containing external entity declarations that, when parsed, allow the attacker to access local files on the server or interact with internal network resources.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files on the server, potential access to internal systems, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Feed Parser (XML processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable external entity processing in the XML parser configuration.
        *   Ensure the XML parsing library is up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Sanitize or validate XML input before parsing.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configuration
    *   **Description:** FreshRSS might have default settings that are not optimal for security, such as weak default administrative credentials or overly permissive access controls. An attacker could exploit these defaults to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the FreshRSS instance, potential access to underlying server resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Installation, Configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for administrative accounts upon initial setup.
        *   Provide clear documentation and guidance on secure configuration practices.
        *   Regularly review and harden the FreshRSS configuration.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information through Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** If FreshRSS configuration files are not properly protected, they could reveal sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or other secrets. An attacker gaining access to these files could compromise the application or related systems.
    *   **Impact:** Database compromise, access to external services, full compromise of FreshRSS.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Management, File System.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict file system permissions on configuration files to only the necessary users and groups.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text within configuration files. Consider using environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Proper Input Sanitization in Administrative Interface
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the FreshRSS administrative interface could allow attackers to inject malicious code or commands through input fields. This could lead to various attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) affecting administrators or even remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, remote code execution, compromise of the FreshRSS instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Administrative Interface, Input Handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all data entered through the administrative interface.
        *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to administrative accounts.

*   **Threat:** Unprotected Update Mechanism
    *   **Description:** If the FreshRSS update mechanism is not secure, an attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack and inject malicious code during the update process, compromising the application.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the FreshRSS instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Update Mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that updates are downloaded over HTTPS.
        *   Implement signature verification for update packages to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
        *   Provide checksums for update packages to allow users to verify their integrity manually.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Extensions
    *   **Description:** A compromised or intentionally malicious extension could be installed, granting attackers significant control over the FreshRSS application and potentially the underlying server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of FreshRSS, potential access to the underlying server and data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extensions/Plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when installing extensions. Only install extensions from highly trusted and reputable sources.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing the code of extensions before installation, if feasible.

*   **Threat:** Session Management Vulnerabilities within FreshRSS
    *   **Description:** Flaws in how FreshRSS manages user sessions could allow attackers to hijack active sessions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts without needing their credentials. This could involve predictable session IDs, lack of secure flags on cookies, or improper session invalidation.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized actions performed as the legitimate user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Session Management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unpredictable session IDs.
        *   Set secure flags (HttpOnly, Secure) on session cookies.
        *   Implement proper session timeouts and invalidation mechanisms.
