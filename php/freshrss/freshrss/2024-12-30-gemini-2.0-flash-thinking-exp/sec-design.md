## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1. User Interaction Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A("User Browser") --> B("Web Server");
    B -- "HTTP Request" --> C("FreshRSS Application");
    C -- "Process Request & Route" --> D("Logic Modules");
    D -- "Data Access (SQL Queries)" --> E("Database");
    E -- "Data Response" --> D;
    D -- "Generate HTML/JSON Response" --> C;
    C -- "HTTP Response" --> B;
    B --> A;
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ddf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#aaf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#eef,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

*   The **"User Browser"** initiates an interaction by sending an HTTP request (e.g., to view the article list, subscribe to a new feed).
*   The **"Web Server"** receives the HTTP request and forwards it to the **"FreshRSS Application"**.
*   The **"FreshRSS Application"** processes the request, routing it to the appropriate **"Logic Modules"** based on the requested URL or action.
*   The **"Logic Modules"** interact with the **"Database"** by executing SQL queries to retrieve or modify data.
*   The **"Database"** returns the requested data to the **"Logic Modules"**.
*   The **"Logic Modules"** process the data and generate an HTML or JSON response.
*   The **"FreshRSS Application"** sends the HTTP response back to the **"Web Server"**.
*   The **"Web Server"** delivers the response to the **"User Browser"**, which renders the updated interface.

### 4.2. Feed Update Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A("Scheduler (Cron/Systemd)") --> B("FreshRSS Application");
    B -- "Trigger Feed Update Task" --> C("Feed Fetcher");
    C -- "HTTP Request (GET)" --> D("External RSS/Atom Feed");
    D -- "Feed Content (XML)" --> C;
    C -- "Parse Feed Content" --> E("Feed Parser");
    E -- "Extract & Normalize Articles" --> F("Article Storage Module");
    F -- "Store/Update Articles (SQL)" --> G("Database");
    style A fill:#aaf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ddf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#aaf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#ffe,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#aaf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#aaf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#eef,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

*   A **"Scheduler (Cron/Systemd)"** triggers the feed update process at scheduled intervals.
*   The **"FreshRSS Application"** receives the trigger and initiates the **"Feed Fetcher"**.
*   The **"Feed Fetcher"** sends an HTTP GET request to the **"External RSS/Atom Feed"**.
*   The **"External RSS/Atom Feed"** responds with the feed content, typically in XML format.
*   The **"Feed Fetcher"** passes the content to the **"Feed Parser"**.
*   The **"Feed Parser"** extracts and normalizes article data from the XML.
*   The **"Article Storage Module"** receives the parsed articles.
*   The **"Article Storage Module"** interacts with the **"Database"** to store new articles or update existing ones.
