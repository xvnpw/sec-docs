*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Feed Content**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into feed content (titles, descriptions, etc.). When a user views this feed in FreshRSS, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS fetches and renders content from external sources (RSS/Atom feeds) without sufficient sanitization or content security policies.
    *   **Example:** A feed item with a title like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` would execute the JavaScript alert when viewed in FreshRSS.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the FreshRSS interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all feed content before rendering it in the browser. Use a well-vetted library for this purpose.
            *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
            *   Consider using a sandboxed iframe to render feed content, limiting the scope of potential damage from malicious scripts.

*   **Attack Surface: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Malicious Feed URLs**
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious feed URL that, when fetched by FreshRSS, causes the server to make requests to internal resources or external services that it should not have access to.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS fetches content from URLs provided by users when subscribing to feeds. If not properly validated, these URLs can point to internal network resources or unintended external targets.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a feed URL like `http://localhost:6379/` (if Redis is running on the same server) or `http://internal-server/admin`. FreshRSS would attempt to fetch content from these internal resources.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of feed URLs.
            *   Use a whitelist approach to restrict the allowed protocols and domains for feed URLs.
            *   Consider using a dedicated service or library for fetching external resources that provides SSRF protection.

*   **Attack Surface: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via Malicious Feed Content**
    *   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious XML content within a feed that, when parsed by FreshRSS, allows them to access local files on the server or interact with internal or external systems.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS parses XML content from RSS and Atom feeds. If the XML parser is not configured securely, it might process external entities defined in the XML.
    *   **Example:** A malicious feed might contain XML like `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><item><title>&xxe;</title></item>`. When parsed, this could expose the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (local files, internal network information), potential for denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Disable the processing of external entities in the XML parser configuration. This is the most effective mitigation.
            *   If external entities are absolutely necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the XML content.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Extensions/Plugins**
    *   **Description:** If FreshRSS supports extensions or plugins, vulnerabilities in these third-party components can introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** By providing a mechanism for extending its functionality with external code, FreshRSS inherits the security risks associated with those extensions.
    *   **Example:** A poorly coded extension might be vulnerable to XSS, SQL injection, or other vulnerabilities, which could then be exploited to compromise the FreshRSS installation.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including account compromise, data theft, remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement a secure extension API with clear guidelines and security best practices for extension developers.
            *   Implement a mechanism for reviewing and vetting extensions before they are made available to users.
            *   Consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate extensions from the core application.
