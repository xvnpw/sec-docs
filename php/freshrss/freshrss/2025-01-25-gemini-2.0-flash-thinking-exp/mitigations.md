# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for freshrss/freshrss

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Software Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_software_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor FreshRSS Releases:** Regularly check the official FreshRSS GitHub repository ([https://github.com/freshrss/freshrss/releases](https://github.com/freshrss/freshrss/releases)) or the FreshRSS website for new releases and security announcements.
    2.  **Review Release Notes:** Carefully read the release notes for each new version to identify security fixes and improvements provided by the FreshRSS development team.
    3.  **Download Latest Version:** Download the latest stable version of FreshRSS from the official source.
    4.  **Apply Updates:** Follow the official FreshRSS update instructions, which are specific to the FreshRSS project and typically involve replacing files and potentially running database migrations provided by FreshRSS.
    5.  **Test After Update:** After updating, thoroughly test your FreshRSS instance to ensure it functions correctly and no regressions were introduced by the update.
    6.  **Subscribe to Security Notifications (if available):** Check if FreshRSS offers a security mailing list or notification system to receive immediate alerts about critical security updates from the FreshRSS project.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Outdated FreshRSS software is vulnerable to publicly known exploits that attackers can leverage to compromise the application. Updating FreshRSS mitigates vulnerabilities fixed by the project developers.
*   **Impact:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known FreshRSS vulnerabilities by ensuring the application is patched against security flaws addressed by the project.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - FreshRSS provides release notes and update instructions on their GitHub and website. Users are responsible for manually checking for updates and applying them.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated update mechanisms *within FreshRSS itself*, in-app update notifications for new releases *within the FreshRSS interface*, and potentially automated security update application (with user confirmation) *as a feature of FreshRSS*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation on Feed URLs](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_on_feed_urls.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement URL Schema Validation in FreshRSS Code:**  Within the FreshRSS codebase (specifically in the feed addition and update functionalities), implement validation to ensure that submitted feed URLs adhere to expected schemas (e.g., `http://`, `https://`) *within the FreshRSS application logic*. Reject URLs with unexpected or malicious schemas *at the FreshRSS application level*.
    2.  **Limit Allowed Protocols in FreshRSS Code:**  Restrict the allowed protocols for feed URLs to `http` and `https` *within the FreshRSS application*. Disallow protocols like `file://`, `ftp://`, `gopher://`, etc., *in FreshRSS's URL handling*, which could be exploited for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.
    3.  **Regular Expression Validation in FreshRSS Code:** Use regular expressions *within FreshRSS code* to validate the format of the URL, ensuring it conforms to a valid URL structure and doesn't contain potentially harmful characters or patterns *as processed by FreshRSS*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Severity): Attackers could manipulate feed URLs to make the FreshRSS server send requests to internal resources or external malicious servers *through FreshRSS's feed fetching mechanism*. Input validation in FreshRSS prevents malicious URLs from being processed.
    *   Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):  Improperly validated URLs could be crafted to inject commands or scripts if processed incorrectly by the application *during FreshRSS feed processing*. Input validation in FreshRSS reduces this risk.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High - Significantly reduces the risk of SSRF and injection attacks through malicious feed URLs *by validating URLs within FreshRSS*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - FreshRSS likely performs basic URL validation to ensure they are valid URLs *at some level*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More robust schema validation, protocol restriction, and potentially blocklisting of suspicious domains/IPs *within FreshRSS's URL handling logic*.  Detailed examination of FreshRSS codebase is needed to confirm current validation level and identify areas for improvement *in the FreshRSS project*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Encode Feed Content](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_encode_feed_content.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Output Points in FreshRSS Code:** Locate all points in the FreshRSS codebase where feed content (titles, descriptions, articles, etc.) is rendered in HTML pages *by FreshRSS*.
    2.  **Implement Output Encoding in FreshRSS Code:** Ensure that all dynamic content from feeds is properly encoded before being displayed in HTML *by FreshRSS*. Use context-aware output encoding functions provided by the templating engine or programming language *used in FreshRSS* (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript encoding, URL encoding).
    3.  **HTML Sanitization in FreshRSS Code (for HTML content in feeds):** If FreshRSS needs to display HTML content from feeds (e.g., in article bodies), use a robust HTML sanitization library (like HTML Purifier or similar) *integrated into FreshRSS* to remove potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `onclick`). Configure the sanitizer to allow only safe HTML elements and attributes necessary for content display *within FreshRSS's content rendering*.
    4.  **Regularly Review Sanitization Rules in FreshRSS:**  Keep the HTML sanitization rules updated *within FreshRSS or the chosen sanitization library* to address new XSS vectors and bypass techniques.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity): Malicious RSS feeds could contain JavaScript code embedded in titles, descriptions, or article content. Without proper sanitization and encoding *by FreshRSS*, this code could be executed in users' browsers when they view the feed in FreshRSS.
*   **Impact:** High -  Crucially mitigates XSS vulnerabilities originating from malicious or compromised RSS feeds, protecting users from client-side attacks *by ensuring FreshRSS sanitizes and encodes content*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Implemented - FreshRSS probably uses some form of output encoding and potentially HTML sanitization to display feed content *as part of its core functionality*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Verification of the robustness and completeness of current sanitization and encoding *in FreshRSS codebase*.  Review the codebase to ensure all output points are properly handled and that a strong HTML sanitization library is used with up-to-date rules *within the FreshRSS project*. Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) *as a feature of FreshRSS* as an additional layer of defense.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__implementation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define CSP Policy for FreshRSS:**  Develop a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) for the FreshRSS application *specifically tailored to FreshRSS's needs*.
    2.  **Implement CSP Header Generation in FreshRSS:** Configure FreshRSS to automatically send the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with the defined policy for all FreshRSS pages *directly from the application*. Alternatively, provide clear documentation for users to configure this in their web server *based on FreshRSS's requirements*.
    3.  **Start with a Restrictive Policy for FreshRSS:** Begin with a restrictive policy that only allows resources from the same origin (`'self'`) and explicitly whitelist necessary external sources (if any, and only if absolutely required) *for FreshRSS's functionality*.
    4.  **Test and Refine CSP for FreshRSS:** Thoroughly test the CSP policy to ensure it doesn't break FreshRSS functionality. Use browser developer tools to identify CSP violations and adjust the policy as needed, while maintaining the highest possible level of security *for FreshRSS*.
    5.  **Consider Reporting (as a FreshRSS Feature):**  Optionally configure CSP reporting *as a feature within FreshRSS* to receive reports of policy violations, which can help identify potential XSS attacks or misconfigurations *related to FreshRSS*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity): CSP acts as a defense-in-depth mechanism against XSS attacks *in FreshRSS*. Even if sanitization or encoding fails *in FreshRSS*, CSP can prevent the execution of malicious scripts injected through feeds by restricting script sources.
    *   Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity): CSP can also help mitigate certain types of data injection attacks *in FreshRSS* by controlling the sources from which data can be loaded.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High - Provides a significant layer of defense against XSS attacks *in FreshRSS*, especially as a fallback if input sanitization or output encoding is bypassed *within FreshRSS*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Not Implemented by Default - CSP is typically not enabled by default in web applications and requires explicit configuration. *FreshRSS likely does not implement CSP headers by default*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of CSP header generation and configuration *within FreshRSS itself* or documentation guiding users on how to configure CSP in their web server *specifically for FreshRSS*.  Potentially provide a default recommended CSP policy *as part of FreshRSS*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Feed Update Frequency and Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/limit_feed_update_frequency_and_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Update Interval in FreshRSS Settings:** In FreshRSS settings, provide granular control over the feed update interval *within the FreshRSS user interface*. Allow administrators to set a minimum update frequency for feeds (e.g., 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour) *through FreshRSS configuration*.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting (Concurrent Fetches) in FreshRSS Code:**  Limit the number of feeds that FreshRSS fetches concurrently *within its feed fetching logic*. This prevents overwhelming server resources if a large number of feeds are scheduled to update at the same time *by FreshRSS*.
    3.  **Implement Rate Limiting (Time-Based) in FreshRSS Code:**  Limit the number of feed fetch requests that FreshRSS makes within a specific time window (e.g., maximum X requests per minute) *within its feed fetching mechanism*. This can protect against excessive fetching and potential DoS attacks on feed providers *originating from FreshRSS*.
    4.  **Prioritize User-Initiated Updates (with Rate Limiting in FreshRSS):**  Ensure that user-initiated feed updates (e.g., "refresh all feeds" button) are also subject to rate limiting *within FreshRSS* to prevent abuse.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Self-Inflicted (Medium Severity):  Aggressively fetching feeds too frequently *by FreshRSS* can overload the FreshRSS server. Rate limiting in FreshRSS prevents this.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Against Feed Providers (Medium Severity):  Excessive fetching *from FreshRSS* can be perceived as a DoS attack by feed providers. Rate limiting in FreshRSS mitigates this.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): Uncontrolled feed fetching *by FreshRSS* can consume excessive server resources. Rate limiting in FreshRSS helps manage resource usage.
*   **Impact:** Medium - Reduces the risk of self-inflicted DoS, DoS against feed providers, and resource exhaustion, improving application stability and responsible resource usage *by controlling FreshRSS's fetching behavior*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - FreshRSS likely has a configurable feed update interval *in its settings*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More granular rate limiting controls, especially for concurrent fetches and time-based limits *within FreshRSS*.  Clear documentation and user interface elements to configure these rate limiting settings *within FreshRSS*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Password Policies and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_password_policies_and_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Password Complexity in FreshRSS:** Implement password complexity requirements for FreshRSS user accounts *within the FreshRSS user management system* (e.g., minimum length, character types - uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    2.  **Password Strength Meter in FreshRSS UI:** Integrate a password strength meter into the user registration and password change forms *in the FreshRSS user interface* to guide users in choosing strong passwords.
    3.  **Password Hashing in FreshRSS Code:** Ensure that FreshRSS uses strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with salting to securely store user passwords in the database *as part of its authentication mechanism*.
    4.  **Consider MFA Support in FreshRSS:**  Investigate and implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) options for FreshRSS logins *as a built-in feature*. This could involve integrating with existing MFA providers or implementing a built-in MFA solution (e.g., TOTP-based) *within FreshRSS*.
    5.  **Account Lockout Policy in FreshRSS:** Implement an account lockout policy *within FreshRSS's authentication system* to temporarily disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts, preventing brute-force password attacks.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Password Attacks (High Severity): Weak passwords are easily cracked through brute-force attacks, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts *in FreshRSS*. Strong password policies and account lockout in FreshRSS mitigate this.
    *   Credential Stuffing Attacks (High Severity): If users reuse passwords across multiple services, compromised credentials from other breaches can be used to access FreshRSS accounts. MFA in FreshRSS adds a layer of protection against this.
    *   Account Takeover (High Severity): Successful password attacks or credential stuffing can lead to account takeover *in FreshRSS*. Strong password policies, MFA, and account lockout in FreshRSS reduce this risk.
*   **Impact:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of password-based attacks and account takeover *of FreshRSS accounts*, protecting user accounts and data *within FreshRSS*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - FreshRSS likely uses password hashing *for user authentication*. Password complexity enforcement and MFA might be missing or limited *as built-in features of FreshRSS*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of password complexity policies, password strength meter, MFA support (TOTP or other methods), and account lockout policies *as features within the FreshRSS project*.  These features would significantly enhance user account security *directly within FreshRSS*.
