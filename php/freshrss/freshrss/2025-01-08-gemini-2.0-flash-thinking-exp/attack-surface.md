# Attack Surface Analysis for freshrss/freshrss

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Feed URL Processing](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_feed_url_processing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the FreshRSS server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS fetches content from user-provided feed URLs. This functionality allows specifying target URLs.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user adds a feed URL pointing to an internal network resource (e.g., `http://internal-server/admin`) or an external service to perform port scanning. FreshRSS attempts to fetch content from this URL.
    *   **Impact:** Internal information disclosure, access to internal services, potential for further attacks on internal infrastructure, denial of service against other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict URL validation and sanitization, use a whitelist of allowed protocols (e.g., only `http://` and `https://`), consider using a separate service or isolated environment for fetching external content. Implement proper error handling to avoid revealing information about failed requests.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via Feed Parsing](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_via_feed_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious XML code into a feed, allowing them to access local files or internal network resources through the FreshRSS server.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS parses XML formatted RSS and Atom feeds. If the XML parser is not configured securely, it might process external entities.
    *   **Example:** A malicious feed contains an external entity definition that attempts to read a local file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) or access an internal network resource.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive files on the server, internal network reconnaissance, potential for denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Disable external entity processing in the XML parser configuration. Ensure the XML parsing library is up-to-date and patched against known XXE vulnerabilities. Sanitize or escape potentially malicious characters in feed content.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Feed Content or Search Results](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_feed_content_or_search_results.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into feed content or search terms, which is then executed in the browsers of other users viewing that content.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS displays content from feeds and search results to users. If this content is not properly sanitized, it can contain malicious scripts.
    *   **Example:** A malicious feed includes a `<script>` tag containing JavaScript that steals cookies or redirects users to a phishing site. Alternatively, a search query containing malicious JavaScript is displayed without proper encoding.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise (cookie theft), redirection to malicious sites, defacement, information theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided content, especially feed content and search results. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary File Upload via Extension/Theme Uploads (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_file_upload_via_extensiontheme_uploads__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** If FreshRSS allows users to upload extensions or themes, vulnerabilities in the upload process can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as a theme file. If the web server is configured to execute PHP files in the upload directory, the attacker can then access and execute this script.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just file extensions. Store uploaded files in a location outside the web server's document root. Ensure proper permissions are set on the upload directory. Consider using a sandboxed environment for processing uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can intercept or manipulate the update process to install malicious code.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** FreshRSS needs a mechanism to update itself. If this process is not secure, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack during an update and replaces the legitimate update package with a malicious one. If integrity checks are missing, the malicious update is installed.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Deliver updates over HTTPS. Implement strong cryptographic signatures and integrity checks for update packages. Ensure the update process verifies the authenticity of the update source.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the API authentication or authorization mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** If FreshRSS exposes an API, weaknesses in how it authenticates and authorizes requests can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint designed for authenticated users is accessible without proper authentication, allowing an attacker to retrieve sensitive data or perform actions they shouldn't.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0). Enforce proper authorization checks on all API endpoints. Avoid exposing sensitive information in API responses unnecessarily. Rate-limit API requests to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data in the FreshRSS database.
    *   **How FreshRSS Contributes:** If FreshRSS uses dynamically constructed SQL queries without proper sanitization of user input, it can be vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable search function allows an attacker to inject SQL code into the search term, allowing them to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential for complete database compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions. Avoid dynamically constructing SQL queries from user input. Implement input validation and sanitization. Follow secure coding practices for database interactions.
