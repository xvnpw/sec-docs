## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Feed Processing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_feed_processing.md)

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Feed Content:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious RSS feed containing JavaScript code.
    *   **Critical Node: Target Vulnerable Rendering Logic in FreshRSS:** FreshRSS fails to properly sanitize the HTML content of the feed, allowing the malicious JavaScript to be rendered and executed in the user's browser.
    *   **Consequences:**  Account takeover (session hijacking), redirection to malicious sites, data theft.

*   **Feed Bomb (Exponential Entity Expansion):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious XML feed with deeply nested entities.
    *   **Critical Node: Trigger Exponential Expansion During Parsing:** When FreshRSS parses the XML, the nested entities cause the XML parser to exponentially expand the entities, consuming excessive memory and CPU resources.
    *   **Consequences:** Denial of Service (DoS), making the application unavailable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in FreshRSS Configuration/Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_freshrss_configurationmanagement.md)

*   **Default Credentials or Weak Credentials:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The FreshRSS instance is installed with default credentials that are not changed, or users choose weak, easily guessable passwords.
    *   **Critical Node: Default Credentials or Weak Credentials:** The attacker uses these credentials to gain access to the FreshRSS administrative panel.
    *   **Critical Node: Compromise Application Through FreshRSS Management Features:** Once logged in, the attacker leverages administrative functionalities (e.g., adding malicious feeds, modifying settings) to compromise the application.
    *   **Consequences:** Full control over FreshRSS, potential for application compromise, data manipulation.

*   **Insecure Permissions or Access Control:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** File permissions on the FreshRSS installation directory are misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Critical Node: Gain Access to Sensitive FreshRSS Files (e.g., configuration, database):** The attacker gains access to sensitive files containing configuration details (database credentials, API keys) or the database itself.
    *   **Consequences:** Data breach, ability to modify FreshRSS configuration and potentially gain access to the underlying system.

*   **Vulnerabilities in FreshRSS Plugins/Extensions (If Applicable):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** A user installs a vulnerable third-party plugin for FreshRSS.
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities within the Plugin Code:** The attacker exploits a security vulnerability present in the plugin's code (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution).
    *   **Consequences:** Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability, ranging from XSS to full application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in FreshRSS Update Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_freshrss_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Compromised Update Server:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the official FreshRSS update server infrastructure.
    *   **Critical Node: Attacker Gains Control of the Official FreshRSS Update Server:** The attacker gains control over the server that distributes updates for FreshRSS.
    *   **Consequences:**  Distribution of malicious updates to all FreshRSS instances, leading to widespread compromise of applications using FreshRSS. This is a supply chain attack.
