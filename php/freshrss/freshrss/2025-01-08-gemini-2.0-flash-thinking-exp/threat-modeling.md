# Threat Model Analysis for freshrss/freshrss

## Threat: [Malicious Feed Content Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_feed_content_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious RSS/Atom feed containing specific XML elements or processing instructions that exploit vulnerabilities **within FreshRSS's** XML parsing logic or the libraries it utilizes. When FreshRSS fetches and parses this feed, the malicious content triggers code execution on the server hosting FreshRSS.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the FreshRSS server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, install malware, or pivot to other systems on the network.
*   **Affected Component:** Feed parsing module/library **within FreshRSS**.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Utilize secure and regularly updated XML parsing libraries **within the FreshRSS project**. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all feed content before parsing **within FreshRSS's codebase**. Consider running the feed parsing process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges **as part of FreshRSS's architecture**. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of loaded resources **within FreshRSS's user interface**.

## Threat: [Malicious Feed Content Leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/malicious_feed_content_leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious RSS/Atom feed containing links or embedded resources that force the FreshRSS server to make requests to internal or external resources **due to how FreshRSS handles URLs in feeds**. This could be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or perform actions on external systems on behalf of the server.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of internal network infrastructure, access to sensitive internal services, potential for further attacks on internal systems, or abuse of external services.
*   **Affected Component:** Feed fetching and URL handling **within FreshRSS's** feed processing module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict URL validation and sanitization for URLs found in feed content **within FreshRSS's codebase**. Use a whitelist approach for allowed protocols and domains for outbound requests initiated by FreshRSS. Consider using a dedicated library or service to proxy and filter outbound requests **integrated into FreshRSS**.

## Threat: [Feed Sanitization Bypass Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/feed_sanitization_bypass_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious content within an RSS/Atom feed that bypasses **FreshRSS's** sanitization mechanisms. When a user views this feed within FreshRSS, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the FreshRSS interface, or other client-side attacks targeting users of the application.
*   **Affected Component:** Feed sanitization module/function **within FreshRSS's** user interface rendering process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust and regularly updated HTML sanitization libraries **within the FreshRSS project**. Utilize a whitelist approach for allowed HTML tags and attributes **in FreshRSS's sanitization logic**. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which resources can be loaded **within FreshRSS's user interface**. Regularly review and test the sanitization logic for bypasses **within the FreshRSS codebase**.

## Threat: [Database Manipulation via FreshRSS-Specific Logic Flaws](./threats/database_manipulation_via_freshrss-specific_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** While excluding generic SQL injection, vulnerabilities in how FreshRSS constructs and executes database queries related to feed data manipulation (e.g., marking articles as read, categorizing feeds) could be exploited to access or modify data beyond the intended scope. This focuses on flaws **in FreshRSS's** data access layer logic.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to or modification of user data, potential for privilege escalation within the application, or data corruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Data access layer, specific functions related to feed and article management **within FreshRSS**.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions **within FreshRSS's codebase**. Enforce strict input validation for any data used in database queries **by FreshRSS**. Conduct security audits of the data access layer **of FreshRSS**.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Mechanism Leading to Malicious Updates](./threats/insecure_update_mechanism_leading_to_malicious_updates.md)

*   **Description:** If **FreshRSS's** update mechanism does not properly verify the authenticity and integrity of update packages, an attacker could potentially inject malicious updates that, when applied, compromise the application and the server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the FreshRSS server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or install malware.
*   **Affected Component:** **FreshRSS's** update mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement a secure update mechanism **within FreshRSS** that includes cryptographic signing of update packages and verification of signatures before applying updates. Use HTTPS for downloading updates **within the FreshRSS update process**.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in FreshRSS Extensions/Plugins (If Applicable)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_freshrss_extensionsplugins__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:** If FreshRSS supports extensions or plugins, vulnerabilities within these extensions (developed by third parties or the core team) could introduce security risks. These vulnerabilities could range from XSS to RCE, depending on the extension's functionality and the security practices followed during its development. This is a direct result of **FreshRSS's** plugin architecture.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability within the extension, potentially leading to RCE, XSS, data breaches, or DoS.
*   **Affected Component:** Extension/plugin system **within FreshRSS** and the specific vulnerable extension.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can be Critical or High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement a secure plugin API with clear security guidelines for extension developers **within the FreshRSS project**. Establish a process for reviewing and vetting extensions before they are made available **through FreshRSS's extension management**. Provide mechanisms for users to report potentially malicious extensions **within FreshRSS**.
