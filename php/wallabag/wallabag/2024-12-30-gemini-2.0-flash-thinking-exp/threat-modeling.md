### High and Critical Wallabag Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized by Wallabag. This could occur through various user input points or even through manipulated data during article fetching or import *within Wallabag's code*.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data within the Wallabag database. This could lead to data breaches, data corruption, account manipulation, or even gaining control over the database managed by Wallabag.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database interaction layer within Wallabag (likely within various modules handling data input and processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions *within Wallabag's codebase*.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data *within Wallabag's code*.
        *   Adopt an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides built-in protection against SQL injection *within Wallabag's development practices*.
        *   Regularly perform static and dynamic code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities *in Wallabag's code*.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Article Fetching
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate Wallabag's article fetching functionality to make requests to internal network resources or external services that Wallabag should not have access to. This could be achieved by providing a malicious URL to save *and Wallabag's fetching mechanism doesn't prevent this*.
    *   **Impact:** Potential to access internal services, databases, or APIs within the network where Wallabag is hosted. This could lead to information disclosure, denial of service attacks against internal resources, or even the execution of arbitrary code on internal systems *due to Wallabag's actions*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Article fetching module/functionality *within Wallabag*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed protocols and domains for article fetching *within Wallabag's code*.
        *   Sanitize and validate URLs provided for article saving *within Wallabag's input handling*.
        *   Use a dedicated service or library for making external requests that provides SSRF protection *integrated into Wallabag's fetching mechanism*.

*   **Threat:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Malicious Article Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the content of a saved article. When other users view this article *through Wallabag*, the malicious script could execute in their browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the Wallabag interface, or perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user *within the context of the Wallabag application*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Article rendering and display functionality *within Wallabag*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust HTML sanitization and escaping when displaying article content *within Wallabag's rendering logic*.
        *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources *configured by Wallabag*.
        *   Regularly review and update sanitization libraries *used by Wallabag*.

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass or Weaknesses
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Wallabag's authentication mechanism to bypass login procedures or gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This could involve flaws in password reset functionality, session management, or cookie handling *within Wallabag's code*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts, allowing attackers to access, modify, or delete user data, and potentially use the account to further compromise the system *through Wallabag*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication and session management modules *within Wallabag*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies *within Wallabag's user management*.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) *as a feature of Wallabag*.
        *   Securely handle session cookies (e.g., using HttpOnly and Secure flags) *within Wallabag's session management*.
        *   Regularly review and test the authentication and authorization mechanisms *in Wallabag's code*.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts *within Wallabag's authentication logic*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Handling of API Tokens
    *   **Description:** If API tokens are not generated, stored, or transmitted securely *by Wallabag*, an attacker could intercept or obtain valid tokens, allowing them to access the Wallabag API on behalf of legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data and the ability to perform actions through the API, such as reading, creating, modifying, or deleting articles *via Wallabag's API*.
    *   **Affected Component:** API authentication and authorization mechanisms *within Wallabag*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Generate cryptographically secure and unpredictable API tokens *within Wallabag's token generation*.
        *   Store API tokens securely (e.g., hashed and salted in the database) *by Wallabag*.
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all API communication *as a requirement for using Wallabag's API*.
        *   Implement token expiration and rotation mechanisms *within Wallabag's API management*.
        *   Provide users with the ability to revoke API tokens *through Wallabag's interface or API*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Update Mechanisms
    *   **Description:** If the process for updating Wallabag itself is not secure, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code during an update *provided by the Wallabag project*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Wallabag instance, potentially leading to data breaches, remote code execution, and other severe consequences *affecting the Wallabag application*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Update mechanism *within Wallabag*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure updates are downloaded over HTTPS from trusted sources *by Wallabag's update process*.
        *   Verify the integrity of update packages using cryptographic signatures *by Wallabag's update process*.
        *   Implement a rollback mechanism in case of failed or malicious updates *within Wallabag's update functionality*.
