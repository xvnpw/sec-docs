# Attack Surface Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through User-Provided Article Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_user-provided_article_content.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts injected into article content are executed in other users' browsers when they view the saved article.
    *   **How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag fetches and renders content from external websites. If it doesn't properly sanitize this content before storing and displaying it, it becomes vulnerable to XSS. This is a direct function of Wallabag's core purpose.
    *   **Example:** A user saves an article from a malicious website containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views this article in Wallabag, the alert box pops up, demonstrating the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the Wallabag interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided content, especially when rendering fetched article content. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Article Fetching](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_article_fetching.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the Wallabag server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    *   **How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag fetches article content based on URLs provided by users. If not properly validated, an attacker can manipulate this to target internal services or external websites. This is a direct consequence of Wallabag's article saving functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL like `http://localhost:6379/` when saving an article. The Wallabag server attempts to fetch content from this internal Redis instance, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing manipulation of the service.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, information disclosure, denial of service against internal or external targets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict URL validation and sanitization for article fetching. Use a whitelist of allowed protocols and domains. Consider using a separate service or proxy for fetching external content. Disable or restrict redirects during fetching.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious File Uploads during Import](./attack_surfaces/malicious_file_uploads_during_import.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files through the import functionality, potentially leading to code execution or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag allows importing articles from various formats (e.g., Pocket, Instapaper exports). If the parsing logic for these formats is vulnerable, malicious files can be exploited. This is a direct risk introduced by Wallabag's import feature.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious Pocket export file that exploits a vulnerability in the XML parsing library used by Wallabag, leading to remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust file validation and sanitization for all imported files. Use secure parsing libraries and keep them updated. Consider sandboxing the import process. Limit the file size and type of allowed import files.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Annotations and Tags](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_annotations_and_tags.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts injected into annotations or tags are executed in other users' browsers when they view the annotated or tagged content.
    *   **How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag allows users to add annotations and tags to articles. If these inputs are not properly sanitized, they can be vectors for stored XSS. This is a direct risk stemming from Wallabag's annotation and tagging features.
    *   **Example:** A user adds an annotation containing `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` to an article. When another user views this article, the script executes.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the Wallabag interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided annotations and tags. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the API authentication or authorization mechanisms allow unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag provides an API for programmatic access. If the API authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth) or authorization checks are flawed, attackers can bypass security controls. This is a direct vulnerability related to Wallabag's API implementation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in the API key generation process, allowing them to generate valid API keys for other users and access their data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong and secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Enforce proper authorization checks for all API endpoints. Use secure storage for API keys. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks. Regularly review and audit API security.
