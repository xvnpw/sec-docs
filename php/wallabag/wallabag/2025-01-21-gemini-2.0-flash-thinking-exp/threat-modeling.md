# Threat Model Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Article Saving](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_article_saving.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious website containing scripts (JavaScript), iframes, or other harmful content. A Wallabag user saves an article from this website. Wallabag fetches and stores this content. When the user views the saved article within Wallabag, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting them to phishing sites, or performing other actions on their behalf. In a multi-user instance, this could potentially affect other users viewing the same maliciously saved article.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks leading to session hijacking, information disclosure, defacement of the Wallabag interface, or redirection to malicious sites. In multi-user scenarios, potential compromise of other user accounts.

**Affected Component:** Article saving functionality, specifically the modules responsible for fetching and processing external web content and rendering saved articles.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from external websites during the article saving process.
* Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
* Employ context-aware output encoding when rendering article content to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
* Consider using a sandboxed iframe or a dedicated rendering engine for displaying external content to isolate potential threats.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Article Fetching](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_article_fetching.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks a Wallabag user into saving an article from a URL controlled by the attacker. This URL points to an internal resource or service accessible by the Wallabag server but not directly by the user. When Wallabag attempts to fetch the article, it makes a request to this internal resource, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing the attacker to interact with internal services.

**Impact:** Access to internal network resources, potential for information disclosure about internal infrastructure, ability to interact with internal services (e.g., databases, other applications) leading to further exploitation.

**Affected Component:** Article saving functionality, specifically the module responsible for fetching content from URLs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a strict allow-list of allowed protocols and domains for article fetching.
* Sanitize and validate user-provided URLs to prevent manipulation.
* Disable or restrict the ability to follow redirects during article fetching.
* Consider using a separate network segment or a proxy server for fetching external content to limit the Wallabag server's access to internal resources.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Wallabag-Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_wallabag-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in Wallabag's authentication mechanism (e.g., a vulnerability in session management, password reset functionality, or a weakness in the login process itself) to gain unauthorized access to user accounts without knowing the correct credentials.

**Impact:** Complete account takeover, access to saved articles and personal information, ability to modify or delete user data. In multi-user instances, potential access to multiple accounts.

**Affected Component:** User authentication and session management modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly review and audit the authentication codebase for vulnerabilities.
* Implement strong password policies and enforce their use.
* Utilize secure session management practices, including HTTP-only and secure flags for cookies.
* Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
* Stay up-to-date with security patches and updates released by the Wallabag development team.

## Threat: [Authorization Flaws in Multi-User Instances](./threats/authorization_flaws_in_multi-user_instances.md)

**Description:** In a multi-user Wallabag instance, an attacker exploits a flaw in the authorization logic that allows them to access, modify, or delete articles or settings belonging to other users, even without having their credentials. This could be due to incorrect permission checks or vulnerabilities in how access control is implemented.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to other users' data, potential for data manipulation or deletion, privacy violations.

**Affected Component:** Authorization and access control modules, particularly those related to multi-user functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust and granular access control mechanisms to ensure users can only access their own data.
* Thoroughly test authorization logic to identify and fix any vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review and audit access control configurations.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Wallabag's configuration files (e.g., `parameters.yml`, environment variables) which may contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys for external services, or other secrets.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Wallabag instance, potential access to the database and connected services, ability to impersonate the Wallabag instance.

**Affected Component:** Configuration management and file handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store sensitive information securely, preferably using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system.
* Ensure that configuration files are not publicly accessible through the web server.
* Restrict file system permissions on configuration files to only allow access by the Wallabag application user.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in code.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Article Metadata leading to Stored XSS](./threats/insecure_handling_of_article_metadata_leading_to_stored_xss.md)

**Description:** Wallabag stores metadata about saved articles (e.g., title, author, description). If this metadata is not properly sanitized or escaped before being displayed, an attacker could craft a malicious website with malicious scripts embedded in these metadata fields. When a user saves this article and views it in Wallabag, the unsanitized metadata is rendered, leading to stored XSS.

**Impact:** Persistent cross-site scripting attacks, potential for account takeover, information disclosure, or defacement whenever the affected article is viewed.

**Affected Component:** Article metadata handling and rendering modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all article metadata fields.
* Use context-aware output encoding when rendering metadata to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Wallabag API (if enabled)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_wallabag_api__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If Wallabag's API is enabled, vulnerabilities in its endpoints, authentication mechanisms (e.g., API key management), or input validation could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions, access sensitive data, or manipulate user information.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to user accounts, ability to modify or delete data, potential for denial of service.

**Affected Component:** API endpoints and related authentication/authorization modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
* Thoroughly validate all input received by the API.
* Follow secure API development best practices.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
* Regularly review and audit the API codebase for vulnerabilities.
