# Threat Model Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Wallabag's Installation Wizard](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_wallabag's_installation_wizard.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially access the Wallabag installation wizard if it is not properly locked down after the initial setup. This could allow them to reconfigure Wallabag through its built-in functionality, potentially gaining administrative access or overwriting existing data.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Wallabag instance, including access to all saved articles and user data, potential for data deletion or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Installation Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure the installation wizard is disabled or access is restricted after the initial setup is complete. This often involves deleting or renaming the installation directory or file.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Article Saving](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_article_saving.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide a malicious URL to Wallabag's article saving functionality, causing Wallabag's server to make requests to internal resources or external services that it should not have access to. This is a vulnerability within Wallabag's core functionality for fetching and processing external content.

**Impact:** Access to internal systems, potential data breaches from internal services, denial of service of internal resources.

**Affected Component:** Article Saving Functionality

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on URLs provided for article saving within Wallabag. Use a whitelist approach for allowed protocols (e.g., `http`, `https`). Prevent Wallabag from following redirects to internal networks. Consider using a dedicated service for fetching and sanitizing external content.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__through_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Wallabag relies on various third-party libraries and components. If any of these dependencies have known remote code execution vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these flaws within the context of the Wallabag application to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Wallabag.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting Wallabag, allowing the attacker to control the system, access sensitive data, or launch further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Dependency Management (Composer, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update Wallabag and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Implement a process for monitoring security advisories for Wallabag's dependencies and applying patches promptly.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Article Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_article_content.md)

**Description:** If Wallabag fails to properly sanitize the content of saved articles through its internal processing mechanisms, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a website, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users viewing that article through Wallabag.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, theft of sensitive information from users interacting with the affected article.

**Affected Component:** Article Rendering/Display Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust server-side sanitization of article content before storing it in the database within Wallabag's code. Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the risk of XSS. Regularly review and update the sanitization libraries used by Wallabag.

## Threat: [Insecure API Access Control](./threats/insecure_api_access_control.md)

**Description:** If Wallabag's API endpoints, which are part of its core functionality, lack proper authentication or authorization checks, an attacker could potentially access and manipulate user data, create new users, delete articles, or perform other administrative actions without proper credentials through Wallabag's own API.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data, data manipulation, account takeover, potential for denial of service.

**Affected Component:** API Endpoints, Authentication Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce strong authentication for all Wallabag API endpoints. Implement proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access and modify data they are permitted to within Wallabag's API. Use secure authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion during Article Fetching](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion_during_article_fetching.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide links to extremely large files or websites that require significant processing power for Wallabag's article fetching functionality to handle, potentially overloading the Wallabag instance and making it unavailable to legitimate users. This is a vulnerability in how Wallabag manages resources when fetching external content.

**Impact:** Service disruption, inability for users to access or save articles.

**Affected Component:** Article Fetching Functionality

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement timeouts and resource limits for article fetching within Wallabag. Implement rate limiting on article saving requests directed at Wallabag. Consider using a queue system for processing article fetching to prevent overwhelming the server.
