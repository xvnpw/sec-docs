# Attack Surface Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the Wallabag server to make requests to unintended locations.

**How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag fetches content from user-provided URLs when saving articles.

**Example:** A malicious user provides a URL pointing to an internal service when saving an article. Wallabag's server attempts to access this internal service.

**Impact:** Access to internal services, port scanning of internal networks, potential for further exploitation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for URLs.
*   **Developers:** Use allow-lists of allowed protocols and domains.
*   **Developers:** Consider using a dedicated library for URL parsing and validation.
*   **Developers:** Disable or restrict the use of URL schemes prone to abuse (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`).
*   **Users:** Be cautious about the sources of URLs you save to Wallabag.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in Wallabag's API authentication or authorization mechanisms can allow unauthorized access to user data or actions.

**How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag provides an API for interacting with the application. Vulnerabilities in how this API verifies user identity and permissions can be exploited.

**Example:** A flaw in the API token generation or validation process could allow an attacker to forge or guess valid API tokens. Missing authorization checks on API endpoints could allow unauthorized actions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data, modification or deletion of articles, potential account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
*   **Developers:** Ensure proper authorization checks are in place for all API endpoints.
*   **Developers:** Securely store and handle API tokens.
*   **Developers:** Regularly audit API endpoints for vulnerabilities.
*   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on API requests.
*   **Users:** Protect your API tokens and do not share them with untrusted parties.
*   **Users:** Be cautious about using third-party applications that require access to your Wallabag API.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Import Functionality](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_import_functionality.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how Wallabag handles imported data can lead to security issues.

**How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag allows users to import articles from various formats. If the parsing and processing of these import files are not secure, malicious files could be crafted.

**Example:** A malicious user crafts an import file containing malicious code. When Wallabag parses this file, the code could be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all imported data.
*   **Developers:** Use well-vetted and secure libraries for parsing import formats.
*   **Developers:** Consider sandboxing the import process.
*   **Developers:** Implement file type checks and avoid relying solely on file extensions.
*   **Users:** Only import files from trusted sources.
*   **Users:** Be cautious about importing files from unknown or suspicious origins.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Administrative Interface](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_administrative_interface.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in the administrative interface can allow unauthorized users to gain control over the Wallabag instance.

**How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag provides an administrative interface for managing the application. If this interface is not properly secured, it can become a target.

**Example:** Missing authorization checks on administrative endpoints could allow a regular user to access administrative functionalities. CSRF vulnerabilities in the admin panel could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of an administrator.

**Impact:** Full control over the Wallabag instance, including user data and settings.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for all administrative endpoints.
*   **Developers:** Use anti-CSRF tokens to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
*   **Developers:** Regularly audit the administrative interface for vulnerabilities.
*   **Developers:** Limit access to the administrative interface to authorized users only.
*   **Developers:** Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts.
*   **Users:** Enable multi-factor authentication if available.
*   **Users:** Restrict access to the administrative interface to trusted individuals.
*   **Users:** Keep the Wallabag instance updated with the latest security patches.
