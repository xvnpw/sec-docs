Okay, let's create a design document for Wallabag, based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Wallabag is a self-hostable read-it-later application. It allows users to save web pages for later reading, similar to services like Pocket or Instapaper. The core business priorities appear to be:

*   Data Privacy: Providing users with full control over their data by allowing self-hosting. This contrasts with centralized services where user data is stored on third-party servers.
*   Open Source and Community Driven: The project is open source, fostering transparency and community contributions.
*   Accessibility and Usability: Offering a clean and user-friendly interface for saving and reading articles.
*   Extensibility: Supporting various integrations and import/export options.
*   Cost-Effectiveness: Offering a free alternative to paid read-it-later services.

Business Goals:

*   Provide a stable and reliable self-hosted application.
*   Maintain user data privacy and security.
*   Grow the user base and community.
*   Ensure long-term project sustainability.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or loss due to vulnerabilities in the application or misconfiguration by users.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents.
*   Lack of user adoption due to complexity or poor user experience.
*   Project abandonment due to lack of maintainer resources.
*   Legal issues related to copyright or data privacy regulations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Wallabag implements user authentication to protect user accounts and data. (Implemented in the application code, likely using Symfony's security component).
*   security control: Authorization: Access control mechanisms restrict users to their own data. (Implemented in the application code, likely using Symfony's security component).
*   security control: Input Validation: The application likely performs input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection. (Implemented in the application code, using Symfony's form validation and potentially other libraries).
*   security control: CSRF Protection: Symfony's built-in CSRF protection is likely used to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. (Enabled by default in Symfony).
*   security control: HTTPS Support: Wallabag can be configured to use HTTPS, encrypting communication between the user and the server. (Configuration-dependent, relies on the user setting up a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS termination).
*   security control: Regular Updates: The project receives regular updates, including security patches. (Visible in the GitHub repository).
*   security control: Dependency Management: Composer is used to manage dependencies, allowing for updates to address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Visible in the `composer.json` file).
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Wallabag can be configured with a CSP to mitigate XSS attacks. (Mentioned in documentation, implementation details vary).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Self-Hosting Responsibility: Users are responsible for securing their own server infrastructure, including operating system updates, firewall configuration, and database security.
*   accepted risk: Limited Security Audits: While the code is open source, there may not have been extensive formal security audits.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities: Despite dependency management, there's always a risk of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Implement 2FA to enhance account security.
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.
*   security control: Security Headers: Enforce security headers like HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular penetration testing and code reviews.
*   security control: Database Encryption: Offer an option to encrypt the database at rest.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies.
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
    *   Secure password reset mechanisms.
    *   Optional 2FA.
*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (if applicable).
    *   Strict separation of user data.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Whitelist-based validation where possible.
    *   Sanitization of all user inputs.
    *   Protection against XSS, SQL injection, and other common web vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Secure storage of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords).
    *   HTTPS enforcement.

## BUILD

Wallabag uses a combination of tools for building and packaging the application:

1.  Composer: For managing PHP dependencies.
2.  Make: For automating build tasks.
3.  Docker: For creating containerized releases.

Build Process:

```mermaid
graph LR
    developer["Developer"]
    source_code["Source Code\n(GitHub)"]
    composer["Composer"]
    make["Make"]
    docker["Docker"]
    docker_hub["Docker Hub"]
    artifacts["Build Artifacts\n(Docker Images)"]

    developer -- "Commits code" --> source_code
    source_code -- "Fetches dependencies" --> composer
    source_code -- "Runs build tasks" --> make
    make -- "Builds Docker images" --> docker
    docker -- "Pushes images" --> docker_hub
    docker_hub -- "Provides" --> artifacts
```

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Dependency Management: Composer ensures that dependencies are tracked and can be updated to address vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Build Automation: Make automates the build process, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: Containerization: Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment for the application, reducing the risk of environment-specific issues.
*   security control: (Recommended) SAST: Integrate a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool into the build process to scan for vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: (Recommended) SCA: Integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: (Recommended) Image Signing: Sign Docker images to ensure their integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Saving web pages: Users must be able to reliably save articles to Wallabag.
*   Reading web pages: Users must be able to access and read their saved articles.
*   Data synchronization: Data must be synchronized correctly between different devices and clients.
*   User account management: Users must be able to manage their accounts securely.

Data to Protect:

*   Saved articles (content and metadata): Sensitivity varies depending on the content saved by the user. Could range from public information to highly sensitive personal data.
*   User account information (username, password hash, email address): Sensitive personal data.
*   API keys (if used): Highly sensitive, as they grant access to the user's data.
*   Configuration files: May contain sensitive information like database credentials.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that need to be considered?
*   What is the expected user base size and growth rate? This can impact scalability requirements.
*   What is the tolerance for downtime? This will influence the deployment architecture and redundancy requirements.
*   Are there any plans for features that might introduce new security risks (e.g., user collaboration, public sharing of articles)?
*   What level of support is provided to users for security-related issues?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure and private self-hosted read-it-later solution.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Users are responsible for securing their own server infrastructure. The project aims to provide secure application code, but cannot guarantee the security of the user's environment.
*   DESIGN: The Docker-based deployment model is a suitable and common choice for Wallabag. The application architecture follows standard web application patterns.
