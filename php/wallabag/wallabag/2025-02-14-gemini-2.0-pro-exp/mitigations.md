# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhanced Content Sanitization (Within Wallabag)](./mitigation_strategies/enhanced_content_sanitization__within_wallabag_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement an additional layer of HTML sanitization *after* Wallabag's built-in processing, directly within the Wallabag codebase.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sanitization Point:** Locate the precise code within Wallabag (controllers, views, or models) where the extracted content is prepared for display to the user. This is *after* `graby` and other internal parsing.
    2.  **Integrate Sanitization Library:** Add a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., HTML Purifier) as a project dependency using Composer: `composer require ezyang/htmlpurifier`.
    3.  **Configure Sanitizer:** Within the Wallabag code, configure the sanitizer with a strict whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes. Start very restrictively, allowing only basic formatting and progressively adding elements as needed. Prioritize blocking:
        *   `<script>` tags (completely remove).
        *   `<iframe>` tags (restrict or remove).
        *   Event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, etc.).
        *   Potentially malicious attributes (`style` with dangerous CSS).
        *   External resources (limit `src` to trusted domains).
    4.  **Apply Sanitization:** Modify the Wallabag code to pass the extracted content *through* the sanitizer *before* it's rendered in the user interface. This is a crucial code modification.
    5.  **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test the sanitization with various inputs, including known XSS payloads and edge cases, to ensure effectiveness.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Malicious JavaScript injected into saved content could execute in other users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (via complex parsing exploits):** (Severity: Critical) - While less likely, vulnerabilities in parsing libraries *could* lead to RCE. Enhanced sanitization reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Information Disclosure (through crafted HTML/CSS):** (Severity: Medium) - Malicious content could attempt to leak information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of stored XSS by adding a defense-in-depth layer.
    *   **RCE:** Reduces the likelihood of RCE by limiting the complexity of HTML reaching parsing libraries.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Wallabag has built-in sanitization via `graby`, but it's not a dedicated security-focused sanitizer like HTML Purifier.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A dedicated, post-processing sanitization step using a library like HTML Purifier is *not* standard and requires code modification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for Displayed Content (Within Wallabag)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_content_security_policy__csp__for_displayed_content__within_wallabag_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a strict CSP *within Wallabag's code* specifically for pages displaying saved article content.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Display Controllers/Templates:** Pinpoint the Wallabag controllers and/or templates responsible for rendering the *view* of saved articles.
    2.  **Craft CSP Header (in Code):** Within the identified controller or template, programmatically construct the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header. Start with a very restrictive policy:
        *   `default-src 'none';`
        *   `script-src 'self';` (or use nonces/hashes for stricter control).
        *   `style-src 'self';`
        *   `img-src 'self' data:;` (plus trusted CDNs if needed).
        *   `connect-src 'self';`
        *   `frame-src 'none';` (or be *extremely* careful with iframes).
        *   `object-src 'none';`
        *   `base-uri 'self';`
    3.  **Add Header to Response:** Use Wallabag's framework mechanisms (e.g., Symfony's response object) to add the `Content-Security-Policy` header to the HTTP response *before* it's sent to the browser. This is a code modification.
    4.  **Test and Refine:** Thoroughly test the CSP using browser developer tools. Adjust as needed. Use `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` during development.
    5.  **Reporting Endpoint (Optional):** Consider setting up a reporting endpoint (`report-uri` or `report-to`) within Wallabag to receive CSP violation reports.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Prevents execution of injected JavaScript, even if it bypasses sanitization.
    *   **Clickjacking:** (Severity: Medium) - `frame-ancestors` (or `frame-src 'none'`) prevents embedding in malicious iframes.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** (Severity: Medium) - `connect-src` limits where data can be sent.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Strong defense against XSS.
    *   **Clickjacking:** Prevents clickjacking.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Wallabag has a CSP for the *application*, but not a separate, stricter one for *displayed content*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A dedicated, stricter CSP for displayed content, implemented *within the Wallabag code*, is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Code Modification)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_two-factor_authentication__2fa___code_modification_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Modify Wallabag's code to *require* 2FA for all users.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Authentication Logic:** Find the code responsible for user authentication and login (likely in controllers or authentication-related classes).
    2.  **Modify Logic:** Add a check to *enforce* 2FA.  This means that *every* user, upon successful password authentication, *must* also provide a valid 2FA code before being granted access.  This is a code change to the authentication flow.  The logic should:
        *   Check if 2FA is enabled globally.
        *   Check if the user has 2FA enabled.
        *   If both are true, *require* a valid 2FA code.
        *   If the 2FA code is invalid or missing, deny access.
    3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases, such as account recovery if a user loses their 2FA device.  Implement secure recovery mechanisms.
    4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the modified authentication flow to ensure it works correctly and cannot be bypassed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Phishing:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Weak Passwords:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   All: Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even with a compromised password.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Wallabag *supports* 2FA.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The ability to *enforce* 2FA for *all* users likely requires a code modification.  It must be *mandatory*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Security - Rate Limiting (Within Wallabag)](./mitigation_strategies/api_security_-_rate_limiting__within_wallabag_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement rate limiting for API requests *within the Wallabag application code*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify API Controllers:** Locate the controllers responsible for handling API requests.
    2.  **Integrate Rate Limiting Library:** Add a rate-limiting library as a dependency (e.g., a Symfony rate limiter component or a standalone library). Use Composer.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limiter:** Configure the rate limiter within the Wallabag code.  Define limits based on:
        *   API key (or user ID).
        *   Time period (e.g., requests per minute/hour).
        *   Endpoint (potentially different limits for different API methods).
    4.  **Apply Rate Limiting:** Modify the API controllers to apply the rate limiting logic *before* processing the API request.  This is a code modification.
        *   Check if the request exceeds the limit.
        *   If exceeded, return an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`).
        *   Include informative headers (e.g., `Retry-After`).
    5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the rate limiting to ensure it works correctly and cannot be easily bypassed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** (Severity: High) - While authentication is primary, rate limiting adds a layer of defense.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (on API Keys):** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via API:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Data Breaches via API:** (Severity: High) - Rate limiting can slow down data exfiltration attempts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force:** Makes brute-force attacks much harder.
    *   **DoS:** Prevents DoS attacks via the API.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Can slow down data exfiltration.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Wallabag has API authentication.
    *   Basic input validation is likely present.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Robust rate limiting *within the Wallabag application code* is likely missing and requires implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Risky Features (Code Modification)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_risky_features__code_modification_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** If PDF or Epub export features are not required, disable them by removing or commenting out the relevant code within Wallabag.

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Feature Code:** Locate the code responsible for PDF and Epub generation within Wallabag's codebase. This will likely involve controllers, services, and potentially external library calls.
    2. **Disable Functionality:**
        *   **Option 1 (Recommended):** Comment out or remove the code that handles the export functionality. This prevents the code from being executed.
        *   **Option 2 (Less Ideal):** Modify the code to return an error or a "feature disabled" message if the export functionality is requested. This is less secure, as the underlying code still exists.
    3. **Remove Dependencies (If Possible):** If the disabled features rely on external libraries (e.g., for PDF generation), remove those libraries from Wallabag's dependencies (using Composer) to reduce the attack surface.
    4. **Update Configuration (If Necessary):** If there are configuration options related to the disabled features, update them to reflect the disabled state.
    5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the changes to ensure that the disabled features are no longer accessible and that no other functionality is broken.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via External Libraries:** (Severity: Critical) - Vulnerabilities in libraries used for PDF/Epub generation could be exploited to achieve RCE.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: High) - Maliciously crafted input could cause the export features to consume excessive resources.
    * **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: Medium) - Vulnerabilities in the export libraries could potentially lead to information disclosure.

* **Impact:**
    * **RCE:** Eliminates the risk of RCE through vulnerabilities in the disabled features' libraries.
    * **DoS:** Reduces the risk of DoS attacks targeting the export functionality.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Reduces the risk.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Wallabag includes PDF and Epub export functionality.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Disabling these features requires code modification and dependency management.
