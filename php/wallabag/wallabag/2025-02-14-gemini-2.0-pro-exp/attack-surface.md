# Attack Surface Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Attack Surface: [Content Parsing and Extraction](./attack_surfaces/content_parsing_and_extraction.md)

*   **Description:** Wallabag fetches and parses content from arbitrary websites, making it vulnerable to attacks embedded within that content. This is the most critical attack vector.
*   **How Wallabag Contributes:** This is Wallabag's *core functionality*. It relies on its own logic and external libraries to parse HTML, extract text, and handle images.  The interaction between Wallabag's code and these libraries is the key area of concern.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a webpage with specially crafted, deeply nested HTML tags that exploit a vulnerability in Wallabag's handling of the parsed DOM tree, leading to a denial-of-service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE), High (for SSRF, DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly update *all* parsing libraries (Readability.php, image processing libraries, etc.) to the latest versions.  Prioritize security updates.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to parsing libraries. This includes checking file types, sizes, content structure, and *specifically* looking for patterns known to exploit common parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Thoroughly review and test Wallabag's code that interacts with the parsing libraries.  Focus on how the parsed data is used and handled within Wallabag.  Look for potential buffer overflows, integer overflows, or logic errors.
        *   Explore sandboxing the parsing process (e.g., using containers or separate processes) to isolate it from the main Wallabag application.  This limits the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory, processing time, maximum recursion depth) for parsing to prevent DoS attacks.
        *   Use memory-safe languages or libraries for parsing whenever possible.  If using PHP, ensure strict type checking and avoid unsafe functions.
        *   Perform fuzz testing on the parsing components to identify unexpected vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Embedded Resource Handling](./attack_surfaces/embedded_resource_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Wallabag processes embedded resources (images) within saved articles, exposing it to vulnerabilities in resource handling libraries *and* Wallabag's own code for managing these resources.
*   **How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag downloads, stores, and potentially resizes/processes images.  The code that handles these operations is directly part of Wallabag.
*   **Example:** A malicious image file, seemingly a valid JPEG, is embedded.  Wallabag's code, while attempting to determine the image dimensions, encounters an integer overflow, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially RCE.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE), High (for DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Keep image processing libraries updated (as above).
        *   *Thoroughly* review and test Wallabag's code that handles image downloading, storage, and processing.  Look for potential buffer overflows, integer overflows, and logic errors.
        *   Validate image dimensions, file sizes, and file types *before* any processing, using Wallabag's own validation logic, *not* relying solely on the image library.
        *   Strip metadata from images to reduce the attack surface.
        *   Consider using a separate, isolated service for image processing, further limiting the impact of a compromise.
        *   Implement strict resource limits for image processing.

## Attack Surface: [Import Functionality](./attack_surfaces/import_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** Wallabag's import feature parses data from various formats, creating an opportunity for malicious input to exploit vulnerabilities in the import logic.
*   **How Wallabag Contributes:** The import process is entirely handled by Wallabag's code, which parses the specific file formats of supported import sources.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious Pocket export file containing specially formatted HTML or JSON that, when parsed by Wallabag's import routines, triggers a buffer overflow or a logic error, leading to RCE or data corruption.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (for RCE and Data Corruption).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly validate the structure and content of *all* import files *before* processing them. This includes strict schema validation and checking for unexpected data types, sizes, and structures.  Do *not* assume the import file is well-formed.
        *   Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid or malicious import data.  Fail securely and prevent any partial import that could leave the system in an inconsistent state.
        *   Consider sandboxing the import process to limit the impact of any vulnerabilities.
        *   Use a well-tested and secure parsing library for each supported import format.  Avoid writing custom parsers if possible.
        *   Perform fuzz testing on the import functionality with various malformed input files.

## Attack Surface: [Annotations Feature](./attack_surfaces/annotations_feature.md)

*   **Description:** User-provided annotations, handled directly by Wallabag, could contain malicious content intended to exploit vulnerabilities in the rendering or storage of annotations.
*   **How Wallabag Contributes:** Wallabag's code is responsible for storing, retrieving, and displaying annotations. The handling of user input within this process is the key concern.
*   **Example:** A user adds an annotation containing carefully crafted HTML that bypasses Wallabag's sanitization routines. When another user views the annotated article, this malicious HTML is rendered, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement *very* strict input validation and sanitization for all annotation content.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only a very limited set of safe HTML tags and attributes (if any).
        *   Use a robust HTML sanitization library that is specifically designed to prevent XSS attacks.
        *   Encode annotation content appropriately when displaying it to prevent XSS.  Context-aware encoding is crucial.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further restrict the execution of scripts and mitigate the impact of any potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly review and test the annotation handling code, focusing on potential XSS bypasses.
