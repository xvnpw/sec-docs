# Threat Model Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Threat: [Unauthorized Article Access via Authentication Bypass](./threats/unauthorized_article_access_via_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in Wallabag's user authentication process (e.g., a session management vulnerability, improper handling of password resets, or a bypass of the login form) to gain access to another user's account and their saved articles. The attacker might use techniques like session fixation, session hijacking, or brute-forcing weak passwords *specifically within Wallabag's authentication logic*.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to private articles, potential exposure of sensitive information contained within those articles, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `User` entity related functions, Authentication controllers (e.g., `src/Wallabag/UserBundle/Controller/SecurityController.php`, related authentication services, and session management components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure robust session management with secure, randomly generated session IDs, proper session expiration, and protection against session fixation/hijacking.
        *   Implement strong password policies and secure password storage (e.g., using bcrypt or Argon2).
        *   Thoroughly test the authentication flow, including edge cases and error handling.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an option.
        *   Regularly review and update authentication-related libraries and dependencies.

## Threat: [Article Data Exfiltration via API Vulnerability](./threats/article_data_exfiltration_via_api_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Wallabag's API (e.g., insufficient access control checks on API endpoints, improper input validation, or an information disclosure vulnerability) to retrieve articles belonging to other users or to extract sensitive information about the Wallabag installation. The attacker might craft malicious API requests to bypass intended restrictions.
    *   **Impact:**  Leakage of private article data, potential exposure of system configuration details, and compromise of user accounts.
    *   **Affected Component:** API controllers (e.g., `src/Wallabag/ApiBundle/Controller/`), API authentication mechanisms, and data serialization/deserialization logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control checks on all API endpoints, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
        *   Use API keys or OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization.
        *   Validate all API input thoroughly, including data types, lengths, and formats.
        *   Avoid exposing internal system details in API responses.
        *   Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent abuse.
        *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing of the API.

## Threat: [Plugin-Induced Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/plugin-induced_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker installs a malicious Wallabag plugin (or exploits a vulnerability in a legitimate plugin) that allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.  This could be achieved through insecure file uploads, command injection, or other vulnerabilities within the plugin's code.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to steal data, install malware, or use the server for other malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin system (`src/Wallabag/CoreBundle/DependencyInjection/Compiler/AddThemePass.php` and related plugin loading mechanisms), and the code of the vulnerable plugin itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a strict plugin vetting process, reviewing the code and reputation of plugins before allowing them to be installed.
        *   Use a plugin sandbox or containerization to isolate plugins from the core Wallabag application.
        *   Implement a plugin signing mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of plugins.
        *   Regularly update plugins to their latest versions.
        *   Provide a mechanism for users to report potentially malicious plugins.
        *   *Strongly* discourage the use of unofficial or unmaintained plugins.

## Threat: [Configuration Exposure via Misconfigured Debug Mode](./threats/configuration_exposure_via_misconfigured_debug_mode.md)

*   **Description:**  An administrator accidentally leaves Wallabag's debug mode enabled in a production environment.  This exposes sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or internal error messages, which an attacker can use to gain further access to the system.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive configuration data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Wallabag's configuration files (e.g., `app/config/config.yml`, `app/config/parameters.yml`, environment variables), and the web server configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable debug mode in production environments.
        *   Use environment variables to store sensitive configuration data, rather than hardcoding them in configuration files.
        *   Regularly review and audit the Wallabag configuration.
        *   Implement access controls to restrict access to configuration files.
        *   Use a separate, non-publicly accessible environment for development and testing.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Internal Communication](./threats/unencrypted_internal_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between Wallabag components (e.g., the web application and the database, or Wallabag and an external service like a Redis cache) occurs over unencrypted channels. An attacker with network access (e.g., on the same local network or through a compromised network device) can intercept this traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, article content) transmitted between components. Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components involved in inter-process communication: web server, database server, caching server, any external services used by Wallabag.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between Wallabag components.
        *   Use strong encryption protocols and ciphers.
        *   Configure database connections to use TLS/SSL.
        *   Verify certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   Regularly update cryptographic libraries.
