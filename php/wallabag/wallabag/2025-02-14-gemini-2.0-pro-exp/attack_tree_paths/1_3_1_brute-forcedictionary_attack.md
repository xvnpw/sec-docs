# Deep Analysis of Brute-Force/Dictionary Attack on Wallabag

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the threat of brute-force and dictionary attacks against user accounts within a Wallabag instance.  We will identify specific vulnerabilities, assess the likelihood and impact of successful attacks, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level mitigations already mentioned.  The ultimate goal is to provide the development team with the information needed to harden Wallabag against this common attack vector.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Authentication mechanisms:**  We will analyze Wallabag's user authentication process, including password storage, session management, and any related API endpoints.
*   **Existing security controls:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of any current measures in place to prevent brute-force attacks (e.g., rate limiting, account lockouts).
*   **Wallabag's codebase (from the provided repository):**  We will (hypothetically, as we don't have direct access here) examine relevant code sections for potential weaknesses that could be exploited.  This includes looking for areas where input validation might be insufficient or where error handling could leak information.
*   **Default configurations:** We will consider the security implications of Wallabag's default settings related to authentication.
*   **Third-party dependencies:** We will briefly consider if any authentication-related dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities.

This analysis *excludes* attacks that do not directly target the authentication process (e.g., XSS, SQL injection used to *bypass* authentication are out of scope for *this specific path*, though they would be relevant in a broader attack tree).  It also excludes physical security and social engineering attacks.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will refine the threat model for this specific attack, considering attacker motivations, capabilities, and potential targets within a Wallabag context.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  We will perform a hypothetical code review of relevant sections of the Wallabag codebase (from the GitHub repository) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will involve searching for patterns known to be associated with brute-force vulnerabilities.
3.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will examine the default configuration files and any administrative settings related to user authentication and security.
4.  **Dependency Analysis:** We will briefly review the project's dependencies (e.g., from `composer.json`) to identify any known vulnerabilities in authentication-related libraries.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies, prioritizing those with the highest impact and feasibility.
6. **Testing Recommendations:** We will provide recommendations for testing the effectiveness.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3.1 Brute-force/Dictionary Attack

### 4.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Motivation:**
    *   Gain access to saved articles (potentially sensitive or private information).
    *   Use the compromised account as a stepping stone for further attacks (e.g., if the Wallabag instance is hosted on a server with other services).
    *   Deface the Wallabag instance or disrupt its service.
    *   Use the compromised account to spread spam or phishing links (if Wallabag has features that allow sharing).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   **Low:**  Manual password guessing, using basic dictionary lists.
    *   **Medium:**  Using automated tools (e.g., Hydra, Burp Suite Intruder) with larger dictionary lists and some understanding of common password patterns.
    *   **High:**  Using sophisticated tools, custom wordlists tailored to the target, distributed attack infrastructure (botnets), and potentially exploiting other vulnerabilities to weaken authentication.
*   **Potential Targets:**
    *   Accounts with weak or default passwords.
    *   Administrator accounts (highest value target).
    *   Accounts of users known to have access to sensitive information.

### 4.2 Hypothetical Code Review (Based on common vulnerabilities)

Without direct access to the Wallabag codebase, we can only hypothesize about potential vulnerabilities.  However, we can look for common patterns that often lead to brute-force weaknesses:

*   **Insufficient Rate Limiting:**  The most critical vulnerability.  If Wallabag doesn't strictly limit the number of failed login attempts within a given timeframe (from a single IP address or globally), it's highly vulnerable.  We would look for:
    *   Lack of any rate-limiting logic in the authentication controller.
    *   Rate limiting that is easily bypassed (e.g., by changing IP addresses, using proxies, or manipulating session tokens).
    *   Rate limiting that only applies per-IP and not globally (allowing distributed brute-force attacks).
    *   Rate limiting that is too lenient (e.g., allowing hundreds of attempts per minute).
*   **Weak Account Lockout Mechanism:**  Even with rate limiting, an account lockout policy is crucial.  We would look for:
    *   No account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts.
    *   An easily bypassed lockout (e.g., by resetting the password via email without sufficient verification).
    *   A lockout that is too short (e.g., only a few minutes).
    *   Lack of logging or alerting for lockout events.
*   **Predictable Session Management:**  If session tokens are predictable or easily guessable, an attacker might be able to bypass authentication entirely.
*   **Information Leakage:**  Error messages that reveal too much information can aid an attacker.  For example:
    *   Different error messages for "invalid username" and "invalid password" (allowing username enumeration).
    *   Error messages that reveal internal server details.
*   **Lack of CAPTCHA or Similar Challenges:**  While not a primary defense, CAPTCHAs can add an extra layer of protection against automated attacks.
* **Password Reset Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in the password reset functionality can be exploited.
* **Lack of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** While not strictly a brute-force mitigation, the *absence* of 2FA significantly increases the risk.

### 4.3 Configuration Analysis

We would examine the following configuration settings:

*   **`app/config/parameters.yml` (or similar):**  Look for settings related to:
    *   `fosuserbundle` (if used for authentication) - check for rate limiting, lockout, and password complexity settings.
    *   Session timeout values.
    *   Any custom security settings.
*   **`.env` file:**  Check for any environment variables that might control security-related behavior.
*   **Web server configuration (e.g., Apache, Nginx):**  Look for any rate-limiting or security modules that could be configured at the web server level.

### 4.4 Dependency Analysis

We would examine `composer.json` for dependencies related to authentication and security, such as:

*   **`friendsofsymfony/user-bundle` (FOSUserBundle):**  A common Symfony bundle for user management.  We would check its version and look for any known vulnerabilities.
*   **Any other security-related bundles:**  (e.g., bundles for rate limiting, CAPTCHA, etc.).
*   **Symfony framework itself:** Ensure it's a supported and patched version.

### 4.5 Mitigation Recommendations

Based on the above analysis, we recommend the following mitigations, prioritized by impact and feasibility:

1.  **Robust Rate Limiting (High Priority):**
    *   Implement strict rate limiting at both the application level (within Wallabag's code) and the web server level (using modules like `mod_security` for Apache or `ngx_http_limit_req_module` for Nginx).
    *   Use a sliding window approach to track failed attempts.
    *   Limit attempts per IP address *and* globally (to mitigate distributed attacks).
    *   Consider using a dedicated rate-limiting service (e.g., Redis) for better performance and scalability.
    *   Log all rate-limiting events for monitoring and analysis.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**  Limit to 5 failed login attempts per IP address per 5 minutes, and 20 failed login attempts globally per hour.

2.  **Account Lockout (High Priority):**
    *   Implement account lockout after a small number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5-10 attempts).
    *   Lock accounts for a significant duration (e.g., 30 minutes to several hours, potentially increasing with repeated lockouts).
    *   Provide a secure and user-friendly way to unlock accounts (e.g., email verification with strong anti-automation measures).
    *   Log all account lockout events.
    *   Consider notifying users via email when their account is locked.

3.  **Strong Password Policies (High Priority):**
    *   Enforce strong password requirements:
        *   Minimum length (e.g., 12 characters).
        *   Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
        *   Reject common passwords (using a blacklist or a password strength meter).
    *   Encourage (or require) users to change their passwords regularly.

4.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (High Priority):**
    *   Implement support for 2FA (e.g., using TOTP, WebAuthn).  This is the single most effective defense against brute-force attacks.
    *   Make 2FA easy to enable and use.
    *   Consider making 2FA mandatory for administrator accounts.

5.  **CAPTCHA (Medium Priority):**
    *   Implement a CAPTCHA or similar challenge on the login form to deter automated attacks.
    *   Use a modern CAPTCHA service (e.g., reCAPTCHA v3) that is less intrusive to users.

6.  **Secure Session Management (Medium Priority):**
    *   Ensure session tokens are long, random, and unpredictable.
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication to protect session tokens from interception.
    *   Set appropriate session timeout values.
    *   Implement session invalidation on logout.

7.  **Information Leakage Prevention (Medium Priority):**
    *   Use generic error messages for login failures (e.g., "Invalid username or password").
    *   Avoid revealing any internal server details in error messages.

8.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (Medium Priority):**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the Wallabag codebase and configuration.
    *   Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

9.  **Dependency Management (Medium Priority):**
    *   Keep all dependencies up to date.
    *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `composer audit`, `symfony security:check`) to identify known vulnerabilities.

10. **Password Reset Security (Medium Priority):**
    * Implement secure password reset functionality, including email verification and potentially additional security questions or 2FA.
    * Limit the number of password reset attempts.

### 4.6 Testing Recommendations
1.  **Automated Brute-Force Testing:** Use tools like Hydra or Burp Suite Intruder to simulate brute-force attacks against a test instance of Wallabag.  This will help verify the effectiveness of rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
2.  **Manual Testing:**  Attempt to manually guess passwords and trigger account lockouts.
3.  **Code Review:**  Regularly review the authentication-related code for potential vulnerabilities.
4.  **Penetration Testing:**  Engage a security professional to conduct penetration testing, including attempts to bypass authentication.
5.  **Unit and Integration Tests:**  Write unit and integration tests to verify the correct behavior of authentication logic, including rate limiting and account lockout.
6. **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing techniques on authentication endpoints to identify unexpected behavior.

## 5. Conclusion

Brute-force and dictionary attacks are a significant threat to any web application that uses password-based authentication.  By implementing the mitigations outlined above, the Wallabag development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks and protect user accounts and data.  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and a proactive approach to security are essential to maintain a strong security posture. The most crucial steps are implementing robust rate limiting, account lockouts, strong password policies, and, most importantly, two-factor authentication.
