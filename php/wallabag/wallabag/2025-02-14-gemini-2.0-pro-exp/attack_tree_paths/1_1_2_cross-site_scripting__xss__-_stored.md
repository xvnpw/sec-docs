Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on Stored XSS in Wallabag, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis of Stored XSS in Wallabag

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the Wallabag application, specifically focusing on how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise user accounts or data.  We aim to identify the specific code paths and data flows that could lead to a successful Stored XSS attack, and to evaluate the effectiveness of existing and potential mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the security posture of Wallabag against this threat.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the **Stored XSS** attack vector (attack tree path 1.1.2).  This means we are concerned with scenarios where malicious script code is:

*   **Injected:**  Persistently stored within Wallabag's data storage (database).  This typically occurs when a user saves an article containing the malicious payload.
*   **Executed:**  Later retrieved and rendered in the browser of another (or the same) user, without proper sanitization or escaping.

We will consider the following aspects within this scope:

*   **Data Input Points:**  Identify all locations where user-supplied data related to article content can be saved to the database. This includes the primary article saving functionality, but also potentially less obvious areas like annotations, tags, or import features.
*   **Data Storage and Retrieval:**  Examine how article content is stored in the database and how it is retrieved and prepared for rendering in the user's browser.  This includes understanding the database schema and the relevant code responsible for fetching and processing this data.
*   **Rendering Context:**  Analyze how the retrieved article content is integrated into the HTML page.  This involves understanding the templating engine used (likely Twig, given Wallabag's Symfony foundation) and how data is passed to the templates.
*   **Existing Mitigations:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of Wallabag's current defenses against Stored XSS, including HTML sanitization libraries, Content Security Policy (CSP) configurations, and cookie security flags.
*   **Bypass Techniques:**  Explore potential methods an attacker might use to bypass existing security measures, considering known bypasses for common sanitization libraries and weaknesses in CSP configurations.

We will *not* be covering Reflected or DOM-based XSS in this analysis, nor will we delve into other attack vectors like SQL injection or CSRF, except where they might indirectly relate to the Stored XSS vulnerability.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the Wallabag codebase (available on GitHub) to identify vulnerable code patterns and data flows.  This will involve using tools like `grep`, IDE code navigation, and potentially static analysis tools.  We will focus on PHP code (backend) and JavaScript code (frontend) that handles article content.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Black-box Testing):**  Attempting to inject and trigger XSS payloads in a local instance of Wallabag.  This will involve using a web browser and potentially tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to intercept and modify HTTP requests.  This helps confirm vulnerabilities identified during code review and discover any unforeseen issues.
*   **Security Research:**  Reviewing existing security advisories, blog posts, and research papers related to XSS vulnerabilities, HTML sanitization bypasses, and CSP weaknesses.  This will help us understand common attack patterns and potential bypass techniques.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Thinking like an attacker to identify potential attack scenarios and exploit paths.  This involves considering the attacker's motivations, capabilities, and potential targets.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Examining Wallabag's official documentation, including developer guides and security guidelines, to understand the intended security mechanisms and best practices.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2 Stored XSS

### 2.1 Data Input Points

The primary input point for Stored XSS in Wallabag is the article saving functionality.  This involves several potential sub-paths:

*   **Direct URL Saving:**  The user provides a URL, and Wallabag fetches the content.  This is the most common and likely the most vulnerable path.
*   **Manual Content Entry:**  Wallabag might allow users to directly paste or type in HTML content.  This is a high-risk area if not properly sanitized.
*   **Import Functionality:**  If Wallabag supports importing articles from other services (e.g., Pocket, Instapaper) or file formats (e.g., HTML, Markdown), these import processes could be vulnerable.
*   **Annotations/Highlights:**  If users can add annotations or highlights to articles, and these are stored as HTML, this could be another injection point.
* **Tags:** Although less likely to contain full HTML, tags could still be a vector if not properly escaped.

### 2.2 Data Storage and Retrieval

*   **Database Schema:**  We need to examine the database schema (likely MySQL or PostgreSQL) to understand how article content is stored.  Key questions:
    *   What data type is used for the article content (e.g., TEXT, LONGTEXT)?
    *   Is there any pre-processing or encoding done before storage?
    *   Are annotations, highlights, and tags stored separately or within the main article content?
*   **Data Retrieval:**  We need to identify the PHP code responsible for fetching article content from the database.  This likely involves:
    *   ORM usage (likely Doctrine, given Symfony).  We need to examine the entity classes and repository methods used to retrieve article data.
    *   SQL queries (if any direct queries are used).  We need to check for any unsafe concatenation of user-supplied data into SQL queries (though this is more relevant to SQL injection, it's good practice to check).
*   **Pre-Rendering Processing:**  Before the content is passed to the templating engine, is there any further processing?  This is a crucial point for sanitization.

### 2.3 Rendering Context

*   **Templating Engine (Twig):**  Wallabag likely uses Twig for templating.  We need to examine the Twig templates used to render article content.  Key questions:
    *   How is the article content variable passed to the template?
    *   Is the `|raw` filter used?  This filter disables auto-escaping and is a major red flag.  It should *never* be used with untrusted data.
    *   Is the `|escape` filter (or its shorthand `|e`) used consistently?  This is the default behavior in Twig, but it can be overridden.
    *   Are there any custom Twig filters or functions that might affect rendering?
*   **JavaScript Interaction:**  After the HTML is rendered, is there any JavaScript code that interacts with the article content?  This could introduce DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities, but it could also interact with a Stored XSS payload.

### 2.4 Existing Mitigations and Their Effectiveness

*   **HTML Sanitization (Likely `html-purifier`):**  Wallabag almost certainly uses an HTML sanitization library, likely `html-purifier`.  We need to:
    *   **Confirm the Library:**  Identify the exact library and version used.
    *   **Configuration:**  Examine the configuration of the sanitizer.  Is it using a whitelist-based approach?  What tags and attributes are allowed?  Are there any custom rules?  A misconfigured sanitizer can be easily bypassed.
    *   **Placement:**  Verify that the sanitizer is applied *before* the content is stored in the database, *not* after retrieval.  Sanitizing after retrieval is too late, as the malicious script could have already been executed.
    *   **Known Bypasses:**  Research known bypasses for the specific version and configuration of the sanitizer.  Attackers often find ways to craft payloads that evade sanitization rules.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Wallabag should have a CSP in place.  We need to:
    *   **Examine the CSP Headers:**  Use browser developer tools to inspect the `Content-Security-Policy` headers sent by Wallabag.
    *   **Effectiveness Against XSS:**  Analyze the CSP directives to see how effective they are against XSS.  A strong CSP should:
        *   Disallow inline scripts (`script-src 'self'`).
        *   Restrict the sources of external scripts.
        *   Potentially use `nonce` or `hash` values to allow specific, trusted scripts.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Look for common CSP weaknesses, such as:
        *   `unsafe-inline` (allows inline scripts, defeating the purpose).
        *   `unsafe-eval` (allows `eval()`, which can be used to execute arbitrary code).
        *   Wildcards (`*`) in source lists (too permissive).
        *   Missing directives (e.g., no `object-src` directive, leaving a potential vector through plugins).
*   **Cookie Security Flags:**
    *   **HttpOnly:**  The `HttpOnly` flag should be set on all session cookies.  This prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating the risk of session hijacking via XSS.
    *   **Secure:**  The `Secure` flag should be set on all cookies.  This ensures that cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS, preventing interception by man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **SameSite:** The `SameSite` attribute should be set to `Strict` or `Lax`. This helps prevent CSRF attacks, and can also provide some protection against XSS by limiting the contexts in which cookies are sent.

### 2.5 Potential Bypass Techniques

*   **HTML Sanitizer Bypasses:**  Attackers constantly find new ways to bypass HTML sanitizers.  We need to research:
    *   **Mutation XSS (mXSS):**  Exploits differences in how browsers parse and mutate HTML, leading to inconsistencies between the sanitizer and the browser's rendering engine.
    *   **Tag/Attribute Obfuscation:**  Using unusual or unexpected encodings, character variations, or case manipulations to bypass whitelists.
    *   **Logic Flaws:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the sanitizer's parsing logic or rule implementation.
*   **CSP Bypasses:**
    *   **JSONP Callbacks:**  If the CSP allows external scripts from certain domains, and those domains offer JSONP endpoints, an attacker might be able to use a JSONP callback to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **AngularJS Sandbox Escapes:**  If AngularJS is used (even in a limited way), and the CSP is not carefully configured, there might be sandbox escape vulnerabilities.
    *   **Other Framework-Specific Bypasses:**  Similar to AngularJS, other JavaScript frameworks might have specific bypass techniques.
    *   **Policy Injection:**  If the attacker can control any part of the CSP header itself (e.g., through a header injection vulnerability), they can weaken or disable the policy.
*   **Combining Techniques:**  Attackers might combine multiple techniques to achieve a successful XSS attack.  For example, they might use a sanitizer bypass to inject a small piece of code that then bypasses the CSP.

### 2.6 Example Exploit Scenario (Hypothetical)

Let's assume Wallabag uses `html-purifier` with a default configuration, and the CSP allows scripts from `self` and `cdn.example.com`.

1.  **Attacker Discovers Bypass:** The attacker researches `html-purifier` bypasses and finds a technique that uses a mutated SVG tag to inject a script.  For example: `<svg><animatetransform onbegin="alert(1)"></svg>`.
2.  **Attacker Saves Article:** The attacker saves an article containing the malicious SVG payload.  The `html-purifier` sanitizer, due to the bypass, fails to remove the `onbegin` attribute.
3.  **Victim Views Article:**  A victim user views the article.  The browser parses the SVG tag and executes the `alert(1)` JavaScript code.
4.  **Escalation:**  The attacker replaces `alert(1)` with more malicious code, such as:
    *   Stealing the victim's session cookie and sending it to the attacker's server.
    *   Redirecting the victim to a phishing page.
    *   Modifying the content of the page to display false information.
    *   Loading an external script from `cdn.example.com` (allowed by the CSP) that contains further exploit code.  The attacker would need to control or compromise `cdn.example.com` or find a vulnerable JSONP endpoint on that domain.

### 2.7 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

1.  **Update HTML Sanitizer:** Ensure the latest version of `html-purifier` (or the chosen sanitizer) is used, and regularly update it to address newly discovered bypasses.
2.  **Strengthen Sanitizer Configuration:** Review and tighten the `html-purifier` configuration.  Use a strict whitelist-based approach, allowing only the minimum necessary tags and attributes.  Consider custom rules to block specific attack patterns.
3.  **Harden CSP:**
    *   Remove `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` if present.
    *   Use `nonce` or `hash` values for trusted inline scripts instead of `unsafe-inline`.
    *   Restrict external script sources to a minimum.  Avoid wildcards.
    *   Include all relevant directives (e.g., `object-src`, `frame-src`, `img-src`).
    *   Regularly review and test the CSP.
4.  **Verify Cookie Security:** Ensure `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes are set correctly on all cookies.
5.  **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all user-supplied data, including URLs, manual content, import data, annotations, and tags.  This should be done *before* sanitization.
6.  **Output Encoding:** Ensure that all user-supplied data is properly encoded (escaped) when rendered in HTML, even after sanitization.  Use the appropriate Twig filters (`|e` or `|escape`) consistently.  Avoid `|raw`.
7.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits, including code reviews and penetration testing, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
8.  **Security Training:** Provide security training to developers on secure coding practices, including XSS prevention techniques.
9.  **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to potential XSS attacks.
10. **Consider using a more modern sanitization approach:** Explore alternatives to `html-purifier`, such as DOMPurify (JavaScript-based, can be used on the client-side before sending data to the server), which might offer better protection against mXSS.
11. **Sanitize on Input, Encode on Output:** This is a crucial principle. Sanitize data *before* storing it in the database, and encode it *again* when displaying it. This provides defense-in-depth.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the Stored XSS threat to Wallabag and offers actionable recommendations to mitigate the risk. By implementing these recommendations, the Wallabag development team can significantly enhance the application's security posture and protect users from this common and dangerous vulnerability.
