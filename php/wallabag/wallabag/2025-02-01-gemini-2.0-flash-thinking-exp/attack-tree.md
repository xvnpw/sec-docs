```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Wallabag Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_wallabag_application__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or access to the Wallabag application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Wallabag Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_wallabag_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the primary attack vector, focusing on exploiting weaknesses in Wallabag's code, design, or dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Web Application Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__web_application_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This category encompasses common web application security flaws that might be present in Wallabag.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__cross-site_scripting__xss___critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Stored XSS in Article Content [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into article content (title, body, tags, annotations) that is stored in the database.
        *   When other users view the article, the malicious script executes in their browsers.
        *   This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__cross-site_request_forgery__csrf___high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Attacker crafts a malicious web page or link that, when visited by an authenticated Wallabag user, triggers unintended actions on the Wallabag application.
    *   These actions could include adding a new administrator account, changing user settings, modifying articles, or performing other administrative functions.
    *   Success depends on the user being logged into Wallabag and clicking the malicious link or visiting the malicious page.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attacker injects malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are used in database queries.
        *   If Wallabag's database queries are not properly parameterized or sanitized, the injected SQL code can be executed by the database server.
        *   This can lead to data breaches (extraction of sensitive data), data manipulation (modification or deletion of data), and potentially even code execution on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Authentication/Authorization Flaws [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7__authenticationauthorization_flaws__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Weak Password Policy [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Wallabag might not enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
        *   Users might choose weak or default passwords.
        *   Attackers can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess user credentials and gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Wallabag might use predictable or sequential IDs to access resources (e.g., articles, user profiles).
        *   Attackers can manipulate these IDs in URLs or API requests to access resources belonging to other users without proper authorization.
        *   This can lead to unauthorized viewing or modification of articles, user settings, and other sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Parsing/Fetching Vulnerabilities (Specific to Wallabag's Core Functionality) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/8__parsingfetching_vulnerabilities__specific_to_wallabag's_core_functionality___critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Malicious Article Injection [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attackers craft articles with malicious content designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Wallabag's article parsing and content extraction logic.
        *   This could involve:
            *   Triggering vulnerabilities in underlying parsing libraries used by Wallabag (e.g., HTML parsers).
            *   Bypassing security filters designed to sanitize article content.
            *   Crafting specific HTML or other content formats that lead to XSS, SSRF, or other vulnerabilities when processed by Wallabag.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Exploit Wallabag Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/9__exploit_wallabag_misconfiguration__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Wallabag might be deployed with insecure default settings that are not changed by administrators.
        *   **Default credentials not changed [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   The most critical misconfiguration. If default administrator or user credentials are not changed after installation, attackers can easily gain full administrative access.
    *   **Exposed Configuration Files [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Configuration files (e.g., `parameters.yml`) containing sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secret keys might be publicly accessible due to server misconfiguration.
        *   This leads to direct information disclosure and potential full compromise of the application.
    *   **Outdated Wallabag Version [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Running an outdated version of Wallabag that contains known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
        *   Attackers can easily find and exploit these vulnerabilities using readily available exploit code or tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Vulnerable Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/10__vulnerable_dependencies__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Wallabag relies on various third-party libraries and components.
    *   If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities (especially in outdated versions), attackers can exploit them to compromise Wallabag.
    *   This can lead to Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, or Denial of Service, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
