# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict URL Validation for Article URLs](./mitigation_strategies/strict_url_validation_for_article_urls.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify URL Input Points in Wallabag:** Locate all areas within Wallabag's codebase where users can input URLs for article retrieval (e.g., bookmarklet, web interface form for adding articles, API endpoints for article submission).
    2.  **Implement URL Scheme Whitelist in Wallabag Code:**  Within Wallabag's backend code, enforce validation to accept only `http://` and `https://` URL schemes. Reject any other schemes before processing the URL further.
    3.  **Utilize URL Parsing Library within Wallabag:** Integrate a URL parsing library (available in PHP, Wallabag's primary language) within Wallabag's codebase to parse and normalize URLs. This ensures consistent URL handling and helps prevent bypasses.
    4.  **Canonicalization within Wallabag:** Use the URL parsing library within Wallabag to canonicalize URLs. This step should be performed by Wallabag itself to standardize URL format before fetching content.
    5.  **Optional Domain/IP Denylist/Safelist within Wallabag:**  Consider implementing a domain/IP denylist or safelist directly within Wallabag's configuration or code if stricter control over fetched content sources is required. This would be a Wallabag-specific configuration.
    6.  **Wallabag Error Handling:** Ensure Wallabag provides user-friendly error messages when an invalid URL is submitted, guiding them to use correct URL formats.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from using Wallabag to make requests to internal network resources or unintended external services by restricting URL schemes Wallabag processes.
    *   **Open Redirect (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers crafting URLs that, when processed by Wallabag and presented to users, redirect them to malicious external sites.
    *   **Bypass of Access Controls (Medium Severity):** Prevents potential bypasses of access controls that might arise from flawed URL parsing within Wallabag itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SSRF:** Significantly Reduced. Strict URL validation within Wallabag is a direct defense against SSRF attacks originating from URL input.
    *   **Open Redirect:** Partially Reduced. Wallabag's URL handling becomes more secure, but output encoding is also needed for full mitigation.
    *   **Bypass of Access Controls:** Partially Reduced. Wallabag's internal URL processing becomes more robust, but authorization logic is also essential.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely partially implemented in Wallabag. Basic URL validation for format is common. However, the strictness of scheme whitelisting and canonicalization within Wallabag's code needs verification.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Scheme Whitelist Enforcement in Wallabag Code:** Verify and enforce strict whitelisting of `http` and `https` schemes directly within Wallabag's URL processing logic.
    *   **Consistent Canonicalization in Wallabag:** Ensure URL canonicalization is consistently applied by Wallabag itself throughout its URL handling processes.
    *   **Wallabag Domain/IP List (Optional):**  Consider adding a Wallabag-specific configuration option for domain/IP denylists or safelists.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Sanitization and Output Encoding in Wallabag](./mitigation_strategies/content_sanitization_and_output_encoding_in_wallabag.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Robust HTML Sanitization Library for Wallabag (PHP):** Select a well-maintained and security-focused HTML sanitization library compatible with PHP, Wallabag's language (e.g., HTMLPurifier).
    2.  **Sanitize HTML Content within Wallabag on Server-Side:**  Integrate the chosen HTML sanitization library into Wallabag's backend code. Apply sanitization to fetched article content *within Wallabag* before storing it in Wallabag's database.
    3.  **Configure Sanitization Library for Wallabag Security:** Configure the sanitization library within Wallabag to remove potentially harmful HTML elements and attributes according to security best practices, specifically for the context of article content.
    4.  **Output Encoding in Wallabag for Display:** When Wallabag displays article content, ensure proper output encoding is applied *by Wallabag* based on the output context (HTML entity encoding for HTML output).
    5.  **Context-Aware Encoding in Wallabag:** If Wallabag dynamically generates JavaScript that includes article content, use JavaScript-specific encoding functions *within Wallabag* to prevent XSS in JavaScript contexts.
    6.  **Regularly Update Sanitization Library used by Wallabag:**  Establish a process to regularly update the HTML sanitization library used by Wallabag to benefit from security updates and bug fixes within the library.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  Significantly reduces stored XSS vulnerabilities in Wallabag by sanitizing article content before storage and ensuring safe output during display within Wallabag.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly Reduced. Effective HTML sanitization within Wallabag is a primary defense against XSS from fetched articles.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely implemented to some degree in Wallabag. Wallabag needs to render articles safely, suggesting some HTML sanitization is present. However, the robustness and configuration of sanitization *within Wallabag* need verification.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Server-Side Sanitization Verification in Wallabag:** Confirm that HTML sanitization is consistently performed by Wallabag on the server-side before storing article data.
    *   **Sanitization Library Review and Hardening in Wallabag:** Review the specific sanitization library used by Wallabag and its configuration to ensure it's robust and configured for strict security.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding Audit in Wallabag:** Audit Wallabag's codebase to ensure context-aware output encoding is consistently applied wherever article content is displayed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation for Wallabag](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__implementation_for_wallabag.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Strict CSP Policy for Wallabag:**  Define a restrictive CSP policy specifically tailored for Wallabag's needs. Start with a strict policy and refine it based on Wallabag's required resources.
    2.  **Identify Necessary External Resources for Wallabag:** Analyze Wallabag's dependencies and features to identify legitimate external resources it needs to load (e.g., CDNs for fonts used by Wallabag, if any).
    3.  **Add Exceptions in Wallabag's CSP for Trusted Origins:**  For each necessary external resource, add specific exceptions to Wallabag's CSP policy, allowing loading only from trusted origins.
    4.  **Use Nonces or Hashes for Inline Scripts/Styles in Wallabag (Recommended):** If Wallabag uses inline scripts or styles, configure Wallabag to use nonces or hashes in its CSP to allowlist these specific inline code blocks instead of using `'unsafe-inline'`.
    5.  **Configure CSP Header in Wallabag's Web Server Configuration:** Configure the web server serving Wallabag to send the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with the defined CSP policy for all Wallabag responses. This is a configuration step specific to the Wallabag deployment environment.
    6.  **Testing and Monitoring Wallabag's CSP:** Thoroughly test Wallabag's CSP implementation to ensure it doesn't break Wallabag's functionality. Monitor CSP violation reports (if configured) to identify issues specific to Wallabag.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  Provides a secondary defense layer against XSS in Wallabag, even if sanitization within Wallabag fails. CSP can prevent execution of injected scripts within the Wallabag application.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):**  `frame-ancestors 'self'` directive in Wallabag's CSP mitigates clickjacking attacks against the Wallabag interface.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Directives like `form-action 'self'` and `base-uri 'self'` in Wallabag's CSP can help mitigate certain data injection attacks targeting Wallabag forms and base URLs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly Reduced for Wallabag users. CSP acts as a crucial defense-in-depth measure for Wallabag against XSS.
    *   **Clickjacking:** Significantly Reduced for Wallabag interface.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks:** Partially Reduced for Wallabag forms and base URLs.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially partially implemented for Wallabag. CSP implementation depends on the deployment environment and configuration. Wallabag itself might not enforce a strict CSP by default.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Strict and Comprehensive CSP Policy for Wallabag:** Define and implement a strict CSP policy specifically for Wallabag.
    *   **Nonce/Hash for Inline Scripts/Styles in Wallabag:**  Refactor Wallabag's code to use nonces or hashes for inline scripts and styles if `'unsafe-inline'` is currently used or needed.
    *   **CSP Reporting Configuration for Wallabag:** Configure CSP reporting in the web server for Wallabag to monitor policy violations and identify potential issues specific to Wallabag usage.
