### 4. Deep Analysis: Default Credentials Not Changed

#### 4.1. Description of Attack Vector

The "Default credentials not changed" attack vector exploits the common oversight of administrators failing to modify the pre-configured default usernames and passwords after installing Wallabag. Many web applications, including content management systems and self-hosted applications like Wallabag, often come with default administrative or user accounts for initial setup and access.

If these default credentials are not changed during or immediately after the installation process, they become a significant security vulnerability. Attackers can easily discover these default credentials through:

*   **Public Documentation:** Default credentials are often documented in the application's official installation guides or online documentation.
*   **Online Forums and Communities:** Information about default credentials might be shared in online forums, security communities, or blog posts.
*   **Pre-computation and Brute-force Attempts:** Attackers maintain lists of common default credentials for various applications and can attempt to brute-force login pages using these lists.

#### 4.2. Technical Details of the Attack

1.  **Discovery of Login Page:** Attackers first identify the login page of the Wallabag instance. This is typically located at a predictable URL path relative to the base URL of the Wallabag installation (e.g., `/login`, `/app/login`, `/admin`).

2.  **Credential Guessing/Brute-forcing:** Attackers attempt to log in using known default usernames and passwords. Common default credentials often include combinations like:
    *   `admin` / `admin`
    *   `administrator` / `password`
    *   `wallabag` / `wallabag`
    *   `root` / `password`
    *   `user` / `password`

    Attackers may use automated tools or scripts to rapidly try multiple combinations.

3.  **Successful Login:** If the default credentials have not been changed, the attacker will successfully authenticate as an administrator or a privileged user.

4.  **Post-Exploitation Activities:** Upon successful login with default credentials, the attacker gains access to the Wallabag administrative interface. This access allows them to perform a wide range of malicious activities, including:

    *   **Full Administrative Control:**  Gain complete control over the Wallabag instance, including user management, configuration settings, and application features.
    *   **Data Access and Exfiltration:** Access and potentially exfiltrate all stored articles, user data, configuration files, and potentially database credentials if accessible through the application interface.
    *   **Data Manipulation and Deletion:** Modify or delete articles, user accounts, and application settings, leading to data integrity issues and potential service disruption.
    *   **Malware Injection:** Inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript, PHP) into the application, potentially affecting all users who access the Wallabag instance. This could lead to drive-by downloads, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or further compromise of user systems.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Create new administrative accounts or modify existing ones to maintain persistent access even after the default credentials are changed.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Intentionally misconfigure or overload the application to cause a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Use the compromised Wallabag instance as a pivot point to attack other systems within the same network, especially if the Wallabag server is connected to internal networks.

#### 4.3. Potential Impact and Consequences

The impact of successful exploitation of unchanged default credentials in Wallabag is **CRITICAL**. It can lead to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server and network. The consequences include:

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive data, including user information, stored articles, and potentially configuration details (including database credentials if exposed through the application), can be accessed and exfiltrated by attackers.
*   **Integrity Breach:** Data within Wallabag can be modified, deleted, or corrupted by attackers, leading to loss of trust and reliability in the application.
*   **Availability Disruption:** Attackers can disrupt the service by modifying configurations, deleting data, or launching denial-of-service attacks, making Wallabag unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Reputational Damage:** If Wallabag is used in a professional or organizational context, a security breach due to default credentials can severely damage the reputation of the organization or individual responsible for its deployment.
*   **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the type of data stored in Wallabag and applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), a data breach resulting from default credentials could lead to legal and compliance penalties.

#### 4.4. Likelihood of Success

The likelihood of successful exploitation of this attack vector is considered **HIGH**. This is due to several factors:

*   **Common Oversight:**  Administrators, especially those with limited security expertise or under time pressure, often overlook the crucial step of changing default credentials during or after installation.
*   **Publicly Known Default Credentials:** Default credentials for many applications are widely known and easily accessible through online resources.
*   **Automated Scanning and Exploitation:** Attackers frequently use automated tools to scan for vulnerable applications with default credentials, making this a low-effort, high-reward attack vector.
*   **Ease of Exploitation:** Exploiting default credentials requires minimal technical skill. It is often as simple as entering the default username and password into the login form.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

To effectively mitigate the risk of "Default credentials not changed" in Wallabag, the following strategies are recommended:

**Preventative Measures (Most Effective):**

*   **Mandatory Password Change During Installation:** The Wallabag installation process should **force** or strongly encourage the administrator to change the default administrative credentials during the initial setup. This could be implemented by:
    *   Presenting a clear warning message about default credentials during installation.
    *   Requiring the administrator to set a new administrative password before completing the installation.
    *   Disabling default accounts after initial setup and forcing the creation of a new administrative account with a strong password.
*   **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:** Implement and enforce strong password policies for all user accounts, especially administrative accounts. This includes:
    *   Minimum password length.
    *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    *   Password expiration and rotation policies.
*   **Security Hardening Documentation:** Provide clear and prominent documentation on security hardening best practices, explicitly emphasizing the importance of changing default credentials immediately after installation. This documentation should be easily accessible and highlighted during the installation process.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Checks:** Implement regular security audits and checks to identify and remediate any instances of default credentials still being in use. This can be done through manual reviews or automated security scanning tools.

**Detective Measures:**

*   **Login Attempt Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting for failed login attempts, especially for default usernames.  Unusual patterns of failed login attempts targeting default usernames could indicate an active attack.
*   **Account Activity Logging:**  Maintain detailed logs of all account activity, including logins, configuration changes, and data access. This can help in detecting and investigating suspicious activity related to compromised accounts.

**Corrective Measures:**

*   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan to address security breaches, including scenarios involving compromised default credentials. This plan should outline steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
*   **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to temporarily disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. This can help to slow down brute-force attacks targeting default credentials.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** While not directly preventing the use of default credentials, implementing 2FA for administrative accounts adds an extra layer of security. Even if default credentials are compromised, attackers would still need to bypass the second factor of authentication.

#### 4.6. Conclusion

The "Default credentials not changed" attack path represents a **critical security vulnerability** in Wallabag deployments. Its high likelihood of success and severe potential impact necessitate immediate and proactive mitigation.

**Recommendations for Development Team:**

*   **Prioritize mandatory password change during installation as a high-priority feature.**
*   **Enhance security documentation and make it more prominent during the installation process.**
*   **Consider incorporating automated security checks or warnings within the application itself to remind administrators about default credentials.**

**Recommendations for Deployment Team/Administrators:**

*   **Immediately change all default credentials after installing Wallabag.**
*   **Implement strong password policies and enforce them for all users.**
*   **Regularly review user accounts and configurations to ensure no default credentials are in use.**
*   **Implement security monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious login activity.**
*   **Educate users and administrators about the importance of security best practices, including password management.**

By addressing this critical vulnerability, the security posture of Wallabag can be significantly improved, protecting users and their data from potential compromise.
