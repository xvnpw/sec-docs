# Attack Surface Analysis for wallabag/wallabag

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Article URL Parsing](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_article_url_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate Wallabag into making requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or external malicious servers, by crafting a malicious article URL.
*   **Wallabag Contribution:** Wallabag's core functionality involves fetching and parsing content from URLs provided by users. This process, if not properly secured, can be exploited for SSRF.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL like `http://localhost:6379` when adding a new article. Wallabag, attempting to fetch content, sends a request to the local Redis server, potentially exposing internal services or data.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal services, data exfiltration from internal networks, port scanning of internal infrastructure, potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict URL validation and sanitization to prevent requests to internal or restricted IP ranges and ports.
        *   Use a robust and actively maintained URL parsing library.
        *   Consider using a proxy or intermediary service to fetch external content, limiting Wallabag's direct network access.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed URL schemes and domains if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Provided Content (Tags, Notes, Titles)](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-provided_content__tags__notes__titles_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code injected by an attacker through user-provided fields (tags, notes, article titles) is stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected content.
*   **Wallabag Contribution:** Wallabag allows users to add tags, notes, and modify article titles. Insufficient sanitization of these inputs before storage and display can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker adds a tag like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` to an article. When another user views this article, the JavaScript code is executed in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting them to malicious websites.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided content.
        *   Use a templating engine with automatic output escaping by default.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS impact.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Search Functionality](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_search_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into search queries if user-provided search terms are not properly sanitized before being used in database queries.
*   **Wallabag Contribution:** Wallabag's search functionality, if implemented using raw SQL queries without proper parameterization, is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Example:** An attacker enters a search term like `' OR '1'='1` into the search bar. If unsanitized, this could bypass query logic and potentially expose or modify database data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, potential for complete database server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements** for database interactions.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for search terms.
        *   Utilize an ORM that handles query construction and parameterization securely.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in API authentication or authorization can allow attackers to bypass security controls and access or manipulate API endpoints without proper permissions.
*   **Wallabag Contribution:** Wallabag exposes API endpoints. Insufficiently secured APIs can be exploited for unauthorized access and manipulation.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint for deleting articles lacks proper authorization checks. An attacker without admin privileges could delete articles via crafted API requests.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data manipulation, unauthorized access to functionalities, privilege escalation, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for API access (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys with rotation).
        *   Enforce strict authorization checks at each API endpoint based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for API access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Upload (If Enabled/Present)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_upload__if_enabledpresent_.md)

*   **Description:** If Wallabag allows file uploads without proper restrictions, attackers can upload malicious files to the server.
*   **Wallabag Contribution:** Depending on Wallabag's features (plugins, themes), file upload functionality might exist. Insecure file upload is a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP webshell disguised as an image. If Wallabag doesn't validate file types and stores it in a public directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), server compromise, malware distribution, defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Avoid file upload functionality if possible.**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on content (magic numbers), not just extensions.
        *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web root in a non-executable directory.
        *   Implement file size limits.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Default configurations that are not hardened can leave Wallabag vulnerable to attacks.
*   **Wallabag Contribution:** Insecure default settings in Wallabag can create immediate vulnerabilities upon deployment.
*   **Example:** Default administrative credentials are not changed after installation. Attackers can use these default credentials to gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, account compromise, data breach, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Ensure default configurations are secure by design.
        *   Force or strongly encourage users to change default credentials during installation.
        *   Provide clear documentation on hardening Wallabag's configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Wallabag relies on third-party libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise Wallabag.
*   **Wallabag Contribution:** Wallabag's use of third-party libraries means vulnerabilities in those libraries directly impact Wallabag's security.
*   **Example:** A JavaScript library used by Wallabag has a known XSS vulnerability. If Wallabag uses a vulnerable version, attackers can exploit this.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, including XSS, RCE, Denial of Service, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   Keep dependencies updated to the latest stable versions with security patches.
        *   Use a dependency management system for updates and vulnerability tracking.
