## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Parsedown library (focus on high-risk areas).

**Sub-Tree (High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes):**

* Compromise Application via Parsedown Exploitation
    * **Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)** **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * **Inject <script> tags** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **Inject HTML event handlers** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **Inject malicious <svg> tags** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * **Cause Denial of Service (DoS)** **[HIGH-RISK PATH if availability is critical]**
        * **Resource Exhaustion** **[CRITICAL NODE for DoS]**
            * Provide extremely large Markdown input
            * Provide deeply nested Markdown structures

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

This high-risk path focuses on exploiting Parsedown's conversion of Markdown to HTML to inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of other users' browsers.

* **Critical Node: Inject `<script>` tags:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts Markdown input that, when processed by Parsedown, results in the generation of `<script>` tags within the HTML output.
    * **Mechanism:** This often exploits insufficient sanitization of inline code blocks or other areas where raw HTML might be inadvertently passed through.
    * **Example:**  An attacker might input Markdown like ```<script>stealCookies()</script>```. If Parsedown doesn't properly escape the HTML within the code block, it will be rendered as an executable script tag in the final HTML.

* **Critical Node: Inject HTML event handlers:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages HTML attributes that can execute JavaScript code, such as `onerror`, `onload`, `onmouseover`, etc., within Markdown constructs.
    * **Mechanism:** This typically involves exploiting insufficient sanitization of attributes within image or link Markdown syntax.
    * **Example:** An attacker might input Markdown like `![alt text](invalid_url onerror="sendDataToServer()")` or `[link text](javascript:void(maliciousFunction()))`. If Parsedown doesn't sanitize these attributes, the `onerror` or `javascript:` URL will execute malicious code.

* **Critical Node: Inject malicious `<svg>` tags:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects `<svg>` (Scalable Vector Graphics) tags into the Markdown input. SVG elements can contain embedded JavaScript within tags like `<script>` or event handlers.
    * **Mechanism:** This relies on Parsedown not properly sanitizing SVG elements and their attributes.
    * **Example:** An attacker might input Markdown containing `<svg><script>stealTokens()</script></svg>` or `<svg onload="evilCode()"></svg>`. If Parsedown doesn't sanitize these SVG elements, the embedded JavaScript will execute.

**2. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH if availability is critical]:**

This high-risk path focuses on making the application unavailable by overwhelming its resources through specially crafted Markdown input.

* **Critical Node: Resource Exhaustion:**
    * **Attack Vector: Provide extremely large Markdown input:**
        * **Mechanism:** An attacker sends a very large amount of Markdown text to the application. Parsing this large input consumes significant server resources (CPU, memory), potentially leading to slowdowns or crashes.
        * **Example:** Sending gigabytes of repetitive Markdown text.
    * **Attack Vector: Provide deeply nested Markdown structures:**
        * **Mechanism:** An attacker crafts Markdown with deeply nested elements, such as lists or blockquotes. Parsing these deeply nested structures can be computationally expensive and lead to excessive memory consumption or stack overflow errors.
        * **Example:** Creating a list with hundreds of levels of indentation or deeply nested blockquotes.
