# Attack Surface Analysis for ramsey/uuid

## Attack Surface: [Predictable Version 1 UUID Generation](./attack_surfaces/predictable_version_1_uuid_generation.md)

* **Description:** Version 1 UUIDs incorporate the host's MAC address and a timestamp. If the MAC address is known or can be inferred, and the timestamp resolution is low, future UUIDs generated on the same host can be predicted.
    * **How UUID Contributes:** The inherent structure of Version 1 UUIDs, embedding potentially identifiable information, creates this attack surface.
    * **Example:** A password reset token is generated using a Version 1 UUID. An attacker who knows the server's MAC address and observes a previous token can predict future tokens and potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access, account takeover, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Version 4 UUIDs:**  Version 4 UUIDs are randomly generated and do not contain predictable information like MAC addresses or timestamps.
        * **Rotate Sensitive UUIDs Frequently:** For security-sensitive applications, rotate UUIDs used for authentication or authorization regularly.
        * **Implement Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests that rely on UUID generation to make prediction attempts more difficult.
