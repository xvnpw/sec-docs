## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit UUID Weaknesses to Compromise Application Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_uuid_weaknesses_to_compromise_application_functionality.md)

This is the root goal, and any successful exploitation of UUID weaknesses falls under this path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Predictable UUID Generation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_predictable_uuid_generation.md)

This path encompasses all methods of generating predictable UUIDs, which can be exploited for various malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Version 1 Predictability (Time-Based)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_version_1_predictability__time-based_.md)

**Predict Timestamp Component:** Attackers attempt to predict the timestamp embedded in the UUID.
    * Predictable Clock Sequence: Guessing the clock sequence value.
    * Predictable Timestamp Counter: Guessing how the timestamp counter increments.
**Predict MAC Address Component:** Attackers attempt to predict the MAC address embedded in the UUID.
    * Application runs on shared infrastructure with known MAC ranges: Exploiting predictable MAC ranges in shared environments.
    * MAC address is derived from predictable system information: Exploiting flaws in MAC address generation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Version 3/5 Predictability (Name-Based)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_version_35_predictability__name-based_.md)

**Predict Namespace UUID:** Guessing the namespace UUID used for generation.
**Predict Input String (Name):** Guessing the input string used for generation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Version 4 Predictability (Random-Based)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_version_4_predictability__random-based_.md)

**CRITICAL NODE: Weak Random Number Generator (RNG):** Exploiting a flawed or predictable random number generator used for Version 4 UUIDs.
    * Predictable Seed Value: Guessing the seed used to initialize the RNG.
    * Flaws in the RNG algorithm implementation: Exploiting inherent weaknesses in the RNG algorithm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Version 6/7 Predictability (Combined Time and Random)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_version_67_predictability__combined_time_and_random_.md)

**Exploit Time Component Predictability (Similar to Version 1):**  Predicting the time-based components of the UUID.
**Exploit Random Component Predictability (Similar to Version 4):** Predicting the random components of the UUID due to a weak RNG.
