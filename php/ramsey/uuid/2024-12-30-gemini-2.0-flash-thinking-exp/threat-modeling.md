*   **Threat:** Predictability of Version 3 and 5 UUIDs
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies the namespace and name used to generate Version 3 or 5 UUIDs. If these inputs are predictable or guessable, the attacker can regenerate the same UUIDs. This allows them to potentially access resources or perform actions associated with those UUIDs without proper authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Authorization Bypass, Information Disclosure (if the namespace or name reveals sensitive information).
    *   **Affected Component:** `Uuid::uuid3()` and `Uuid::uuid5()` functions (Version 3 and 5 UUID generation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unpredictable, and ideally secret namespaces and names when generating Version 3 or 5 UUIDs.
        *   Avoid using Version 3 or 5 UUIDs for security-critical identifiers if the input parameters cannot be kept secret.

*   **Threat:** Weak Random Number Generation for Version 4 UUIDs
    *   **Description:** If the underlying pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used by the system is weak or predictable, the generated Version 4 UUIDs might also become predictable. An attacker could potentially predict future UUIDs, allowing for resource enumeration or bypassing security measures.
    *   **Impact:** Predictability of UUIDs, potential for resource enumeration, authorization bypass.
    *   **Affected Component:** The system's underlying PRNG used by `ramsey/uuid` for Version 4 generation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the system has a properly seeded and cryptographically secure PRNG.
        *   Monitor for any signs of PRNG weakness or bias.
        *   Consider using alternative UUID generation methods if there are concerns about the system's PRNG.
