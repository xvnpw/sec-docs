# Threat Model Analysis for ramsey/uuid

## Threat: [Predictable Version 3 or 5 UUIDs due to Known Namespace or Name](./threats/predictable_version_3_or_5_uuids_due_to_known_namespace_or_name.md)

*   **Threat:** Predictable Version 3 or 5 UUIDs due to Known Namespace or Name
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers the namespace and name used by the application to generate Version 3 (MD5 hashing) or Version 5 (SHA-1 hashing) UUIDs using `ramsey/uuid`. Since these UUIDs are deterministically generated from the namespace and name, the attacker can generate the exact same UUIDs. This allows them to impersonate entities or gain unauthorized access if these UUIDs are used for identification or authorization within the application.
    *   **Impact:** High. If Version 3 or 5 UUIDs generated by `ramsey/uuid` are used for authentication, authorization, or access control, knowing the namespace and name allows attackers to bypass these security mechanisms, potentially leading to significant data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ramsey/uuid` Version 3 and 5 UUID generation functions (`Uuid::uuid3()`, `Uuid::uuid5()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use unpredictable and secret namespaces and names when generating Version 3 and 5 UUIDs with `ramsey/uuid`.
        *   Treat the namespace and name as sensitive secrets. Avoid hardcoding them directly in the application code.
        *   Consider using Version 4 UUIDs generated by `ramsey/uuid` if predictability is a major security concern and name-based generation is not strictly required.
