## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploiting Predictable Version 1 UUIDs:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploiting_predictable_version_1_uuids.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path exploits the structure of Version 1 UUIDs, which embed the host's MAC address and a timestamp. If an attacker can determine the MAC address and predict the timestamp, they can generate valid future UUIDs.

*   **Steps Involved:**
    *   **Leak MAC Address and Predict Node ID:** The attacker observes multiple generated Version 1 UUIDs. Since the Node ID (often the MAC address) remains relatively constant, patterns can be identified, potentially revealing the host's MAC address. Knowledge of common MAC address ranges or organizational assignments can further aid in prediction.
    *   **Predict Timestamp:** The attacker analyzes the timestamp component of observed UUIDs. By tracking the frequency of UUID generation, they can extrapolate the clock value and potentially predict future timestamp values. Weak randomness in the clock sequence counter can make this prediction easier.
    *   **[CRITICAL] Combine Predicted Node ID and Timestamp to Predict Future UUIDs:**  This is the critical step where the attacker combines the predicted MAC address (or Node ID) and timestamp to construct likely future UUID values.

*   **Potential Impact:**  Successfully predicting future UUIDs allows an attacker to:
    *   **Impersonate valid users or entities:** If UUIDs are used as identifiers for user sessions or other entities.
    *   **Access resources that will be created in the future:** If UUIDs are used to identify future resources before they are actually created.
    *   **Bypass access controls:** If UUIDs are used as authorization tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Misuse of UUIDs in Application Logic:](./attack_tree_paths/2__misuse_of_uuids_in_application_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application developers use UUIDs, rather than inherent weaknesses in the UUID generation itself.

*   **Insecure Storage or Transmission of UUIDs:**

    *   **Attack Vector:**  UUIDs, intended as unique identifiers, are treated as secrets or access tokens and are exposed in insecure ways.

    *   **[CRITICAL] UUIDs used in URLs without proper protection (e.g., predictable identifiers):**
        *   **Steps Involved:** The application includes UUIDs directly in URLs as a means to identify or access resources. If these UUIDs are predictable (e.g., Version 1 where prediction is possible) or even if they are random but exposed without proper authorization checks, attackers can exploit this.
        *   **Potential Impact:**
            *   **Direct access to unauthorized resources:** By manipulating or guessing UUIDs in the URL, attackers can directly access resources they should not have permission to view or modify.
            *   **Enumeration of resources:** Attackers can systematically try different UUIDs to discover and access a range of resources.

*   **Incorrect Use of UUIDs for Authorization or Authentication:**

    *   **Attack Vector:** The application relies solely on the secrecy or unpredictability of UUIDs for authorization or authentication purposes, without implementing additional security measures.

    *   **Steps Involved:** If UUIDs are used as the *only* factor to determine if a user or request is authorized, an attacker who can obtain or predict a valid UUID can bypass the authentication/authorization process.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   **Complete bypass of authentication:** Attackers can impersonate legitimate users without providing any valid credentials.
        *   **Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality:**  Attackers can gain full access to the application's resources and operations.
