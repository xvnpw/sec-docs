## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.1.a] Gain unauthorized access by predicting UUID-based tokens/identifiers](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1_a__gain_unauthorized_access_by_predicting_uuid-based_tokensidentifiers.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the system's Random Number Generator (RNG) is weak, UUIDs might become predictable. If UUIDs are used as security tokens (e.g., password reset tokens, API keys, access tokens), an attacker could predict future UUIDs and gain unauthorized access by using a predicted token.
    * **Estimations:**
        * Likelihood: Low-Medium (Depends on system RNG quality)
        * Impact: High (Unauthorized Access, Data Breach)
        * Effort: Medium (Requires analysis tools, scripting)
        * Skill Level: Medium (Understanding of RNGs, statistical analysis)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Monitoring UUID patterns, anomaly detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.1.b] Forge UUIDs to bypass security checks](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1_b__forge_uuids_to_bypass_security_checks.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Similar to the previous path, if UUIDs are predictable due to a weak RNG, an attacker could forge UUIDs to bypass security checks. For example, if UUIDs are used as object identifiers and authorization is based on UUID validity, a forged UUID might bypass these checks.
    * **Estimations:**
        * Likelihood: Low-Medium (Depends on system RNG quality)
        * Impact: High (Security Bypass, Privilege Escalation)
        * Effort: Medium (Requires analysis tools, scripting)
        * Skill Level: Medium (Understanding of RNGs, security mechanisms)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Monitoring UUID usage, access logs)

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.2.1] Inadequate collision detection in application logic](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2_1__inadequate_collision_detection_in_application_logic.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Even though UUID collisions are extremely rare, if the application logic doesn't handle potential collision scenarios gracefully, it could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This could manifest as data corruption, incorrect data association, or denial of service if the application crashes or enters an error state.
    * **Estimations:**
        * Likelihood: Low (Good libraries handle UUID generation well, but application logic can be flawed)
        * Impact: Medium (Data integrity issues, unexpected behavior)
        * Effort: Medium (Requires understanding application logic, potential race conditions)
        * Skill Level: Medium (Application security, concurrency issues)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Functional testing, code review, monitoring for anomalies)

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.2.1.a] Application fails to handle rare collision scenarios gracefully](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2_1_a__application_fails_to_handle_rare_collision_scenarios_gracefully.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specific instance of inadequate collision detection where the application's error handling or fallback mechanisms are insufficient when a collision (or logical equivalent) occurs.
        * **Estimations:** (Same as [3.2.1])

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.2.1.b] Data integrity issues due to mishandled collisions](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2_1_b__data_integrity_issues_due_to_mishandled_collisions.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specific instance of inadequate collision detection resulting in data corruption or inconsistent data states due to the application's failure to properly manage potential non-uniqueness.
        * **Estimations:** (Same as [3.2.1])

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.2.2] Race Conditions in UUID-based operations](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2_2__race_conditions_in_uuid-based_operations.md)

* **Attack Vector:** In concurrent environments, race conditions can occur when multiple operations attempt to use or modify data associated with the same UUID simultaneously. This can lead to data corruption, inconsistent state, or denial of service if critical operations are disrupted. Exploiting race conditions becomes more relevant if the application logic assumes absolute UUID uniqueness without proper concurrency controls.
    * **Estimations:**
        * Likelihood: Low-Medium (Depends on application concurrency design)
        * Impact: Medium-High (Data corruption, DoS, inconsistent state)
        * Effort: Medium (Requires understanding application concurrency, timing attacks)
        * Skill Level: Medium (Concurrency, race condition exploitation)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium-High (Concurrency testing, timing analysis, monitoring for race conditions)

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.2.2.a] Exploit race conditions when multiple operations use the same (or colliding) UUID](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2_2_a__exploit_race_conditions_when_multiple_operations_use_the_same__or_colliding__uuid.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Specific instance of race condition exploitation focusing on scenarios where multiple operations interact with the same UUID-identified resource concurrently.
            * **Estimations:** (Same as [3.2.2])

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.2.2.a.1] Data manipulation or denial of service](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2_2_a_1__data_manipulation_or_denial_of_service.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The outcome of exploiting race conditions in UUID-based operations, leading to either data manipulation (unintended changes, data corruption) or denial of service (application instability, crashes).
                * **Estimations:** (Same as [3.2.2])

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.1] Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) using UUIDs](./attack_tree_paths/_5_1__insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__using_uuids.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If UUIDs are used as direct object references in URLs or API endpoints without proper authorization, attackers can attempt to guess or enumerate UUIDs to access resources they are not authorized to view or modify. For example, changing a UUID in a URL might grant access to another user's profile or data.
    * **Estimations:**
        * Likelihood: Medium (Common web application vulnerability if UUIDs are used as direct references without authz)
        * Impact: High (Unauthorized access to sensitive data)
        * Effort: Low (Simple web request manipulation, browser tools)
        * Skill Level: Low (Basic web security knowledge)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Access control testing, authorization checks, anomaly detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.1.1] Guess or enumerate UUIDs to access unauthorized resources](./attack_tree_paths/_5_1_1__guess_or_enumerate_uuids_to_access_unauthorized_resources.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Specific tactic within IDOR attacks, where the attacker attempts to discover valid UUIDs through guessing or enumeration techniques to access unauthorized resources.
            * **Estimations:** (Same as [5.1])

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.1.1.a] Access sensitive data by manipulating UUID parameters](./attack_tree_paths/_5_1_1_a__access_sensitive_data_by_manipulating_uuid_parameters.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The direct consequence of successful IDOR exploitation, resulting in the attacker gaining access to sensitive data by manipulating UUID parameters in requests.
                * **Estimations:** (Same as [5.1])

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.1.2] Lack of proper authorization checks based on UUIDs](./attack_tree_paths/_5_1_2__lack_of_proper_authorization_checks_based_on_uuids.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The root cause of IDOR vulnerabilities. The application fails to implement sufficient authorization checks to verify if the user making the request is authorized to access the resource identified by the UUID.
        * **Estimations:**
            * Likelihood: Medium-High (Common web application vulnerability, authorization often overlooked)
            * Impact: High (Unauthorized access, privilege escalation)
            * Effort: Low (Simple web request manipulation, browser tools)
            * Skill Level: Low (Basic web security knowledge)
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Access control testing, authorization checks, anomaly detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.1.2.a] Bypass access controls by providing valid but unauthorized UUIDs](./attack_tree_paths/_5_1_2_a__bypass_access_controls_by_providing_valid_but_unauthorized_uuids.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  The direct exploitation of missing authorization checks, where an attacker provides a valid UUID (but one they are not authorized to access) and the application incorrectly grants access.
                * **Estimations:** (Same as [5.1.2])

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.2.1.a] Gain unauthorized access to user accounts (Session Fixation/Prediction using UUIDs as Session IDs)](./attack_tree_paths/_5_2_1_a__gain_unauthorized_access_to_user_accounts__session_fixationprediction_using_uuids_as_sessi_243cc65c.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If UUIDs are mistakenly or insecurely used as session identifiers, attackers might attempt to predict or fix session UUIDs. Session fixation occurs when an attacker forces a known session UUID onto a user. Session prediction involves guessing valid session UUIDs to hijack active sessions. Both lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
    * **Estimations:**
        * Likelihood: Low (Hopefully developers don't use UUIDs directly as session IDs, but possible misuse)
        * Impact: High (Account Takeover, Unauthorized Access)
        * Effort: Medium (Session analysis, potentially prediction attempts)
        * Skill Level: Medium (Session management, web security)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium (Session monitoring, anomaly detection, secure session management practices)

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.3] Inconsistent UUID Handling across Application Components](./attack_tree_paths/_5_3__inconsistent_uuid_handling_across_application_components.md)

* **Attack Vector:** In complex applications, especially microservice architectures, different components might handle UUIDs inconsistently. This could involve variations in validation rules, interpretation, or security enforcement. Attackers can exploit these inconsistencies to bypass security checks in one component by crafting UUIDs that are accepted by that component but rejected or misinterpreted by another component responsible for security.
    * **Estimations:**
        * Likelihood: Low-Medium (Larger applications, especially with microservices, can have inconsistencies)
        * Impact: Medium-High (Security bypass, data manipulation, inconsistent state)
        * Effort: Medium (Application analysis, inter-component communication analysis)
        * Skill Level: Medium (Application architecture, security mechanisms)
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium-High (Code review, integration testing, security audits)

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.3.1] Different interpretations or validation of UUIDs in different parts of the application](./attack_tree_paths/_5_3_1__different_interpretations_or_validation_of_uuids_in_different_parts_of_the_application.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The underlying issue of inconsistent handling, where different components apply varying rules or logic to UUIDs.
            * **Estimations:** (Same as [5.3])

## Attack Tree Path: [[5.3.1.a] Bypass security checks in one component by exploiting inconsistencies in another](./attack_tree_paths/_5_3_1_a__bypass_security_checks_in_one_component_by_exploiting_inconsistencies_in_another.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The direct exploitation of inconsistent UUID handling to circumvent security measures implemented in one part of the application by leveraging weaknesses in another part's UUID processing.
                * **Estimations:** (Same as [5.3])
