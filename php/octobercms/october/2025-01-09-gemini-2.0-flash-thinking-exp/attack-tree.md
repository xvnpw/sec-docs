## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE: Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugintheme_vulnerabilities__critical_node_plugintheme_vulnerabilities_.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Plugins/Themes:**
*   Attackers identify publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in installed OctoberCMS plugins or themes.
*   They leverage readily available exploit code or tools to target these known weaknesses.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   Database access and data breaches.
    *   Website defacement or redirection.
    *   Account compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Plugin/Theme](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_plugintheme.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Weak Access Controls in Backend:**
*   Attackers gain unauthorized access to the OctoberCMS backend administration panel. This can be achieved through:
    *   Exploiting weak or default administrative credentials.
    *   Credential stuffing or brute-force attacks.
    *   Phishing or social engineering tactics targeting administrators.
*   Once authenticated, attackers can upload a specially crafted malicious plugin or theme containing:
    *   Web shells for remote command execution.
    *   Backdoors for persistent access.
    *   Code to steal sensitive data.
    *   Functionality to further compromise the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OctoberCMS Core Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE: OctoberCMS Core Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_octobercms_core_vulnerabilities__critical_node_octobercms_core_vulnerabilities_.md)

**[HIGH RISK PATH] Authentication/Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE: Authentication System, Authorization System]:**
*   Attackers exploit flaws in the core OctoberCMS authentication mechanisms to bypass login procedures. This could involve:
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in password reset functionalities.
    *   Session hijacking or fixation vulnerabilities.
    *   Bypassing two-factor authentication if implemented insecurely.
*   Attackers exploit flaws in the core OctoberCMS authorization system to gain access to resources or functionalities they are not intended to access. This could involve:
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in role-based access control (RBAC) implementations.
    *   Manipulating user roles or permissions.
    *   Accessing administrative functionalities without proper authorization.

**[HIGH RISK PATH] Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE: Remote Code Execution]:**
*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in File Handling/Uploads:**
    *   Attackers exploit insecure file upload functionalities in OctoberCMS core or plugins.
    *   They upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) disguised as legitimate file types or by bypassing file type validation.
    *   These uploaded files can then be accessed directly or indirectly, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**[HIGH RISK PATH] SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE: Database Queries]:**
*   Attackers identify and exploit vulnerable database queries within the OctoberCMS core or plugins.
*   They inject malicious SQL code into input fields that are not properly sanitized or parameterized.
*   Successful SQL injection can lead to:
    *   Retrieval of sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, personal information).
    *   Modification or deletion of data within the database.
    *   In some cases, achieving Remote Code Execution by leveraging database functionalities.
