# Attack Surface Analysis for octobercms/october

## Attack Surface: [Backend Panel Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/backend_panel_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the authentication mechanisms or access control within the OctoberCMS admin panel.
    *   **How October Contributes:** OctoberCMS provides a built-in admin panel. Vulnerabilities in its authentication logic or authorization checks can be exploited.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker brute-forces default or weak administrator credentials, gaining access to the backend. Alternatively, a flaw in the authorization system allows a user with lower privileges to access sensitive admin functionalities within the core OctoberCMS system.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the website, data manipulation within the OctoberCMS database, installation of malicious plugins/themes, user data compromise managed by OctoberCMS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for administrator accounts within OctoberCMS.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the admin panel of OctoberCMS.
        *   Regularly review and restrict user roles and permissions within the OctoberCMS backend.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts to the OctoberCMS admin panel.
        *   Keep OctoberCMS core updated to benefit from security patches addressing authentication and authorization flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads in the Backend](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads_in_the_backend.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities allowing the upload of malicious files (e.g., PHP shells) through the OctoberCMS backend, which can then be executed on the server.
    *   **How October Contributes:** OctoberCMS's media manager functionality allows file uploads by authenticated administrators. If not properly secured by the OctoberCMS core, this can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An administrator (or an attacker who has compromised an admin account) uses the OctoberCMS media manager to upload a PHP script disguised as an image, which then grants remote access to the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, access to files managed by OctoberCMS, potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict file upload types allowed by the OctoberCMS media manager to only necessary and safe formats.
        *   Implement server-side validation of file types and content within the OctoberCMS upload handling, not just relying on client-side checks.
        *   Ensure OctoberCMS stores uploaded files outside of the webroot or in directories with restricted execution permissions.
        *   OctoberCMS should rename uploaded files to prevent direct execution.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Twig](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_twig.md)

*   **Description:**  If user-controlled input is directly embedded into Twig templates without proper sanitization within the OctoberCMS framework or its core components, attackers can inject malicious code that is executed on the server.
    *   **How October Contributes:** OctoberCMS uses the Twig templating engine extensively. Vulnerabilities can arise if OctoberCMS core code or its official components improperly handle user input within Twig templates.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in an OctoberCMS core feature allows an attacker to inject malicious Twig code that executes system commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, ability to manipulate the OctoberCMS application and its data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the OctoberCMS core and its official components avoid directly embedding user-supplied data into Twig templates without proper sanitization.
        *   OctoberCMS developers should use secure methods for rendering user-provided content within Twig templates, such as allowing only a predefined set of safe tags or attributes.
        *   Regularly audit the OctoberCMS core codebase for potential SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in how OctoberCMS downloads, verifies, and applies updates.
    *   **How October Contributes:** OctoberCMS provides a built-in update mechanism. If this process is vulnerable, attackers could potentially inject malicious code during an update of the OctoberCMS core.
    *   **Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack during an OctoberCMS core update process and replaces the legitimate update package with a malicious one.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the server after a seemingly legitimate OctoberCMS update.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that OctoberCMS updates are always downloaded over HTTPS.
        *   OctoberCMS should rigorously verify the integrity and authenticity of update packages using strong digital signatures.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Backend](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_backend.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within the OctoberCMS admin panel allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other administrators.
    *   **How October Contributes:** If the OctoberCMS core does not properly sanitize user input before displaying it within the admin interface, XSS vulnerabilities can be introduced.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a field within the OctoberCMS backend. When another administrator views this content, the script executes, potentially stealing their session cookie for the OctoberCMS admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking of administrator accounts, leading to full control over the OctoberCMS application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper output encoding and escaping for all user-supplied data displayed within the OctoberCMS admin panel.
        *   Utilize OctoberCMS's built-in security helpers for output encoding within the backend.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the OctoberCMS admin panel to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
