# Threat Model Analysis for octobercms/october

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker tricks an administrator into installing a plugin containing malicious code. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breach, website defacement, denial of service, persistent backdoors.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin System, Backend Plugin Installation
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Only install plugins from the official OctoberCMS Marketplace or highly trusted developers.
        *   **Developer Reputation Check:** Thoroughly research plugin developers before installation.
        *   **Code Review (Critical Plugins):** For essential plugins, review the code for suspicious activity before deployment.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run OctoberCMS with minimal necessary user privileges.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation (Code Injection)](./threats/plugin_vulnerability_exploitation__code_injection_.md)

*   **Threat:** Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation (Code Injection)
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit code injection flaws (SQL Injection, PHP Code Injection) in poorly coded plugins. This allows them to execute arbitrary code or database queries, potentially gaining control of the application and data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, website defacement, denial of service, potential server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Vulnerable Plugin, Plugin Controllers, Models, Views
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Reputable Plugin Sources:** Prioritize plugins from well-known and security-conscious developers.
        *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Immediately apply plugin updates to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Regularly audit and test plugin security, especially those handling sensitive data.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Plugin Developers):** Plugin developers must implement robust input sanitization and output encoding.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can block some injection attempts.

## Threat: [Theme Vulnerability Exploitation (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./threats/theme_vulnerability_exploitation__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

*   **Threat:** Theme Vulnerability Exploitation (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit XSS vulnerabilities in themes, often due to improper handling of user input in Twig templates or JavaScript. This can lead to account hijacking, especially if an administrator account is compromised via backend XSS, or theft of user session data.
    *   **Impact:** Account hijacking (including admin accounts), session theft, website defacement, malicious redirects, user data theft.
    *   **Affected Component:** Theme Templates (Twig), Theme JavaScript Files
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Theme Sources:** Choose themes from reputable sources and review code before use.
        *   **Regular Theme Updates:** Keep themes updated to patch security flaws.
        *   **Template Security Review:** Review Twig templates for proper output encoding and sanitization.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP to limit the impact of XSS.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Theme Developers):** Theme developers must sanitize input and encode output in themes.

## Threat: [OctoberCMS Core Vulnerability Exploitation (Authentication Bypass)](./threats/octobercms_core_vulnerability_exploitation__authentication_bypass_.md)

*   **Threat:** OctoberCMS Core Vulnerability Exploitation (Authentication Bypass)
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the OctoberCMS core authentication system to bypass login and gain unauthorized backend access. This grants full control over the CMS and its data.
    *   **Impact:** Full backend access, data breach, data manipulation, website defacement, complete application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** OctoberCMS Core Authentication System, Backend Security
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Core Updates:** Apply OctoberCMS core updates as soon as they are released, especially security updates.
        *   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor OctoberCMS security advisories for critical vulnerability information.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Regularly test the application for core vulnerabilities.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect some authentication bypass attempts.
        *   **Strong Passwords & 2FA:** Enforce strong passwords and implement two-factor authentication for backend access.

## Threat: [Exposed Backend Panel (Brute-Force & Credential Stuffing)](./threats/exposed_backend_panel__brute-force_&_credential_stuffing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposed Backend Panel (Brute-Force & Credential Stuffing)
    *   **Description:** The publicly accessible OctoberCMS backend panel is targeted by brute-force attacks or credential stuffing attempts. Attackers try to guess administrator credentials to gain unauthorized backend access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized backend access, data breach, data manipulation, website defacement, complete application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** OctoberCMS Backend Panel, Backend Login Functionality
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Passwords & Account Security:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all backend accounts.
        *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA for all backend users.
        *   **IP Whitelisting/Access Restrictions:** Restrict backend access to trusted IP addresses or networks.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on backend login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious login attempts.
