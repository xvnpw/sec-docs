# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, OctoberCMS, is a free, open-source, self-hosted content management system (CMS) based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Its primary business goal is to provide a user-friendly and flexible platform for building and managing websites and web applications. It targets web developers, designers, and content creators who need a robust and customizable CMS solution.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a stable and reliable CMS platform.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for content management.
- Enable customization and extensibility through themes and plugins.
- Foster a strong community and ecosystem around the CMS.
- Maintain the open-source nature of the project.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the core CMS or plugins could damage user trust and reputation.
- Lack of community support or developer contributions could hinder project growth and maintenance.
- Competition from other CMS platforms could reduce market share.
- Changes in underlying technologies (PHP, Laravel) could require significant updates and refactoring.
- Hosting and infrastructure costs for the project's website and services.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Regular security updates and patches for the core CMS (described in release notes and security advisories on the OctoberCMS website and GitHub).
- security control: Input validation and sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities (likely implemented throughout the codebase, but specific details would require code review).
- security control: Protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks (likely implemented through templating engine and output encoding, but specific details would require code review).
- security control: Protection against SQL Injection attacks (likely mitigated by Laravel's Eloquent ORM and parameterized queries, but specific details would require code review).
- security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms for backend access (implemented within the OctoberCMS core, details in documentation and codebase).
- security control: Password hashing for user accounts (likely using bcrypt or similar strong hashing algorithms, details in codebase).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community-developed plugins and themes introduces potential security risks if these extensions are not properly vetted.
- accepted risk: Self-hosted nature means users are responsible for securing their own hosting environment and keeping the CMS updated.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities can be publicly disclosed before patches are available.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the development and release pipeline.
- security control: Establish a formal security vulnerability reporting and response process.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing or security audits by external security experts.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for plugin and theme developers.
- security control: Implement a plugin/theme review process to identify and mitigate security risks in extensions.
- security control: Encourage or enforce the use of Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and brute-force protection for login attempts.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies, including Laravel and PHP, to address known vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanism for backend users (administrators, editors).
    - requirement: Support for strong passwords and password complexity requirements.
    - requirement: Option for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance login security.
    - requirement: Secure session management to prevent session hijacking.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to different CMS features.
    - requirement: Granular permissions to control access to specific content and functionalities.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to user roles and permissions.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation for all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    - requirement: Server-side validation should be enforced.
    - requirement: Use of parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection.
    - requirement: Output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data, such as passwords, using strong encryption or hashing algorithms.
    - requirement: Use of HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - requirement: Consider encryption for sensitive data at rest in the database.
