        2.  **Modify `backendUri` Setting:** Change the `backendUri` configuration option to a non-default, less predictable path. For example: `'backendUri' => '/admin-panel',`.
        3.  **Test Backend Access:** After changing the URI, verify that you can still access the backend using the new URI and that the default `/backend` path is no longer accessible.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Brute-Force Attacks on Backend Login - Severity: Medium
        *   Automated Attacks Targeting Default Backend Path - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Brute-Force Attacks on Backend Login: Low reduction. Primarily reduces automated attacks targeting the default path, but doesn't eliminate brute-force risk entirely. Rate limiting and strong passwords are more effective.
        *   Automated Attacks Targeting Default Backend Path: Moderate reduction. Makes it harder for automated scripts to find the backend login page.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No - Default `/backend` URI is used.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Change the `backendUri` in `config/cms.php` to a non-default value.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting on Backend Login](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_on_backend_login.md)

**Description:**
        1.  **Web Server Configuration (e.g., Nginx, Apache):** Configure rate limiting rules at the web server level to limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a specific time frame for the OctoberCMS backend login path (e.g., the path defined by `backendUri` in `config/cms.php`).
        2.  **OctoberCMS Plugin (if available):** Explore if any OctoberCMS plugins provide rate limiting functionality for backend login attempts.
        3.  **Test Rate Limiting:** After configuration, test the rate limiting mechanism to ensure it effectively blocks excessive login attempts without hindering legitimate users.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Brute-Force Attacks on Backend Login - Severity: High
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) attempts on Backend Login - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Brute-Force Attacks on Backend Login: High reduction. Significantly hinders brute-force password attacks by limiting login attempts.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) attempts on Backend Login: Moderate reduction. Can mitigate simple DoS attempts targeting the login page.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No - Rate limiting is not implemented on the backend login.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement rate limiting on the OctoberCMS backend login path, preferably at the web server level.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Backend Access](./mitigation_strategies/two-factor_authentication__2fa__for_backend_access.md)

**Description:**
        1.  **Choose an OctoberCMS 2FA Plugin:** Select a suitable two-factor authentication plugin from the OctoberCMS Marketplace or a trusted source.
        2.  **Install and Configure 2FA Plugin:** Install the chosen plugin through the OctoberCMS backend and configure it according to the plugin's documentation.
        3.  **Enable 2FA for Backend Users:** Enable two-factor authentication for all backend user accounts, especially administrator accounts.
        4.  **User Training:** Provide training to backend users on how to set up and use two-factor authentication.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Brute-Force Attacks on Backend Login - Severity: High
        *   Password Compromise - Severity: High
        *   Unauthorized Backend Access - Severity: High
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Brute-Force Attacks on Backend Login: High reduction. Makes brute-force attacks extremely difficult to succeed.
        *   Password Compromise: High reduction. Even if passwords are compromised, 2FA prevents unauthorized access without the second factor.
        *   Unauthorized Backend Access: High reduction. Significantly strengthens backend access security.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** No - Two-factor authentication is not implemented for backend access.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement two-factor authentication for all OctoberCMS backend users using a suitable plugin.
