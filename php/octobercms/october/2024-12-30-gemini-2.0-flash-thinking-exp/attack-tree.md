**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise OctoberCMS Application [CRITICAL]:**
    *   This is the ultimate goal. Success here means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access and control.

*   **Exploit OctoberCMS Core Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers target weaknesses in the core OctoberCMS framework.
    *   This often involves exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific versions.

*   **Exploit Known Core Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the OctoberCMS core.
    *   This is often facilitated by readily available exploit code.

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers aim to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   This can be achieved through vulnerabilities like insecure deserialization or flaws in file handling within the core or plugins.

*   **SQL Injection [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries.
    *   This can occur due to insufficient input sanitization in the core framework's database interactions.

*   **Exploit Plugin/Theme Vulnerability [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers target vulnerabilities within third-party plugins or themes used by the application.
    *   These vulnerabilities can arise from poor coding practices or lack of security updates in the extensions.

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in Specific Plugin/Theme [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers focus on exploiting known or newly discovered vulnerabilities in a particular plugin or theme.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   In the context of plugins, this often occurs due to improper handling of user input or insecure templating within the plugin's components.

*   **Compromise Update Server [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers gain unauthorized access to the OctoberCMS update infrastructure.
    *   This allows them to distribute malicious updates to all applications using OctoberCMS, leading to widespread compromise.

*   **Exploit Insecure File Handling/Storage:**
    *   Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the application handles and stores files.

*   **Directory Traversal:**
    *   Attackers manipulate file paths to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot.
    *   This can be achieved through vulnerabilities in file upload or access mechanisms.

*   **Arbitrary File Upload [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers bypass restrictions to upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts, to the server.
    *   This often leads to Remote Code Execution.

*   **Exploit Insecure Configuration:**
    *   Attackers take advantage of misconfigurations in the application's settings.

*   **Access Sensitive Configuration Files [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to read configuration files.
    *   These files often contain sensitive information like database credentials or API keys.

*   **Default Credentials [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers attempt to log in using default usernames and passwords that were not changed after installation.
    *   This often targets the admin panel or database access.

*   **Exploit Insecure Admin Panel Access [CRITICAL]:**
    *   Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the administrative interface of the application.

*   **Brute-Force Attack:**
    *   Attackers systematically try different username and password combinations to guess the correct credentials for the admin panel.

*   **Credential Stuffing:**
    *   Attackers use lists of previously compromised usernames and passwords (obtained from other breaches) to attempt to log in to the admin panel.

*   **Session Hijacking:**
    *   Attackers steal or predict valid session IDs of authenticated administrators.
    *   This allows them to impersonate the administrator without knowing their actual credentials.
