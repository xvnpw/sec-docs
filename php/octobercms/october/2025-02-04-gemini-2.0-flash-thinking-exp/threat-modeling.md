* Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

## Threat: [Exposure of Backup Files](./threats/exposure_of_backup_files.md)

**Description:** OctoberCMS backup files are stored insecurely in publicly accessible locations, allowing attackers to download them.
**Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information from backups, potential to restore to vulnerable application state.
**Affected Component:** Backup Procedures, File Storage
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store backups in secure, non-publicly accessible locations.
* Encrypt backup files.
* Implement access controls on backup storage.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Plugins/Themes](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_pluginsthemes.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit authorization flaws in plugins/themes to bypass access controls and perform unauthorized actions.
**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, modification of website functionality, potentially remote code execution.
**Affected Component:** Third-party Plugins and Themes, specific plugin/theme code
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review plugin/theme code for authorization vulnerabilities.
* Use secure authorization patterns in plugins/themes.
