# Attack Surface Analysis for octobercms/october

## Attack Surface: [1. Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/1__vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party plugins can contain security vulnerabilities due to coding errors, lack of security awareness, or outdated dependencies.
*   **October Contribution:** OctoberCMS's plugin ecosystem relies on community contributions, and the core framework doesn't inherently guarantee plugin security. Users are responsible for selecting secure plugins.
*   **Example:** A plugin for e-commerce has an SQL injection vulnerability, allowing attackers to steal customer data or gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, website defacement, Remote Code Execution (RCE), full website compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Plugin Auditing:** Conduct thorough security audits of plugins before deployment and regularly thereafter.
    *   **Prioritize Reputable Plugins:** Choose plugins from well-known and trusted developers with a history of security awareness.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only install essential plugins to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Continuous Plugin Updates:** Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Scanning:** Utilize security scanners to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in plugins.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unmaintained Plugins with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__unmaintained_plugins_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Plugins that are no longer actively maintained may contain known, unpatched vulnerabilities, making them easy targets for exploitation.
*   **October Contribution:** The OctoberCMS marketplace can host plugins that are abandoned, leaving users vulnerable if they continue to use them.
*   **Example:** An unmaintained blog plugin has a publicly disclosed Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Websites using this plugin are easily compromised.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full website compromise, data breaches, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Identify and Replace:** Proactively identify unmaintained plugins and replace them with actively maintained and secure alternatives.
    *   **Disable or Remove:** If no secure alternative exists, disable or completely remove the unmaintained plugin to eliminate the vulnerability.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in installed plugins, especially unmaintained ones.
    *   **Consider Forking (Advanced):** As a last resort, for critical functionality, consider forking and maintaining the plugin yourself to address security issues.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unrestricted File Uploads via Plugins or Core Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/3__unrestricted_file_uploads_via_plugins_or_core_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerable file upload functionality allows attackers to upload malicious files, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution.
*   **October Contribution:** OctoberCMS provides file upload capabilities. Misconfigurations in core settings or vulnerabilities in plugins handling file uploads can create unrestricted upload points.
*   **Example:** A plugin allows file uploads without proper validation. An attacker uploads a PHP web shell, gains access to the server, and compromises the entire application.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full website compromise, data breaches, website defacement, server takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation:** Implement robust file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) and not just file extensions.
    *   **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web root to prevent direct execution via web requests.
    *   **Disable Script Execution in Uploads:** Configure the web server to prevent script execution in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` or web server configuration).
    *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent denial-of-service and resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit file upload functionalities in plugins and core configurations to ensure they are securely implemented.

## Attack Surface: [4. Weak Backend Authentication leading to Admin Panel Compromise](./attack_surfaces/4__weak_backend_authentication_leading_to_admin_panel_compromise.md)

*   **Description:**  Using weak or default credentials, or lacking strong authentication mechanisms for the OctoberCMS backend, allows attackers to gain administrative access.
*   **October Contribution:** OctoberCMS's backend security relies on strong authentication. Weaknesses in password policies or lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) directly expose the backend.
*   **Example:** An administrator uses a weak password. Attackers brute-force the login page and gain access to the admin panel, taking full control of the website.
*   **Impact:** Full website compromise, data breaches, website defacement, complete administrative control for attackers.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Implement and enforce strong password policies for all administrator accounts (complexity, length, regular changes).
    *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement and enforce MFA for all backend administrator accounts.
    *   **Account Lockout and Rate Limiting:** Implement account lockout mechanisms and rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit backend authentication configurations and practices to ensure they are secure.
    *   **Monitor Login Activity:** Monitor backend login activity for suspicious patterns and unauthorized access attempts.

## Attack Surface: [5. Insufficient Backend Access Control Leading to Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/5__insufficient_backend_access_control_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:**  Improperly configured backend roles and permissions can grant excessive privileges, allowing lower-privileged users to access sensitive administrative functionalities.
*   **October Contribution:** OctoberCMS's role-based access control system, if misconfigured, can lead to unintended privilege escalation.
*   **Example:** A user with a "Content Editor" role is mistakenly granted permissions to modify system settings or install plugins due to misconfigured roles, allowing them to escalate their privileges.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive configurations, potential for further system compromise, data manipulation, or website disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure backend roles and permissions strictly based on the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary access for their roles.
    *   **Regular Role and Permission Review:** Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions to ensure they are correctly configured and aligned with user responsibilities.
    *   **Custom Roles for Specific Needs:** Create custom roles tailored to specific user functions instead of relying solely on default roles, allowing for finer-grained control.
    *   **Thorough Testing of Permissions:** Thoroughly test role and permission configurations after any changes to ensure they function as intended and do not grant unintended access.
