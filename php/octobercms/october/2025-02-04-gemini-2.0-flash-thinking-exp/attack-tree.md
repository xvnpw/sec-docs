## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OctoberCMS Plugin Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_octobercms_plugin_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**1. Exploit OctoberCMS Plugin Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   OctoberCMS relies heavily on plugins for extending functionality.
    *   Plugins are often developed by third-party developers with varying levels of security expertise.
    *   Known vulnerabilities in popular or outdated plugins are frequently discovered and publicly disclosed.
    *   Attackers can easily identify installed plugins and their versions on a target OctoberCMS site.
    *   Exploits for known plugin vulnerabilities are often readily available or easy to develop.
*   **Critical Node: 2.1.4. Vulnerability Exploitation**
    *   This is the point where the attacker executes an exploit against a vulnerable plugin.
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including:
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.
        *   SQL Injection - allowing the attacker to access or modify the database.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - allowing the attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website.
        *   Local File Inclusion (LFI) - allowing the attacker to read sensitive files on the server.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   High likelihood due to the prevalence of plugin vulnerabilities.
        *   Critical impact as plugin vulnerabilities often lead to full system compromise.
        *   Relatively low effort and skill level to exploit known vulnerabilities.
        *   Detection can be challenging if the exploit is sophisticated or zero-day.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Theme-Based XSS (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_theme-based_xss__high-risk_path_.md)

**2. Exploit Theme-Based XSS (High-Risk Path)**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   OctoberCMS themes control the presentation layer and often handle user-generated content.
    *   If theme developers do not properly sanitize and escape user inputs before displaying them in templates, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through various input points (e.g., search forms, comments, URL parameters).
    *   When a user visits a page containing the injected script, the script executes in their browser within the context of the website.
*   **Critical Node: 3.1.3. XSS Exploitation**
    *   This is the point where the attacker leverages a confirmed XSS vulnerability to perform malicious actions.
    *   Common XSS exploitation techniques include:
        *   Session Hijacking - stealing user session cookies to impersonate users, including administrators.
        *   Website Defacement - altering the visual appearance of the website.
        *   Redirection to Malicious Sites - redirecting users to phishing pages or malware distribution sites.
        *   Keylogging - capturing user keystrokes.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   High likelihood due to common mistakes in theme development regarding input handling.
        *   Medium impact, can escalate to high if admin sessions are hijacked.
        *   Low effort and skill level to exploit basic XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Detection can be challenging for reflected XSS if not properly logged and monitored.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default or Weak Admin Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_or_weak_admin_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

**3. Exploit Default or Weak Admin Credentials (High-Risk Path)**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   If administrators choose weak passwords or fail to change default credentials (though default credentials are not typically set by OctoberCMS itself, weak passwords are common).
    *   Attackers can use brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess admin credentials.
    *   Once valid credentials are obtained, attackers can directly log in to the OctoberCMS admin panel.
*   **Critical Node: 4.1.3. Admin Panel Access**
    *   Gaining access to the OctoberCMS admin panel is a critical node as it grants extensive control over the application.
    *   With admin access, attackers can:
        *   Install and modify plugins and themes, leading to code execution.
        *   Modify website content and configuration.
        *   Access sensitive data stored in the database.
        *   Create new admin accounts for persistent access.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   Medium likelihood due to the persistent issue of weak passwords and password reuse.
        *   Critical impact as admin access grants full control.
        *   Low effort and skill level for basic brute-force or dictionary attacks.
        *   Detection can be improved with account lockout and login attempt monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Permissions leading to File Manipulation/Code Injection (Medium-High Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_permissions_leading_to_file_manipulationcode_injection__medium-high_risk_path_.md)

**4. Insecure File Permissions leading to File Manipulation/Code Injection (Medium-High Risk Path)**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Incorrectly configured file permissions on the server can allow unauthorized users (including web server processes) to write to sensitive directories.
    *   Commonly misconfigured directories include `storage/`, `uploads/`, and theme directories.
    *   If attackers can write to these directories, they can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) or modify existing application files.
    *   Uploaded or modified files can then be executed by the web server, leading to code execution.
*   **Critical Node: 4.3.2. File Manipulation/Code Injection**
    *   This is the point where the attacker successfully uploads or modifies files to inject malicious code.
    *   Successful code injection can lead to:
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server.
        *   Website Defacement - altering website files.
        *   Data Exfiltration - accessing and stealing sensitive data.
    *   **Why Medium-High Risk:**
        *   Medium likelihood as misconfigurations are common, but require some server-side access or vulnerability to exploit.
        *   High impact as code injection often leads to RCE.
        *   Medium effort and skill level to exploit writable directories and inject code.
        *   Detection can be improved with file integrity monitoring and proper permission audits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing for Admin Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_for_admin_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

**5. Phishing for Admin Credentials (High-Risk Path)**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attackers use social engineering techniques, primarily phishing emails, to trick OctoberCMS administrators into revealing their login credentials.
    *   Phishing emails often mimic legitimate OctoberCMS login pages or system notifications.
    *   Emails may contain links to fake login pages designed to steal credentials when entered.
    *   Attackers may also use other social engineering tactics to gain trust and extract credentials.
*   **Critical Node: 6.1.4. Admin Panel Access**
    *   Similar to weak credentials, gaining admin panel access via stolen credentials is a critical node.
    *   The consequences of admin panel access are the same as described in point 3 (plugin/theme modification, data access, etc.).
    *   **Why High-Risk:**
        *   High likelihood due to the effectiveness of phishing attacks against human targets.
        *   Critical impact as admin access grants full control.
        *   Low effort and skill level to launch phishing campaigns (tools are readily available).
        *   Detection relies heavily on user awareness and email security measures.
