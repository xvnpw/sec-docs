# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific compliance requirements for OctoberCMS deployments (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS)?
  - Are there specific industry verticals or use cases that OctoberCMS primarily targets, which might influence security priorities?
  - What is the process for security incident response and vulnerability disclosure for OctoberCMS?
  - Are there any existing security policies or guidelines for OctoberCMS development and deployment?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a widely adopted and trusted open-source CMS platform. Security and community trust are critical for achieving this goal.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: OctoberCMS follows common security practices for web applications and open-source projects. Security is a shared responsibility between the core team, plugin developers, and users.
  - DESIGN: The design assumes a typical three-tier web application architecture with web servers, application servers, and database servers. Deployment is flexible and can be adapted to various environments, including cloud and on-premise. Build process includes basic security checks but could be enhanced with more comprehensive automated security testing.
