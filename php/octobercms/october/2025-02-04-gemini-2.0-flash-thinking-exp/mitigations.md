*   **Impact:** **Medium Reduction** of risk. Log auditing provides visibility into backend activity *within OctoberCMS* and enables detection of security incidents, but it is reactive rather than preventative.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Backend logs are generated by OctoberCMS, but there is no regular, systematic audit process in place. Logs are reviewed reactively in case of suspected issues.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Establishment of a regular backend log audit schedule *for OctoberCMS*, definition of key events to monitor *in OctoberCMS backend logs*, and potentially implementation of automated log analysis and alerting *for OctoberCMS backend logs*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider Custom Backend URL (Security by Obscurity - Secondary Measure)](./mitigation_strategies/consider_custom_backend_url__security_by_obscurity_-_secondary_measure_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Consider Custom Backend URL
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify Backend URL:** Change the default backend URL (`/backend`) *of OctoberCMS* to a custom, less predictable URL. This can typically be configured in OctoberCMS's configuration files (e.g., `config/cms.php` or backend settings).
    2.  **Update Web Server Configuration (If Necessary):** If the custom backend URL requires web server configuration changes (e.g., for URL rewriting), update the web server configuration accordingly *for OctoberCMS*.
    3.  **Inform Authorized Users:** Communicate the new custom backend URL to all authorized backend users *of OctoberCMS*.
    4.  **Regularly Review:** Periodically review if the custom backend URL is still sufficiently obscure and consider changing it again if necessary (though frequent changes can be disruptive).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Automated Brute-Force Attacks (Low Severity):** Changing the default backend URL *of OctoberCMS* can deter some automated brute-force attacks that target the common `/backend` path.
    *   **Casual Unauthorized Access Attempts (Low Severity):** Makes it slightly harder for casual attackers or script kiddies to find the backend login page *of OctoberCMS*.
*   **Impact:** **Low Reduction** of risk. Security by obscurity is not a strong security measure. It should only be considered as a secondary, supplementary measure in conjunction with robust security practices *for OctoberCMS*. It does not protect against targeted attacks or determined attackers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. The default `/backend` URL is currently used *for OctoberCMS*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Configuration change to set a custom, less predictable backend URL *for OctoberCMS*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate File Uploads Thoroughly](./mitigation_strategies/validate_file_uploads_thoroughly.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Server-Side Validation (Mandatory):** Implement robust server-side validation for all file uploads *within OctoberCMS functionalities (e.g., Media Manager, Forms, Plugins)*. Do not rely solely on client-side validation, as it can be easily bypassed.
    2.  **File Type Validation:** Validate the file type based on the file extension and MIME type *in OctoberCMS file uploads*. Use an allowlist of permitted file extensions (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `.doc`) rather than a denylist. Verify MIME type against expected types.
    3.  **File Size Validation:** Enforce limits on file sizes *in OctoberCMS file uploads* to prevent denial-of-service attacks and resource exhaustion.
    4.  **File Content Validation:** For certain file types (e.g., images, documents), perform content validation to ensure the file is not corrupted or malicious *in OctoberCMS file uploads*. This could involve using libraries to parse and analyze file content.
    5.  **Filename Sanitization:** Sanitize uploaded filenames *in OctoberCMS file uploads* to remove or replace special characters, spaces, and potentially dangerous characters. Ensure filenames are safe for the operating system and file system.
    6.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for file upload validation failures *in OctoberCMS*. Provide informative error messages to users without revealing sensitive information.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious File Upload (High Severity):** Uploading malicious files (e.g., web shells, malware) *via OctoberCMS upload mechanisms* can lead to Remote Code Execution and system compromise.
    *   **Directory Traversal Attacks (Medium Severity):** Improper filename sanitization *in OctoberCMS file uploads* can allow directory traversal attacks, potentially overwriting or accessing sensitive files.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via File Upload (Medium Severity):** Uploading files with malicious content (e.g., SVG images with embedded JavaScript) *via OctoberCMS upload mechanisms* can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Uploading excessively large files *via OctoberCMS upload mechanisms* can lead to resource exhaustion and DoS.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** of risk. Thorough file upload validation is crucial to prevent various file-based attacks and ensure the integrity of uploaded data *within OctoberCMS*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic file type and size validation is implemented in some file upload functionalities *within OctoberCMS*, but not consistently across all upload points. Filename sanitization is performed in some areas, but not comprehensively.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent and comprehensive server-side validation for all file uploads across the application *within OctoberCMS functionalities*, including file type, size, content validation, and robust filename sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Filenames](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_filenames.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize Filenames
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Sanitization Rules:** Establish clear rules for sanitizing filenames *in OctoberCMS*. This typically involves:
        *   Removing or replacing special characters (e.g., `../`, `\`, `:`, `;`, `<`, `>`, `&`, `$`, `#`, `*`, `?`, `!`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `'`, `"`, `|`).
        *   Replacing spaces with underscores or hyphens.
        *   Converting filenames to lowercase (or consistently using a case convention).
        *   Limiting filename length.
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Function:** Create a reusable function or method in your application code *or within OctoberCMS plugins/themes* to sanitize filenames according to the defined rules.
    3.  **Apply Sanitization on Upload:** Apply the filename sanitization function to all uploaded filenames *in OctoberCMS* immediately after they are received by the server, before storing them.
    4.  **Test Sanitization:** Thoroughly test the filename sanitization function with various malicious and edge-case filenames to ensure it effectively removes or replaces dangerous characters and produces safe filenames *within the OctoberCMS context*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Directory Traversal Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from crafting filenames that can traverse directories and access or overwrite files outside the intended upload directory *within OctoberCMS file handling*.
    *   **File System Issues (Low Severity):** Sanitization helps prevent issues related to incompatible characters or filenames that could cause problems with the operating system or file system *when used within OctoberCMS*.
*   **Impact:** **Medium Reduction** of risk. Sanitizing filenames is a key step in preventing directory traversal attacks and ensuring file system compatibility *within OctoberCMS file operations*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Filename sanitization is performed in some file upload functionalities *within OctoberCMS*, but not consistently across all upload points.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent application of filename sanitization across all file upload functionalities *in OctoberCMS* and a clearly defined and documented filename sanitization policy *for OctoberCMS*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Store Uploaded Files Securely](./mitigation_strategies/store_uploaded_files_securely.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Store Uploaded Files Securely
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Store Outside Webroot (Recommended):** Ideally, store uploaded files *managed by OctoberCMS* outside of the webroot (the publicly accessible directory of the web server). This prevents direct execution of uploaded files as scripts.
    2.  **If Stored Within Webroot, Prevent Execution:** If files *managed by OctoberCMS* must be stored within the webroot, configure the web server to prevent execution of scripts in the upload directories. This can be achieved using:
        *   **`.htaccess` (Apache):** Add directives like `RemoveHandler .php .phtml .phps`, `RemoveType .php .phtml .phps`, and `AddType text/plain .php .phtml .phps` within a `.htaccess` file in the upload directory to prevent PHP execution.
        *   **Nginx Configuration:** Use `location` blocks in the Nginx configuration to deny execution of PHP and other script files in the upload directory.
    3.  **Randomize Filenames (Optional but Recommended):** Consider randomizing uploaded filenames *managed by OctoberCMS* (e.g., using UUIDs or hashes) to make it harder for attackers to guess file paths and directly access uploaded files.
    4.  **Restrict Directory Permissions:** Set restrictive directory permissions on the upload directories *used by OctoberCMS* to limit access to only the web server user and necessary processes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via File Upload (High Severity):** Preventing script execution in upload directories *used by OctoberCMS* is crucial to mitigate RCE vulnerabilities arising from malicious file uploads.
    *   **Direct File Access (Medium Severity):** Storing files outside the webroot or randomizing filenames makes it harder for attackers to directly access uploaded files *managed by OctoberCMS* without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** of risk. Secure file storage is essential to prevent RCE and unauthorized access to uploaded files *within the OctoberCMS context*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Files are stored within the webroot in some areas *of OctoberCMS file management*, and script execution prevention is not consistently enforced across all upload directories. In other areas, files are stored outside webroot.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent storage of uploaded files outside the webroot wherever feasible *within OctoberCMS file management*, and robust enforcement of script execution prevention for all upload directories within the webroot *used by OctoberCMS*.
