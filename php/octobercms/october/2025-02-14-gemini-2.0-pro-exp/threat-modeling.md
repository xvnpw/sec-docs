# Threat Model Analysis for octobercms/october

## Threat: [Outdated October CMS Core Exploitation](./threats/outdated_october_cms_core_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an outdated version of October CMS. The vulnerability might be publicly disclosed or discovered through automated scanning. This directly involves a flaw *within* October CMS itself.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution and complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable component within the October CMS core (e.g., a specific controller, model, or library – the exact component depends on the specific CVE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep October CMS updated to the latest stable version. This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   Subscribe to October CMS security advisories.
        *   Automate the update process (with appropriate testing and rollback capabilities).

## Threat: [Backend Brute-Force Attack](./threats/backend_brute-force_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess the username and password for an October CMS backend account (/backend) using automated tools. This targets the core authentication mechanism of October CMS.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the October CMS backend, allowing the attacker to modify content, install malicious plugins, exfiltrate data, and potentially gain full control of the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** October CMS Backend Authentication (`Backend\Controllers\Auth`, authentication logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for all backend users.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for backend access (via a plugin or custom implementation).
        *   Implement account lockout policies (e.g., lock the account after a certain number of failed login attempts).
        *   Monitor backend login logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Consider restricting backend access to specific IP addresses or using a VPN.

## Threat: [Misconfigured File Permissions (Impacting Core Functionality)](./threats/misconfigured_file_permissions__impacting_core_functionality_.md)

*   **Description:** Files and directories *essential to October CMS's core operation* have overly permissive permissions.  This isn't just about *any* file, but specifically those that, if compromised, would impact the core CMS functionality (e.g., configuration files in `config/`, core system files).
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (e.g., configuration files containing database credentials), potential for code modification or execution by the web server user, leading to privilege escalation and compromise of the core CMS.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core October CMS file system, specifically critical configuration and system files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow October CMS documentation *precisely* for recommended file and directory permissions.
        *   Regularly audit file permissions using automated tools, focusing on core system directories.
        *   Ensure that sensitive files (e.g., `config/*.php`, `.env`) are *not* readable by the web server user.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Unrestricted File Uploads (Media Manager - Abusing Core Functionality)](./threats/unrestricted_file_uploads__media_manager_-_abusing_core_functionality_.md)

*   **Description:** The October CMS Media Manager, a *core component*, is misconfigured to allow uploads of arbitrary file types, including executable files. An attacker uploads a malicious file and then accesses it directly, exploiting the *core* file handling mechanism. This is distinct from a vulnerable *plugin* that handles uploads; this is about the *built-in* Media Manager.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** October CMS Media Manager (`Cms\Classes\MediaLibrary`, file upload handling – specifically the core implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly configure the Media Manager (within the October CMS settings) to allow *only* necessary file types (e.g., images, documents).
        *   Validate file contents, not just extensions (e.g., using MIME type detection and file signature analysis). This is crucial for preventing bypasses.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the web root or in a directory that is protected from direct execution (configure this within October CMS).
        *   Use a virus scanner to scan uploaded files (this is a general security practice, but helps mitigate even if the core upload handling is flawed).
        *   Rename uploaded files to prevent direct access based on predictable filenames (a feature often available in media managers).
