# Attack Surface Analysis for octobercms/october

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads (via October CMS Features)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads__via_october_cms_features_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) using October CMS's media manager or file upload functionality within plugins/themes, leading to RCE.
*   **October CMS Contribution:** October's built-in file handling features, *if misused by developers or if plugins/themes have vulnerabilities*, create this attack vector. The framework *provides* validation tools, but their correct implementation is crucial.
*   **Example:** A poorly coded plugin using October's `FileUpload` component doesn't validate file types, allowing an attacker to upload a `.php` file and execute it.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:** Implement *strict* file type whitelisting (extension *and* content type) using October's validation rules. Validate *content*, not just extensions.
    *   **Safe Naming:** Use October's file renaming features to generate random, safe filenames.
    *   **Storage Outside Webroot:** Store uploads outside the webroot using October's storage system, serving them through controlled scripts.
    *   **Disable PHP Execution:** Configure the web server (via `.htaccess` or server config) to prevent PHP execution in upload directories managed by October.
    *   **Plugin Security:** *Thoroughly* vet any plugin using October's file upload features. Keep plugins updated.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins/Themes (October CMS Ecosystem)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_pluginsthemes__october_cms_ecosystem_.md)

*   **Description:** Plugins and themes from the October CMS marketplace or other sources contain vulnerabilities (known or zero-day) exploitable due to their integration with October.
*   **October CMS Contribution:** October's plugin and theme system is a core feature, creating a direct attack surface. The framework relies on third-party developers for security.
*   **Example:** A popular October CMS plugin for managing user roles has a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing attackers to gain admin access.
*   **Impact:** Varies (data breaches to server compromise), highly dependent on the specific plugin/theme vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Sources Only:** Install only from the official October CMS marketplace or highly reputable developers.
    *   **Code Review (if possible):** Examine plugin/theme code before installation, focusing on security-sensitive areas (input handling, database queries, etc.).
    *   **Aggressive Updates:** *Immediately* update plugins/themes upon release of security patches.
    *   **Minimize Plugins:** Use the absolute minimum number of plugins required.
    *   **Monitor Advisories:** Actively follow October CMS security announcements and plugin-specific vulnerability reports.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass (October CMS Backend)](./attack_surfaces/authenticationauthorization_bypass__october_cms_backend_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the October CMS `/backend` due to weak credentials, session flaws, or *misconfigured October CMS permissions*.
*   **October CMS Contribution:** October's backend and its permission system are core components. Misconfiguration or bugs in October's permission checks are the primary concern.
*   **Example:** An October CMS administrator account uses a weak password, or a custom plugin incorrectly implements October's permission checks, allowing privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:** Complete website control, data theft, potential server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Passwords & 2FA:** Enforce strong passwords and *require* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for *all* backend users.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** *Meticulously* configure October's user permissions, granting only the *minimum* necessary access.
    *   **Session Security:** Ensure October's session configuration uses `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. Review session timeout settings.
    *   **Brute-Force Protection:** Implement rate limiting (plugin, server-level, or WAF) specifically targeting the October CMS backend login.
    *   **Audit Permissions:** Regularly review and audit October CMS user roles and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection (October CMS Twig Environment)](./attack_surfaces/template_injection__october_cms_twig_environment_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Twig code into templates, exploiting October CMS's rendering process, potentially leading to server-side code execution.
*   **October CMS Contribution:** October's use of Twig as its templating engine creates this risk if user input is not *perfectly* handled within templates.
*   **Example:** A custom October CMS component renders user-supplied data directly in a Twig template without escaping, allowing an attacker to inject `{{ system('id') }}`.
*   **Impact:** Potential server-side code execution, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Twig Auto-Escaping:** *Always* use Twig's automatic escaping features. Ensure it's enabled and correctly applied.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize *all* user input *before* it reaches any Twig template. Use October's validation rules.
    *   **Contextual Escaping:** Use the *correct* Twig escaping strategy (HTML, JS, etc.) based on the output context.
    *   **No Dynamic Templates:** *Never* load Twig templates dynamically based on user input.
    * **Review Custom Components:** Carefully review any custom components that interact with Twig, paying close attention to how user input is handled.

## Attack Surface: [YAML Parsing Vulnerabilities (October CMS Configuration and Plugins)](./attack_surfaces/yaml_parsing_vulnerabilities__october_cms_configuration_and_plugins_.md)

*   **Description:** Unsafe parsing of YAML files, particularly within October CMS plugins or configurations that accept user input, can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **October CMS Contribution:** October CMS uses YAML for plugin configurations and other areas. If a plugin or a custom implementation allows user-supplied YAML, and it's parsed unsafely, this is a direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** A custom October CMS plugin allows users to upload a YAML file for configuration, and the plugin uses a vulnerable YAML parser, enabling RCE.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Safe YAML Parser:** *Exclusively* use a secure YAML parser (e.g., `symfony/yaml` with appropriate flags) that *prevents* arbitrary object instantiation.  *Never* use `yaml_parse()` with untrusted input.
    *   **Avoid User-Supplied YAML:** *Strongly* prefer alternative configuration methods that don't involve user-supplied YAML.
    *   **Strict Validation:** If user-supplied YAML is *unavoidable*, implement *extremely* strict validation of the YAML structure *before* parsing.
    *   **Sanitize Input:** If user input is embedded within YAML, sanitize it *thoroughly* to remove any potentially dangerous characters or constructs.
