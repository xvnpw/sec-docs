Okay, let's create a design document for OctoberCMS based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

OctoberCMS is a self-hosted Content Management System (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP framework.  The business priorities appear to be:

*   Provide a flexible and extensible CMS platform for developers and content creators.
*   Offer a simple and intuitive user interface for managing content.
*   Enable rapid website development and deployment.
*   Foster a strong community and ecosystem around the platform.
*   Provide a marketplace for themes and plugins.

Business Goals:

*   Increase user adoption and market share.
*   Maintain a high level of user satisfaction.
*   Ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform.
*   Monetize the platform through the marketplace and potentially premium features.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities that could lead to website compromise and data breaches.
*   Competition from other CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Drupal, Joomla).
*   Lack of adoption or engagement from the developer community.
*   Performance issues or scalability limitations that hinder user experience.
*   Inability to keep up with evolving web technologies and security threats.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents or poor user experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Laravel Framework Security Features: OctoberCMS inherits the security features of the underlying Laravel framework, which include protection against common web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection. (Described in Laravel documentation)
*   security control: Input Validation: OctoberCMS and Laravel utilize input validation to sanitize user input and prevent malicious data from being processed. (Described in OctoberCMS and Laravel documentation)
*   security control: Authentication and Authorization: OctoberCMS provides a built-in authentication system for managing user accounts and permissions. (Described in OctoberCMS documentation)
*   security control: Templating Engine Security: The Twig templating engine used by OctoberCMS includes features to prevent XSS vulnerabilities by automatically escaping output. (Described in Twig documentation)
*   security control: File Upload Handling: OctoberCMS includes mechanisms for securely handling file uploads, including restricting file types and sizes. (Described in OctoberCMS documentation)
*   security control: Regular Updates: The OctoberCMS team and the Laravel community regularly release updates to address security vulnerabilities and improve the platform's security. (Described in OctoberCMS and Laravel release notes)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Plugins and Themes: The security of an OctoberCMS website can be affected by the quality and security of third-party plugins and themes. Users are responsible for vetting and updating these components.
*   accepted risk: Server Configuration: The security of the underlying server environment (e.g., operating system, web server, database) is outside the direct control of OctoberCMS.
*   accepted risk: User Account Security: The security of individual user accounts depends on users choosing strong passwords and practicing good security hygiene.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.
*   Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce secure connections.
*   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
*   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.
*   Implement a robust logging and monitoring system to detect and respond to security incidents.
*   Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for administrator accounts.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users must be authenticated before accessing administrative interfaces or sensitive data.
    *   Support for strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks (e.g., account lockout).
    *   Option for two-factor authentication (2FA).

*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific features and content based on user roles.
    *   Granular permissions to control access at a fine-grained level.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    *   Validation rules should be enforced on both the client-side and server-side.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) must be stored securely using strong encryption algorithms.
    *   HTTPS must be enforced for all communication between the client and the server.
    *   Use of cryptographically secure random number generators where appropriate.

## BUILD

The OctoberCMS build process involves several steps, from development to the creation of installation packages.  While the core OctoberCMS repository doesn't use a CI environment like GitHub Actions directly for building release packages (based on the provided repository link), a typical build process for OctoberCMS and its plugins/themes would involve the following:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer(("Developer")) --> GitRepository[("Git Repository (GitHub)")]
    GitRepository --> CI[("CI Server (GitHub Actions/Jenkins/etc.)")]
    CI --> Composer[("Composer (Dependency Management)")]
    CI --> Node[("Node.js/npm (Asset Compilation)")]
    CI --> SAST[("SAST Tools")]
    CI --> Linter[("Linters (PHP_CodeSniffer/ESLint)")]
    Composer --> Dependencies(("PHP Dependencies"))
    Node --> CompiledAssets(("Compiled Assets (CSS/JS)"))
    SAST --> SecurityReport(("Security Report"))
    Linter --> LintingReport(("Linting Report"))
    CI --> Artifacts(("Build Artifacts (Installation Package)"))

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: A developer writes code for OctoberCMS, a plugin, or a theme.
2.  Git Repository: The code is committed and pushed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
3.  CI Server: A continuous integration (CI) server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by the push event.
4.  Composer: Composer is used to manage PHP dependencies and install required libraries.
5.  Node.js/npm: Node.js and npm are used to compile assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) using tools like Webpack or Laravel Mix.
6.  SAST Tools: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., PHPStan, Psalm) are run to analyze the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
7.  Linters: Linters (e.g., PHP_CodeSniffer, ESLint) are used to enforce coding standards and identify potential code quality issues.
8.  Build Artifacts: The CI server creates build artifacts, which typically include an installation package (e.g., a ZIP file) containing the OctoberCMS core, plugins, or themes.

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   Dependency Management: Composer helps manage dependencies and ensures that known vulnerable versions of libraries are not used. Tools like Dependabot (on GitHub) can automatically create pull requests to update dependencies.
*   Asset Compilation: Secure asset compilation practices prevent vulnerabilities like XSS in compiled CSS and JavaScript.
*   SAST: SAST tools help identify security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
*   Linters: Linters enforce coding standards that can help prevent security issues.
*   Code Review: Code reviews (e.g., through pull requests) provide an opportunity for manual security checks.
*   Signed Packages: Release packages can be digitally signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Content Management: The ability for users to create, edit, and publish content is the core function of OctoberCMS.
