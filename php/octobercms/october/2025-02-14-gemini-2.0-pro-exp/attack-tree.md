## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_plugintheme_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.1 Known Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugin/Theme [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages a publicly known vulnerability in an installed plugin or theme to compromise the system. This is a high-risk path because exploits are often readily available, and the sheer number of plugins/themes increases the attack surface.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** Variable (often High), can lead to RCE, data breaches, website defacement.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (exploits are often publicly available).
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (if exploits are readily available), Advanced (if vulnerability discovery is required).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable through vulnerability scanning and intrusion detection systems).
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Identify installed plugins and themes.
        2.  Search for known vulnerabilities in those plugins/themes using vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, WPScan Database, Exploit-DB).
        3.  If a known vulnerability exists and an exploit is available, deploy the exploit.
        4.  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to:
            *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
            *   File Upload leading to RCE
            *   SQL Injection
            *   Authentication Bypass
            *   Data Exfiltration
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regularly update all plugins and themes to the latest versions.
        *   Only install plugins and themes from trusted sources.
        *   Minimize the number of installed plugins and themes. Remove unused ones.
        *   Conduct vulnerability scans of installed plugins and themes.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help block known exploit attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Weak Configuration/Deployment](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_weak_configurationdeployment.md)

*   **3.1 Predictable Admin URL / Default Credentials [CN][HR]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains administrative access by using default credentials (e.g., "admin/admin") or by guessing a predictable admin URL (e.g., `/backend`, `/admin`). This is a critical node and a high-risk path due to its simplicity and high success rate if basic security practices are ignored.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if default settings are not changed), Very Low (if best practices are followed).
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise).
    *   **Effort:** Very Low.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (easily detectable through automated scans and brute-force attempts).
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attempt to access common backend URLs (e.g., `/backend`, `/admin`, `/administrator`).
        2.  If a login page is found, try default credentials (e.g., "admin/admin", "admin/password", "user/password").
        3.  If successful, the attacker gains full administrative access.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Change default credentials immediately after installation.** This is the most crucial step.
        *   Rename the default backend URL to something less predictable.
        *   Implement strong password policies.
        *   Consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
        *   Implement IP whitelisting to restrict access to the backend from specific IP addresses.
        *   Monitor login attempts and block IP addresses with excessive failed login attempts.

*   **3.2 Weak File Permissions [HR]:**
     *   **Description:** Files and directories within the October CMS installation have overly permissive permissions. While not a direct path to *full* administrative access on its own, it's a *critical enabler* for many other attacks.  It allows unauthorized access or modification of files, which can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.
     *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common misconfiguration).
     *   **Impact:** Low to High (depending on which files/directories are affected).  Can enable other attacks, leading to RCE or data breaches.
     *   **Effort:** Low.
     *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
     *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (detectable through file system analysis).
     *   **Attack Steps:**
         1.  Gain some level of access to the server (e.g., through a file upload vulnerability, a compromised plugin, or even a low-privileged user account).
         2.  Exploit weak file permissions to:
             *   Modify configuration files (e.g., to inject malicious code or change settings).
             *   Overwrite critical system files.
             *   Read sensitive data (e.g., database credentials).
             *   Upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) to executable directories.
         3.  Use the modified files or gained information to escalate privileges or further compromise the system.
     *   **Mitigation:**
         *   Set correct file permissions:
             *   Directories: Generally `755` (owner: read/write/execute, group: read/execute, others: read/execute).
             *   Files: Generally `644` (owner: read/write, group: read, others: read).
             *   Configuration files (e.g., `config/database.php`): Should be even more restrictive, often `600` or `400` (owner: read/write or read-only, no access for group or others).
         *   Ensure the web server user (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`, `nginx`) has the *minimum necessary* permissions.
         *   Regularly audit file permissions to detect and correct any misconfigurations.
         *   Use a security-hardened server configuration.
