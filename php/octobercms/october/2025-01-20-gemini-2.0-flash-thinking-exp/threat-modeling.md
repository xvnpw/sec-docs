# Threat Model Analysis for octobercms/october

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in October CMS Core](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_october_cms_core.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability where the October CMS core deserializes untrusted data without proper validation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker can craft a malicious serialized object.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, potentially leading to full server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The October CMS core framework utilizing deserialization functions (e.g., `unserialize()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible within the October CMS core.
    *   If deserialization is necessary, implement robust validation and sanitization of the data before deserialization within the core.
    *   Keep the October CMS core updated, as security patches often address deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Core Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in October CMS's core authentication mechanism, allowing them to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access to the backend or user accounts.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, access to sensitive data, ability to modify content, and potential for further malicious activities.
*   **Affected Component:** The October CMS core authentication module.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the October CMS core updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts.
    *   Regularly review user accounts and permissions.
    *   Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Core Functionality](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__in_core_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on the website. This is typically done by embedding malicious code or links in emails or on other websites that, when clicked by an authenticated user, send requests to the target October CMS application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized changes to user accounts, data manipulation, or execution of administrative actions without the user's knowledge.
*   **Affected Component:** October CMS core functionalities that perform actions based on user requests (e.g., form submissions, administrative actions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium  *(Note: While generally Medium, the impact can be High depending on the targeted functionality)*
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure all forms and sensitive actions in October CMS utilize CSRF protection tokens.
    *   Developers contributing to October CMS should use the framework's built-in CSRF protection mechanisms.
    *   Educate users about the risks of clicking suspicious links.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling in the Media Manager](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling_in_the_media_manager.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script) through the October CMS media manager due to insufficient validation. This malicious file can then be accessed and executed, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to compromise the server.
*   **Affected Component:** The October CMS media manager.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation based on file content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension within the October CMS core.
    *   Rename uploaded files within the media manager to prevent direct execution.
    *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot if possible by default or through configuration.
    *   Implement file size limits in the media manager.
    *   Consider integrating malware scanning for uploaded files within the core functionality.
