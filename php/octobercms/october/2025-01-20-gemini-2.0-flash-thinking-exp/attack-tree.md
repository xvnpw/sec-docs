## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise October CMS Application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_october_cms_application__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal and represents any successful compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in October CMS Core (CRITICAL NODE, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_october_cms_core__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Unpatched Security Flaws (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers identify known vulnerabilities in specific versions of October CMS that haven't been patched.
    * The target application is running a vulnerable version.
* **Exploit Logic Flaws in Core Functionality (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers discover and exploit flaws in the core logic of October CMS.
    * **Bypass Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Exploiting weaknesses in how October CMS authenticates backend users or authorizes access to resources, potentially gaining administrative access.
    * **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE, High-Risk Path):**
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could involve deserialization flaws or other critical vulnerabilities in the core.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Plugins and Themes (CRITICAL NODE, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_plugins_and_themes__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Popular/Widely Used Plugins (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers target known vulnerabilities in popular third-party plugins used by the application.
    * The application has the vulnerable plugin installed.
* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Developed Plugins/Themes (High-Risk Path):**
    * **Exploit Insecure Coding Practices (High-Risk Path):**
        * Attackers exploit common coding errors in custom plugins or themes, such as lack of input sanitization, leading to vulnerabilities like SQL injection (though focusing on October specifics, this is common in custom code) or remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Access Sensitive Configuration Files (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers gain access to sensitive configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config/`) containing database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.
    * This is often achieved through misconfigured web servers or insecure file permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File System Access Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_system_access_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Upload Malicious Files (High-Risk Path):**
    * Attackers exploit weaknesses in the media manager or plugin upload functionalities to upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts).
    * These uploaded files can then be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution or other malicious activities.
