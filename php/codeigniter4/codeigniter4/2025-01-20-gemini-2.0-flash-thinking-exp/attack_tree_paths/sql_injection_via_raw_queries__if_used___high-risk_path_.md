### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SQL Injection via Raw Queries (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

#### 4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability

**Description:**

SQL Injection via Raw Queries occurs when an application directly incorporates unsanitized user-provided data into SQL queries that are then executed against the database. If an attacker can manipulate this user input, they can inject malicious SQL code that will be interpreted and executed by the database server. This allows attackers to bypass the intended logic of the application and interact directly with the database.

**Why Raw Queries are Vulnerable:**

Raw queries, by their nature, require the developer to manually handle the construction of the SQL string. This manual process is prone to errors, especially when dealing with dynamic data from user input. If the developer fails to properly sanitize or escape this input, it becomes a direct pathway for attackers to inject malicious SQL.

**CodeIgniter 4 Context:**

CodeIgniter 4 provides a robust Query Builder class that is designed to prevent SQL injection by automatically escaping values. However, developers might still choose to use raw queries for various reasons, such as:

* **Perceived performance benefits:**  In some niche scenarios, developers might believe raw queries offer better performance (though this is often negligible and comes with significant security risks).
* **Complexity of the query:**  For very complex or highly specific queries, developers might find it easier to write the SQL directly.
* **Legacy code or lack of awareness:**  Developers might be unaware of the security risks or be working with older code that uses raw queries.

#### 4.2 Example Scenario and Attack Vector

**Scenario:**

Consider a search functionality in a CodeIgniter 4 application where users can search for products by name. Instead of using the Query Builder, the developer uses a raw query:

```php
// Vulnerable code example (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
$searchTerm = $this->request->getGet('search');
$db = \Config\Database::connect();
$query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%" . $searchTerm . "%'");
$results = $query->getResultArray();
```

**Attack Vector:**

An attacker could craft a malicious `searchTerm` value to inject SQL code. For example, if the attacker provides the following input:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

The resulting SQL query would become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%%' OR 1=1 --%'
```

**Explanation of the Attack:**

* **`' OR 1=1`**: This injects a condition that is always true (`1=1`). Combined with the `OR` operator, this effectively bypasses the intended search criteria and will return all rows from the `products` table.
* **`--`**: This is an SQL comment. It comments out the remaining part of the original query (the closing `%`), preventing a syntax error.

**Impact of this Attack:**

In this simple example, the attacker can retrieve all product information. However, more sophisticated attacks can lead to:

* **Data Breach:**  Retrieving sensitive data like user credentials, financial information, or personal details.
* **Data Modification:**  Updating or deleting records in the database.
* **Account Takeover:**  Manipulating user accounts or granting themselves administrative privileges.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Executing resource-intensive queries that overload the database server.
* **Remote Code Execution (in extreme cases):**  Depending on the database server configuration and permissions, attackers might be able to execute operating system commands.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SQL Injection via Raw Queries attack can be severe, especially given its classification as a **HIGH-RISK PATH**. The potential consequences include:

* **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
* **Integrity Violation:**  Modification or deletion of critical data, leading to data corruption or loss.
* **Availability Disruption:**  Causing database errors or server overload, leading to application downtime.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and negative publicity due to security breaches.
* **Financial Losses:**  Costs associated with data recovery, legal fees, and regulatory fines.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to meet data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies

The most effective way to mitigate SQL Injection via Raw Queries is to **avoid using raw queries altogether** and leverage CodeIgniter 4's built-in security features.

**Recommended Practices:**

1. **Utilize CodeIgniter 4's Query Builder:** The Query Builder automatically escapes values, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities. It provides a safe and convenient way to construct database queries.

   ```php
   // Secure code example using Query Builder
   $searchTerm = $this->request->getGet('search');
   $db = \Config\Database::connect();
   $builder = $db->table('products');
   $builder->like('name', $searchTerm);
   $query = $builder->get();
   $results = $query->getResultArray();
   ```

2. **Prepared Statements with Parameter Binding:** If raw queries are absolutely necessary (which should be a rare occurrence), use prepared statements with parameter binding. This separates the SQL structure from the data, preventing malicious code injection.

   ```php
   // Safer raw query example using prepared statements
   $searchTerm = $this->request->getGet('search');
   $db = \Config\Database::connect();
   $sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE ?";
   $query = $db->prepare($sql);
   $query->execute(['%' . $searchTerm . '%']);
   $results = $query->getResultArray();
   ```

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a primary defense against SQL injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help prevent other types of attacks and reduce the attack surface. However, **never rely solely on input validation for SQL injection prevention.**

4. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject SQL.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including the use of raw queries.

6. **Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers about SQL injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.

#### 4.5 Detection and Prevention in CodeIgniter 4

CodeIgniter 4 provides several features that aid in the detection and prevention of SQL injection:

* **Query Builder's Automatic Escaping:** The primary defense mechanism.
* **`$db->escape()` method:**  Can be used to manually escape strings for use in raw queries (though prepared statements are preferred).
* **Configuration Options:** CodeIgniter 4 allows you to configure database connection settings, including the use of PDO and its prepared statement capabilities.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Static Code Analysis Tools:** Tools like SonarQube or PHPStan can be configured to detect the use of raw queries and flag them as potential security risks.
* **Manual Code Reviews:**  Careful examination of the codebase can identify instances where raw queries are being used.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Simulating real-world attacks can help identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other methods.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "SQL Injection via Raw Queries" attack path represents a significant security risk for CodeIgniter 4 applications. While CodeIgniter 4 provides robust tools like the Query Builder to prevent this vulnerability, the use of raw queries without proper sanitization opens the door to potentially devastating attacks.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Strictly Adhere to Using the Query Builder:**  Make the Query Builder the standard approach for all database interactions.
* **Eliminate Existing Raw Queries:**  Conduct a thorough review of the codebase and refactor any existing raw queries to use the Query Builder or prepared statements with parameter binding.
* **Implement Code Review Processes:**  Ensure that all database-related code is reviewed by another developer to catch potential security flaws.
* **Provide Security Training:**  Educate the development team on the risks of SQL injection and best practices for secure database interaction.
* **Utilize Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate static analysis tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
* **Regularly Perform Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to conduct penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.
