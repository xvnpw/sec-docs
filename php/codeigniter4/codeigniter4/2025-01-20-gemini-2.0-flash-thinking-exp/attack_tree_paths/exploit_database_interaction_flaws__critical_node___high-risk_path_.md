#### 4.1. Attack Vector: SQL Injection via Raw Queries (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:**

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that exploits security vulnerabilities in the database layer of an application. It occurs when user-supplied input is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping. When raw database queries are used, the developer is directly responsible for constructing the SQL string, making it highly susceptible to SQL injection if user input is directly concatenated into the query.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

When an application uses raw queries and directly embeds user input, an attacker can manipulate this input to inject malicious SQL code. The database server then interprets this injected code as part of the intended query, leading to unintended actions.

For example, consider a scenario where a user searches for products using a keyword. If the application uses a raw query like this:

```php
$keyword = $_GET['keyword'];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%" . $keyword . "%'";
$results = $db->query($sql);
```

An attacker could provide the following input for `keyword`:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

This would result in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%%' OR 1=1 --%'
```

The `OR 1=1` condition will always be true, effectively bypassing the intended search logic and potentially returning all records from the `products` table. The `--` comments out the rest of the query, preventing errors.

More sophisticated attacks can involve:

* **Data Exfiltration:** Extracting sensitive data from the database.
* **Data Modification:**  Inserting, updating, or deleting data.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to higher-level database privileges.
* **Remote Code Execution (in some database configurations):**  Executing arbitrary commands on the database server.

**CodeIgniter 4 Context:**

CodeIgniter 4 provides robust mechanisms to prevent SQL injection through its **Query Builder** and **Prepared Statements**. The Query Builder automatically escapes values, and prepared statements separate the SQL structure from the data, preventing malicious code injection.

However, CodeIgniter 4 also allows developers to execute **raw queries** using the `$db->query()` method. While this offers flexibility for complex queries, it also places the responsibility of preventing SQL injection squarely on the developer. If raw queries are used and user input is not properly handled, the application becomes vulnerable.

**Example:**

Consider a controller function in CodeIgniter 4 that uses a raw query to search for users:

```php
public function search()
{
    $keyword = $this->request->getGet('keyword');
    $db = \Config\Database::connect();
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%" . $keyword . "%'";
    $query = $db->query($sql);
    $results = $query->getResultArray();
    // ... process results
}
```

If an attacker provides the input `' OR 1=1 --` for the `keyword`, the resulting query will be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%%' OR 1=1 --%'
```

This will likely return all users from the `users` table, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact Assessment:**

A successful SQL injection attack via raw queries can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach (Confidentiality):**  Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary business data. This can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
* **Data Manipulation (Integrity):** Attackers can modify or delete critical data, leading to data corruption, loss of business continuity, and inaccurate information.
* **Denial of Service (Availability):**  Attackers might be able to execute queries that overload the database server, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
* **Account Takeover:** By manipulating queries related to authentication, attackers can bypass login mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
* **Administrative Control:** In severe cases, attackers might gain administrative access to the database server, allowing them to perform any action, including dropping tables or executing operating system commands.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

The primary strategy to mitigate SQL injection via raw queries is to **avoid using raw queries whenever possible**. CodeIgniter 4 provides excellent alternatives:

* **Use the Query Builder:** CodeIgniter 4's Query Builder provides a safe and convenient way to construct database queries. It automatically escapes values, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

   ```php
   $keyword = $this->request->getGet('keyword');
   $db = \Config\Database::connect();
   $results = $db->table('users')
                ->like('username', $keyword)
                ->get()
                ->getResultArray();
   ```

* **Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):**  Prepared statements separate the SQL structure from the data. Placeholders are used for data values, which are then passed separately to the database. This ensures that the data is treated as data and not executable code.

   ```php
   $keyword = $this->request->getGet('keyword');
   $db = \Config\Database::connect();
   $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE ?";
   $query = $db->prepare($sql);
   $query->execute(['%' . $keyword . '%']);
   $results = $query->getResultArray();
   ```

If using raw queries is absolutely necessary for complex scenarios, the following precautions **must** be taken:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into SQL queries. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Only allow specific, expected characters or patterns.
    * **Escaping:**  Use database-specific escaping functions (though this is less reliable than prepared statements). CodeIgniter 4 provides `$db->escape()` for this purpose, but it's generally recommended to avoid raw queries altogether.
    * **Type Casting:** Ensure that input values are of the expected data type.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks. Avoid using database accounts with administrative privileges.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.

**Example of Secure Implementation using Query Builder:**

```php
public function search()
{
    $keyword = $this->request->getGet('keyword');
    $db = \Config\Database::connect();
    $results = $db->table('users')
                ->like('username', $keyword)
                ->get()
                ->getResultArray();
    // ... process results
}
```

In this example, the Query Builder handles the escaping of the `$keyword` automatically, preventing SQL injection.

**Example of Secure Implementation using Prepared Statements:**

```php
public function search()
{
    $keyword = $this->request->getGet('keyword');
    $db = \Config\Database::connect();
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE ?";
    $query = $db->prepare($sql);
    $query->execute(['%' . $keyword . '%']);
    $results = $query->getResultArray();
    // ... process results
}
```

Here, the placeholder `?` is used in the SQL query, and the actual value is passed separately during execution, preventing the interpretation of malicious code.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Exploit Database Interaction Flaws" path, specifically through "SQL Injection via Raw Queries," represents a significant security risk in CodeIgniter 4 applications. While the framework provides robust tools like the Query Builder and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, the use of raw queries bypasses these safeguards and places the burden of security entirely on the developer.

It is **strongly recommended** that the development team prioritize the use of CodeIgniter 4's built-in security features for database interactions and avoid raw queries unless absolutely necessary. When raw queries are unavoidable, extreme caution must be exercised to implement proper input validation, sanitization, and escaping techniques. Regular security audits and penetration testing are crucial to identify and address potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. By adhering to secure coding practices and leveraging the framework's security features, the risk of successful SQL injection attacks can be significantly reduced.
