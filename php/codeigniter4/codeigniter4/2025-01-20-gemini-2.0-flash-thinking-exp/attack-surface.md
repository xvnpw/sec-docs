# Attack Surface Analysis for codeigniter4/codeigniter4

## Attack Surface: [Route Injection](./attack_surfaces/route_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers manipulate the application's routing mechanism to access unintended controllers or methods, bypassing intended access controls.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** Overly permissive or poorly defined routes in `app/Config/Routes.php` can allow attackers to craft URLs that map to sensitive or administrative functions. Reliance on auto-routing without careful consideration can also expose more endpoints than intended.

**Example:** An application has a route `/admin/deleteUser/{id}`. If a similar, unintended route like `/admin/anyFunction/{param}` exists due to loose routing rules, an attacker might access it with `/admin/anyFunction/someMaliciousAction`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application functionality, potential data manipulation, or execution of arbitrary code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define explicit and restrictive routes in `app/Config/Routes.php`.
*   Avoid overly broad wildcard routes.
*   Carefully review and understand the implications of using auto-routing.
*   Implement proper authentication and authorization checks within controllers to verify user permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_route_parameters.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into route parameters, which is then processed by the application without proper sanitization or validation.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** If developers directly use route parameters (accessed via `$this->request->getVar()`, `$this->request->getGet()`, etc.) in database queries or other sensitive operations without validation, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A route `/user/profile/{id}`. An attacker could send a request to `/user/profile/' OR '1'='1` if the `id` parameter is directly used in a raw SQL query without sanitization, potentially leading to SQL injection.

**Impact:** SQL injection, command injection, path traversal, or other injection vulnerabilities depending on how the parameter is used.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always validate and sanitize route parameters before using them.
*   Use CodeIgniter's input validation library.
*   Utilize prepared statements or CodeIgniter's query builder to prevent SQL injection.
*   Avoid directly using route parameters in system commands or file paths without thorough validation.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_template_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** If data passed to views is not properly escaped using CodeIgniter's escaping functions, attackers can inject JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Example:** A controller passes user-provided data `$name` to a view. If the view directly outputs `<h1>Hello, <?=$name?></h1>` without escaping, and `$name` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the script will execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always escape output in views using CodeIgniter's `esc()` function with the appropriate context (e.g., `esc($name)`, `esc($description, 'html')`).
*   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection (if raw queries are used or query builder is misused)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection__if_raw_queries_are_used_or_query_builder_is_misused_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into database queries, allowing them to manipulate or extract data.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** While CodeIgniter's query builder provides protection against SQL injection, developers using raw queries or improperly constructing query builder statements can still introduce this vulnerability.

**Example:**  Using a raw query like `$db->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $this->request->getVar('username') . "'");` without proper escaping makes the application vulnerable if the `username` input contains malicious SQL.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use CodeIgniter's query builder with parameterized queries.**
*   If raw queries are absolutely necessary, use `$db->escape()` or prepared statements with bound parameters.
*   Enforce the principle of least privilege for database user accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Attackers trick users into performing unintended actions on a web application in which they are authenticated.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** If CSRF protection is not enabled or is improperly configured in `app/Config/App.php`, the application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious website with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable application to change the user's password. If the user is logged in and visits the attacker's site, the password change request will be executed without their knowledge.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or transferring funds.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable CSRF protection in `app/Config/App.php` by setting `$CSRFProtect = true;`.**
*   Use CodeIgniter's form helper or form builder, which automatically includes CSRF tokens.
*   For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers or data.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** Attackers upload malicious files to the server, which can then be executed or used for other malicious purposes.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** If file upload functionality is implemented without proper validation of file types, sizes, and content, attackers can upload executable files (e.g., PHP scripts).

**Example:** An application allows users to upload profile pictures without proper validation. An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image, which can then be accessed and executed, potentially granting them control over the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, defacement, data theft.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the extension.**
*   Limit file sizes.
*   Rename uploaded files to prevent execution.
*   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a dedicated storage service.
*   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.
