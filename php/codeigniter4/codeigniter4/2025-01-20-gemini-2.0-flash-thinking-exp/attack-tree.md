## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application (CI4 Specific) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application__ci4_specific___critical_node_.md)

* **Compromise Application (CI4 Specific) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the root goal, representing the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success at any of the child nodes can lead to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Route Misconfiguration
        * **Description:** Incorrectly defined routes, especially wildcard routes or route groups, can allow attackers to access unintended controller methods or bypass authorization checks.
        * **Example:** A wildcard route unintentionally mapping to a sensitive administrative function.
    * **Attack Vector:** Insecure Route Handling
        * **Description:** Relying solely on route parameters for critical logic without proper validation and authorization within the controller can be exploited by manipulating the URL.
        * **Example:** An application deleting a user based solely on an ID passed in the route without verifying user permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Input Handling Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Bypassing Input Validation
        * **Description:** Insufficient or improperly implemented server-side validation allows attackers to submit malicious input that can lead to various vulnerabilities.
        * **Example:** Submitting SQL injection payloads through form fields that are not properly sanitized.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using `unserialize` on user input) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_using__unserialize__on_user_input___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if using `unserialize` on user input) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Deserializing untrusted user input can lead to remote code execution if the application uses vulnerable classes with magic methods.
        * **Example:** An attacker crafting a malicious serialized object that, when unserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Interaction Flaws [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_interaction_flaws__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Database Interaction Flaws [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** SQL Injection via Raw Queries (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * **Description:** Constructing database queries using unsanitized user input allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
        * **Example:** An attacker manipulating a search query to extract all user credentials from the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Raw Queries (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_raw_queries__if_used___high-risk_path_.md)

* **SQL Injection via Raw Queries (if used) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Constructing database queries using unsanitized user input allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
        * **Example:** An attacker manipulating a search query to extract all user credentials from the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Templating Engine Issues [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_templating_engine_issues__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit Templating Engine Issues [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Output [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * **Description:** Displaying user-provided data in views without proper output escaping allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in other users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or information theft.
        * **Example:** An attacker injecting JavaScript code into a comment field that, when viewed by other users, steals their session cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Output [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unescaped_output__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Output [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Displaying user-provided data in views without proper output escaping allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in other users' browsers, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or information theft.
        * **Example:** An attacker injecting JavaScript code into a comment field that, when viewed by other users, steals their session cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit File Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Unrestricted File Upload [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * **Description:** Allowing users to upload files without proper validation of file type, size, and content can enable attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) that can be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution or other compromises.
        * **Example:** An attacker uploading a PHP backdoor script that allows them to remotely control the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unrestricted File Upload [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/unrestricted_file_upload__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Unrestricted File Upload [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Allowing users to upload files without proper validation of file type, size, and content can enable attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) that can be executed on the server, leading to remote code execution or other compromises.
        * **Example:** An attacker uploading a PHP backdoor script that allows them to remotely control the server.
