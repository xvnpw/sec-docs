# Threat Model Analysis for codeigniter4/codeigniter4

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via User-Controlled Data in Templates](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_user-controlled_data_in_templates.md)

**Description:** If developers explicitly disable escaping or use features that allow raw output of user-controlled data within CodeIgniter 4's template directives (e.g., directly echoing unescaped variables), an attacker could inject malicious code that gets executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach.

**Affected Component:** `CodeIgniter\View\View` (the templating engine and its rendering process).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure auto-escaping is enabled in your templating engine configuration.
* Avoid directly outputting user-supplied data without proper escaping. Use the framework's escaping functions (e.g., `esc()`).
* Be extremely cautious when using template features that allow raw output or code execution.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization via Session Handling](./threats/insecure_deserialization_via_session_handling.md)

**Description:** If CodeIgniter 4's session handler is configured to use a format like `php` and the `session_serialize_handler` PHP ini directive is set to `php` (the default), and if an attacker can control the session data, they could inject malicious serialized objects. When CodeIgniter 4 unserializes this data, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise.

**Affected Component:** `CodeIgniter\Session\Session` (the session management component).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use a safer session serialization handler like `json` by setting the `sessionDriver` configuration option to a database or other secure storage.
* Implement strong session security measures to prevent session fixation and hijacking.
* Regularly regenerate session IDs.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Improper Use of Query Builder with Raw Queries](./threats/sql_injection_via_improper_use_of_query_builder_with_raw_queries.md)

**Description:** While CodeIgniter 4's Query Builder provides protection, developers might introduce vulnerabilities if they use raw SQL fragments within Query Builder methods (e.g., `where()`, `having()`) without proper escaping of user-provided data.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for remote command execution depending on database permissions.

**Affected Component:** `CodeIgniter\Database\BaseBuilder` (the Query Builder component).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use Query Builder's binding features (e.g., `?` placeholders and passing an array of values) when incorporating user input into queries.
* Avoid using raw SQL fragments with user input whenever possible. If necessary, ensure thorough sanitization and escaping.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection Bypass due to Misconfiguration](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__protection_bypass_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** If CodeIgniter 4's built-in CSRF protection is disabled, not properly implemented in forms, or if custom AJAX requests are not correctly handling CSRF tokens, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into making unintended requests on the application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a user, data modification, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** `CodeIgniter\Security\Security` (the CSRF protection mechanism), `CodeIgniter\HTTP\Request` (handling of CSRF tokens).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in the application configuration.
* Use the `csrf_field()` helper function in your forms to include the CSRF token.
* For AJAX requests, include the CSRF token in the request headers or data.
* Consider using the `CSRFVerify` filter for routes that require CSRF protection.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling.md)

**Description:** If CodeIgniter 4's file upload handling is not implemented securely, attackers could upload malicious files that could be executed on the server or used to compromise other users. This includes insufficient validation of file types, sizes, and content.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, malware distribution.

**Affected Component:** `CodeIgniter\HTTP\Files\UploadedFile` (handling uploaded files).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just extensions.
* Limit file sizes.
* Rename uploaded files to prevent execution.
* Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions.
* Scan uploaded files for malware.
