# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for codeigniter4/codeigniter4

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize CodeIgniter4's Query Builder and ORM](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_codeigniter4's_query_builder_and_orm.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **For all database interactions, prioritize using CodeIgniter4's Query Builder or ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).** These tools are designed with built-in protection against SQL injection by automatically escaping values.
    2.  **Avoid writing raw SQL queries directly** unless absolutely necessary for complex or framework-unsupported operations.
    3.  **When using Query Builder or ORM, always pass user inputs as parameters** to the methods (e.g., `where()`, `like()`, `insert()`, `update()`) instead of concatenating them directly into the query string.
    4.  **Review existing codebase and refactor any raw SQL queries to use Query Builder or ORM equivalents.**
    5.  **Train developers on secure database interaction practices using Query Builder and ORM.**
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code to manipulate database queries, leveraging the framework's built-in escaping.
*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: High - Significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities by utilizing framework features.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, largely implemented in data retrieval and manipulation controllers. Models extensively use ORM.
    *   Implemented in: `App\Controllers` and `App\Models`
*   **Missing Implementation:** Minor instances of raw SQL queries exist in some legacy reporting modules and custom dashboard widgets.
    *   Missing in: `App\Controllers\Admin\ReportsController`, `App\Views\Admin\Dashboard\Widgets`

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Output Escaping with `esc()` Function](./mitigation_strategies/employ_output_escaping_with__esc____function.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **In all views (`.php` files in `app/Views`), consistently use the `esc()` function provided by CodeIgniter4 to escape output data before displaying it in HTML.**
    2.  **Choose the appropriate escaping context based on where the data is being output, using the context-aware options of `esc()`:**
        *   `esc('html', $variable)` for general HTML content.
        *   `esc('js', $variable)` for JavaScript context.
        *   `esc('css', $variable)` for CSS context.
        *   `esc('url', $variable)` for URLs.
    3.  **Review all views and identify instances where output escaping using `esc()` is missing or incorrectly used.**
    4.  **Implement output escaping for all dynamic data being displayed using the `esc()` function.**
    5.  **Establish code review processes to ensure output escaping with `esc()` is consistently applied in new code.**
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into web pages by leveraging CodeIgniter4's output escaping function.
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: High - Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities by utilizing the framework's escaping mechanism.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `esc()` is used in most newer views, but older views and some dynamically generated content are missing proper escaping.
    *   Implemented in: Most views under `App\Views\`, newer components.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Older views in `App\Views\Legacy\`, dynamically generated content in JavaScript within views, error messages displayed directly in views.
    *   Missing in: `App\Views\Legacy\`, JavaScript templates in views, error display logic in views.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Enforce CSRF Protection (CodeIgniter4 Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_enforce_csrf_protection__codeigniter4_feature_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable CSRF protection in `Config\App.php` by setting `$CSRFProtection` to either `'session'` or `'cookie'`.** This activates CodeIgniter4's built-in CSRF protection.
    2.  **Ensure the `CSRF` filter provided by CodeIgniter4 is applied globally or to relevant routes in `Config\Filters.php` and `Config\Routes.php`.** Apply it to routes handling POST, PUT, DELETE requests to utilize the framework's filter.
    3.  **Include `<?= csrf_field() ?>` in all HTML forms that submit data via POST, PUT, or DELETE methods.** This uses CodeIgniter4's helper function to automatically add the hidden CSRF token field.
    4.  **For AJAX requests that modify data, include the CSRF token in the request headers or data.** Retrieve the token using `csrf_token()` and header name using `csrf_header()` - CodeIgniter4 helper functions.
    5.  **Test CSRF protection by attempting to submit forms or AJAX requests without the CSRF token.** Verify that requests are blocked by CodeIgniter4's CSRF middleware.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity) - Prevents attackers from performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users, leveraging CodeIgniter4's CSRF protection mechanisms.
*   **Impact:**
    *   CSRF: High - Effectively mitigates CSRF attacks by using the framework's built-in protection.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, CSRF protection is enabled in `Config\App.php` and the filter is applied globally. `csrf_field()` is used in most forms.
    *   Implemented in: `Config\App.php`, `Config\Filters.php`, `Config\Routes.php`, most forms in `App\Views\`
*   **Missing Implementation:** CSRF token inclusion is missing in some AJAX forms and custom API endpoints that handle data modification.
    *   Missing in: AJAX forms in `App\Views\`, API endpoints in `App\Controllers\Api\`

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Session Settings (CodeIgniter4 Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_session_settings__codeigniter4_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review and configure session settings in `Config\Session.php`, CodeIgniter4's session configuration file.**
    2.  **Set `sessionDriver` to `'database'` or `'files'` (with secure file permissions) instead of the default `'files'` if file permissions are not properly managed.** Database driver is generally more secure in shared hosting environments and configurable within CodeIgniter4.
    3.  **Set `sessionCookieSecure` to `true` to ensure session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS, configurable in CodeIgniter4.**
    4.  **Set `sessionCookieHttpOnly` to `true` to prevent client-side JavaScript access to session cookies, configurable in CodeIgniter4.**
    5.  **Set `sessionCookieSameSite` to `'Lax'` or `'Strict'` to mitigate CSRF risks related to session cookies, configurable in CodeIgniter4.** `'Strict'` offers stronger protection but might impact usability in some scenarios.
    6.  **Consider setting a reasonable `sessionExpiration` value to limit session lifespan, configurable in CodeIgniter4.**
    7.  **Regularly regenerate session IDs after critical actions like login using `session()->regenerate()`, a CodeIgniter4 session method.**

    *   Session Hijacking (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from stealing and using valid session IDs to impersonate users by leveraging secure session configurations within CodeIgniter4.
    *   Session Fixation (Medium Severity) - Prevents attackers from pre-setting session IDs to hijack user sessions after login, mitigated by session regeneration in CodeIgniter4.
    *   CSRF (related to session cookies) (Medium Severity) - `SameSite` attribute helps mitigate CSRF, configurable within CodeIgniter4.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Session Hijacking: High - Significantly reduces the risk through secure framework session configuration.
    *   Session Fixation: High - Effectively mitigates using framework's session regeneration.
    *   CSRF (Session Cookies): Medium - Provides additional layer of defense through framework configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `sessionCookieSecure` and `sessionCookieHttpOnly` are enabled. `sessionDriver` is set to `'files'`. `sessionCookieSameSite` is default. Session regeneration is implemented after login.
    *   Implemented in: `Config\Session.php` (partially), `App\Controllers\Auth\LoginController` (session regeneration).
*   **Missing Implementation:** `sessionDriver` should be changed to `'database'` for better security. `sessionCookieSameSite` should be set to `'Lax'` or `'Strict'`. `sessionExpiration` should be configured.
    *   Missing in: `Config\Session.php` (driver, SameSite, expiration).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict File Upload Security (Utilizing CodeIgniter4's File Upload Library)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_file_upload_security__utilizing_codeigniter4's_file_upload_library_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use CodeIgniter4's File Upload library for handling file uploads.** This ensures consistent and secure file handling within the framework.
    2.  **Define strict validation rules in the File Upload library configuration:**
        *   **Restrict allowed file types using `setAllowedFileTypes()` based on MIME types and/or extensions, a feature of CodeIgniter4's library.**
        *   **Set maximum file size using `setMaxSize()` to prevent denial-of-service and storage exhaustion, a feature of CodeIgniter4's library.**
    3.  **Validate file types on the server-side using `isValid()` and `hasMoved()` methods of the UploadedFile class, provided by CodeIgniter4.**
    4.  **Sanitize uploaded filenames using `getRandomName()` or custom sanitization logic to prevent directory traversal and other filename-based attacks. `getRandomName()` is a utility in CodeIgniter4's library.**
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unrestricted File Upload (High Severity) - Allows attackers to upload malicious files by bypassing client-side checks, mitigated by using CodeIgniter4's server-side validation.
    *   Directory Traversal (Medium Severity) - Attackers might manipulate filenames to access or overwrite files outside the intended upload directory, prevented by filename sanitization using CodeIgniter4's utilities.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity) - Uploading excessively large files can exhaust server resources, prevented by size limits configurable in CodeIgniter4's library.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unrestricted File Upload: High - Significantly reduces the risk by using framework's validation and handling.
    *   Directory Traversal: High - Effectively mitigates through framework's filename sanitization.
