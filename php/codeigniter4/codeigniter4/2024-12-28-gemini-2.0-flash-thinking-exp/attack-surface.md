*   **Unvalidated User Input leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Description:**  Malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How CodeIgniter4 Contributes:**  Directly outputting user-provided data in views without using CodeIgniter4's escaping mechanisms (`esc()`) makes the application vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A comment form where the submitted comment is displayed directly without escaping. An attacker could submit a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which would execute in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use CodeIgniter4's `esc()` function when displaying user-provided data in views.
        *   Utilize specific escaping functions like `esc($data, 'html')`, `esc($data, 'js')`, `esc($data, 'css')`, etc., based on the context.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

*   **Unvalidated User Input leading to SQL Injection**
    *   **Description:**  Malicious SQL queries are injected into the application's database queries.
    *   **How CodeIgniter4 Contributes:**  Using raw database queries and directly concatenating user input without proper sanitization or using the Query Builder incorrectly can lead to SQL injection.
    *   **Example:**  A search functionality where the search term is directly inserted into a raw SQL query: `$db->query("SELECT * FROM items WHERE name LIKE '%".$_GET['search']."%'");`. An attacker could input `%' OR 1=1 --` to bypass the intended query.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Primarily use CodeIgniter4's Query Builder with bound parameters for database interactions. This automatically handles escaping.
        *   If raw queries are absolutely necessary, use `$db->escape()` or prepared statements with bound parameters.
        *   Implement input validation to restrict the types and formats of user input.
        *   Adopt a least privilege principle for database user accounts.

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker tricks a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the web application.
    *   **How CodeIgniter4 Contributes:**  While CodeIgniter4 provides CSRF protection, failing to enable it or incorrectly configuring it leaves the application vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker crafts a malicious link or form that, when clicked by a logged-in user, transfers funds from their account without their knowledge.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, data modification, financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable CodeIgniter4's CSRF protection by setting `$CSRFConfig['protection'] = 'session';` in `app/Config/App.php`.
        *   Use the `csrf_field()` helper function in forms to include the CSRF token.
        *   Ensure AJAX requests include the CSRF token in headers or request body.
        *   Consider using the `CSRF` filter for routes that require CSRF protection.

*   **Insecure File Uploads**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers upload malicious files that can be executed on the server or used for other attacks.
    *   **How CodeIgniter4 Contributes:**  Failing to properly validate file types, sizes, and names when handling file uploads using CodeIgniter4's file upload library can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image, which, if accessible and executed by the web server, could allow them to gain control of the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, server compromise, defacement, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) and not just extensions.
        *   Enforce strict file size limits.
        *   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal or other injection attacks.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions.
        *   Implement virus scanning on uploaded files.

*   **Session Fixation**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker forces a user to use a specific session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the session later.
    *   **How CodeIgniter4 Contributes:**  If the application doesn't regenerate the session ID after successful login, it's susceptible to session fixation.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker sends a user a link with a specific session ID. If the user logs in using that link, the attacker can then use that same session ID to access the user's account.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure CodeIgniter4 to regenerate the session ID after successful login by setting `$sessionConfig['regenerate'] = true;` in `app/Config/Session.php`.
        *   Use secure session cookies with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
        *   Consider using a more robust session storage mechanism than the default file-based storage.
