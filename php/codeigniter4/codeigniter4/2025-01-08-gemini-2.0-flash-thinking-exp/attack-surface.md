# Attack Surface Analysis for codeigniter4/codeigniter4

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Route Handlers Leading to Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_route_handlers_leading_to_mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Controller methods directly accepting user input to update model properties without explicitly defining allowed fields. This allows attackers to modify unintended database columns.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** CodeIgniter 4's model features, while convenient, can lead to mass assignment if developers don't use the `$allowedFields` property or manually filter input.

**Example:** A user sends a POST request to `/users/update/1` with data like `{"username": "attacker", "is_admin": true}`. If the `User` model doesn't have `$allowedFields` defined and the controller directly updates the model with `$this->model->update($id, $this->request->getPost())`, the `is_admin` column could be unintentionally updated.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Utilize the `$allowedFields` property in CodeIgniter 4 models:**  Explicitly define which fields are allowed to be mass-assigned.
*   **Use `only()` or `except()` methods on the request object:** Filter the input data before passing it to the model.
*   **Manually assign properties:**  Explicitly set each property of the model instead of using mass assignment.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Improper Query Builder Usage or Raw Queries](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_improper_query_builder_usage_or_raw_queries.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from directly embedding unsanitized user input into database queries, even when using CodeIgniter 4's query builder.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** While the query builder offers protection, developers might bypass it with raw queries (`$db->query()`) or by incorrectly using builder methods without proper escaping.

**Example:** A controller uses `$db->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $this->request->getGet('username') . "'")`. If the `username` parameter contains `' OR '1'='1`, it can lead to unauthorized data retrieval.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution (in some database configurations).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use parameterized queries or the query builder's escaping mechanisms:**  Avoid direct string concatenation of user input into SQL queries.
*   **Use query builder methods like `where()` with bound parameters:**  Let CodeIgniter 4 handle the escaping.
*   **Sanitize user input specifically for database interactions if absolutely necessary to use raw queries (discouraged).**

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to Improper Output Escaping in Views](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__due_to_improper_output_escaping_in_views.md)

**Description:**  Failing to properly escape user-provided data when rendering it in HTML views, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** While CodeIgniter 4 offers auto-escaping, developers might disable it or forget to escape in specific contexts (e.g., JavaScript, CSS).

**Example:** A view displays `<h1><?= $username ?></h1>` where `$username` is directly from user input. If `$username` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the script will execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Utilize CodeIgniter 4's auto-escaping feature:** Ensure it's enabled and understand its limitations.
*   **Use the `esc()` function for context-specific escaping:**  Escape data appropriately for HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or URL contexts.
*   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers:**  Further restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to Missing or Improper Token Handling](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__due_to_missing_or_improper_token_handling.md)

**Description:**  Attackers tricking authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** CodeIgniter 4 provides built-in CSRF protection, but developers must enable and correctly implement it in forms and AJAX requests.

**Example:** A user is logged into a banking application. An attacker sends them a link to a malicious site containing a form that submits a money transfer request to the banking application. Without proper CSRF protection, the user's browser might unknowingly execute this request.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data modification, financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable CSRF protection in CodeIgniter 4's configuration:**  Set `$CSRFProtect` to `true`.
*   **Use the `csrf_field()` helper in forms:**  This automatically generates the hidden CSRF token field.
*   **Include the CSRF token in AJAX requests:**  Send the token in headers or request body.
*   **Use the `CSRFVerify` filter on relevant routes:**  Ensure that requests are checked for valid CSRF tokens.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads Leading to Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads_leading_to_remote_code_execution_or_information_disclosure.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from insufficient validation and handling of uploaded files.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:** CodeIgniter 4 provides file upload handling, but developers are responsible for implementing proper security measures.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image. If the application doesn't properly validate the file content and stores it in a publicly accessible directory, the attacker can execute the script by accessing its URL.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Validate file types based on content, not just extensions:**  Use MIME type checking and file signature verification.
*   **Sanitize filenames:**  Remove potentially harmful characters.
*   **Store uploaded files outside the webroot:**  Prevent direct access via URL.
*   **Implement access controls:**  Restrict access to uploaded files based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Consider using a dedicated storage service:**  Offload file storage to a more secure platform.

## Attack Surface: [Session Hijacking and Fixation due to Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/session_hijacking_and_fixation_due_to_insecure_session_management.md)

**Description:**  Attackers stealing or manipulating user session IDs to gain unauthorized access.

**How CodeIgniter 4 Contributes:**  While CodeIgniter 4 provides session management, default configurations or improper usage can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts a user's session cookie over an unencrypted connection (HTTP) or through a cross-site scripting attack (session hijacking). In session fixation, the attacker sets a known session ID before the user logs in.

**Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use HTTPS for all application traffic:**  Encrypt session cookies.
*   **Set the `httponly` and `secure` flags on session cookies:**  Prevent JavaScript access and ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
*   **Regenerate session IDs after successful login:**  Prevent session fixation.
*   **Implement session timeouts:**  Limit the lifespan of sessions.
*   **Consider using a more secure session storage mechanism:**  Store sessions in a database or other secure storage.
