**Components:**

*   **User (Browser):** The entity initiating requests to the application through a web browser. This is the primary external interface and a common target for attacks.
*   **Web Server:**  Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, serving static content, and forwarding dynamic requests to the CI4 application. Security misconfigurations at this level can expose the application.
*   **CodeIgniter 4 Application:** The PHP application built using the CI4 framework. This is where the core application logic resides and is a central point for security considerations.
*   **Router:**  Analyzes the incoming request URI to determine the appropriate Controller and method to handle the request. Incorrect routing configurations or vulnerabilities in the routing logic can lead to unauthorized access.
*   **Controller:**  Receives the request, orchestrates the application logic, interacts with Models to manage data, and selects the View for rendering the response. Controllers are critical for input validation and authorization.
*   **Model:** Represents the data structures and business logic, providing an interface for interacting with data sources (typically the database). Models should implement data access controls and prevent direct SQL injection.
*   **View:**  Responsible for presenting data to the user, typically in HTML format. Views must be carefully crafted to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Database:**  The persistent storage for the application's data. Database security is paramount, including access controls, secure configurations, and protection against injection attacks.

The request lifecycle in CodeIgniter 4 involves several stages where security checks and potential vulnerabilities can arise.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant "'User'" as User
    participant "'Web Server'" as WS
    participant "'public/index.php'" as Index
    participant "'Router'" as Router
    participant "'Controller'" as Controller
    participant "'Model'" as Model
    participant "'Database'" as Database
    participant "'View'" as View

    User->>WS: "HTTP Request (Potential Injection Attacks)"
    WS->>Index: "Forward Request"
    Index->>Router: "Route Request (Vulnerable Routing Rules?)"
    Router->>Controller: "Determine Controller & Method"
    Controller->>Model: "Interact with Data (Unsafe Queries?)"
    Model->>Database: "Query Database (SQL Injection Risk)"
    Database-->>Model: "Data Response"
    Controller->>View: "Prepare Data for Rendering (Unescaped Data?)"
    View->>WS: "Rendered HTML (XSS Vulnerability?)"
    WS->>User: "HTTP Response"
```

**Detailed Data Flow with Security Considerations:**

1. **User Interaction:** The user sends an HTTP request. This is the first entry point for potential attacks like injection attempts in the request parameters or headers.
2. **Web Server Reception:** The web server receives the request. Web server misconfigurations can expose vulnerabilities before the application even processes the request.
3. **Front Controller:** The request is directed to `public/index.php`. Ensure this file is protected from unauthorized modifications.
4. **Bootstrapping:** `index.php` initializes the framework. Any vulnerabilities during this phase could compromise the entire application.
5. **Routing:** The Router matches the request URI to defined routes. Incorrectly configured routes or vulnerabilities in the routing logic can lead to unauthorized access.
6. **Controller Invocation:** The appropriate Controller is instantiated. This is a key area for authorization checks – ensuring the user has permission to access the requested resource.
7. **Model Interaction:** The Controller interacts with Models to fetch or manipulate data. Care must be taken to construct database queries securely to prevent SQL injection.
8. **Database Interaction:** Models interact with the database. This is a critical point for SQL injection vulnerabilities if parameterized queries are not used correctly.
9. **View Rendering:** The Controller passes data to the View. Data must be properly escaped before being rendered to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
10. **Response Generation:** The View generates the HTML response. Ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently included in the response.
11. **Web Server Response:** The web server sends the response to the user. Response headers can be manipulated for security purposes (e.g., setting security headers).
12. **User Response:** The user's browser receives the response. Client-side security measures can help mitigate some vulnerabilities.
