# Threat Model Analysis for codeigniter4/codeigniter4

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Exploitation Through Unprotected Entities](./threats/mass_assignment_exploitation_through_unprotected_entities.md)

*   **Description:** If CodeIgniter 4 entities are not properly configured with `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties, an attacker could send unexpected data in a request that directly maps to database columns, potentially modifying sensitive data without explicit authorization. The attacker crafts a request with extra fields corresponding to database columns.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of database records, potential privilege escalation or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Entity` class, `Model` class (when using `insert()` or `update()` with entity objects).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always define `$fillable` (allowed to be mass-assigned) or `$guarded` (not allowed to be mass-assigned) properties in your entities.
        *   Be explicit about which fields can be modified through mass assignment.
        *   Avoid directly passing user input to entity creation or update methods without proper filtering.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection via Unsafe Template Directives](./threats/server-side_template_injection_via_unsafe_template_directives.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into template variables if developers use template directives that evaluate arbitrary expressions (like `<?php ... ?>` if enabled or unsafe custom directives) and allow user-controlled data within those expressions. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `View` class, the templating engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using template directives that allow arbitrary code execution if possible.
        *   Sanitize user input thoroughly before displaying it in templates.
        *   Use a templating engine with built-in security features and auto-escaping enabled.
        *   Consider using a stricter templating syntax that limits code execution.

## Threat: [Insecure File Upload Handling Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/insecure_file_upload_handling_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If file uploads are not handled securely (e.g., insufficient validation of file types, no renaming of files, storing files in publicly accessible directories), an attacker could upload malicious executable files (like PHP scripts) and then access them directly through the web server to execute arbitrary code. This is directly related to how the `Request` class handles file uploads.
    *   **Impact:** Complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Request` class (handling file uploads), file system operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate file types based on content, not just the extension.
        *   Rename uploaded files to prevent direct execution.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in directories with restricted execution permissions.
        *   Implement proper access controls for uploaded files.
        *   Scan uploaded files for malware if feasible.

## Threat: [Session Fixation due to Insecure Session Management](./threats/session_fixation_due_to_insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trick a user into using a specific session ID that the attacker controls. This allows the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in. This can happen if session IDs are predictable or if the application doesn't regenerate the session ID after successful login, which are aspects of CodeIgniter 4's session library.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Session` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regenerate the session ID after successful login.
        *   Use secure session cookies (HttpOnly and Secure flags).
        *   Consider using a more robust session storage mechanism.
        *   Implement timeouts for inactive sessions.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection Bypass](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__protection_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** If CSRF protection, provided by CodeIgniter 4's `Security` helper, is not implemented correctly or if there are weaknesses in its implementation, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into making unintended requests on the application, potentially performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a legitimate user, data manipulation, or financial losses.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Security` helper (CSRF protection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure CSRF protection is enabled globally or for all relevant forms and AJAX requests.
        *   Use the `csrf_field()` helper in forms.
        *   Include the CSRF token in AJAX requests.
        *   Validate the CSRF token on the server-side for all state-changing requests.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Environment Variables](./threats/insecure_handling_of_environment_variables.md)

*   **Description:** If environment variables, which CodeIgniter 4 encourages the use of for sensitive configurations, are not properly secured (e.g., exposed in version control, accessible via the webserver), an attacker could gain access to these secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access to external services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Environment variable handling (`.env` file, `Config\App`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the `.env` file is not accessible through the web server (configure web server rules).
        *   Do not commit the `.env` file to version control.
        *   Use secure methods for managing and deploying environment variables in production environments.
