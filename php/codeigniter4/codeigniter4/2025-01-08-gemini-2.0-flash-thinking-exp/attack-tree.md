## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application Using CodeIgniter 4 Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_using_codeigniter_4_weaknesses.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities.md)

This category represents attacks targeting the way the application handles incoming requests and maps them to specific code. Weaknesses here can allow attackers to bypass intended logic or access unintended functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious data into parameters to bypass security checks or trigger unintended actions](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_parameters_to_bypass_security_checks_or_trigger_unintended_actions.md)

Attackers manipulate URL parameters to inject unexpected or malicious data. If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize these inputs, it can lead to vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, or logic flaws that allow unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Routes](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_routes.md)

This refers to errors in defining the application's routing rules. For example, leaving development or debugging routes accessible in a production environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access sensitive information or trigger administrative actions through these routes](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_information_or_trigger_administrative_actions_through_these_routes.md)

If misconfigured routes expose internal functionalities or sensitive data endpoints, attackers can directly access this information or trigger administrative actions without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Controller/Model Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_controllermodel_logic.md)

This category involves attacks targeting the core application logic within controllers and models, where data processing and business rules are implemented.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse of Query Builder Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_of_query_builder_vulnerabilities.md)

While CodeIgniter 4's Query Builder helps prevent direct SQL injection, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities by using raw queries with unsanitized input or by misunderstanding the Query Builder's limitations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious SQL through Query Builder to access or modify data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_through_query_builder_to_access_or_modify_data.md)

Attackers craft malicious SQL statements that are injected through the Query Builder, allowing them to directly interact with the database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Handling in Controllers](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_handling_in_controllers.md)

This refers to vulnerabilities arising from how the application handles file uploads, downloads, or file system operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities like path traversal, unrestricted file uploads, or insecure file storage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_like_path_traversal__unrestricted_file_uploads__or_insecure_file_storage.md)

**Path Traversal:** Attackers manipulate file paths to access files outside the intended directories.
    *   **Unrestricted File Uploads:** Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., scripts) that can be executed on the server.
    *   **Insecure File Storage:** Sensitive files are stored in publicly accessible locations or with insecure permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit View Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_view_vulnerabilities.md)

This category focuses on attacks targeting the presentation layer (views), where user-generated content is displayed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass or Misconfiguration of Output Escaping](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_or_misconfiguration_of_output_escaping.md)

CodeIgniter 4 provides auto-escaping to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), but developers can intentionally disable it or use raw output. If user-supplied data is rendered without proper escaping, it creates an XSS vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious scripts (XSS) or HTML to compromise user sessions or deface the application](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_scripts__xss__or_html_to_compromise_user_sessions_or_deface_the_application.md)

Attackers inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the application's output, which is then executed in the browsers of other users. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses.md)

This category involves attacks targeting misconfigurations in the application's settings and environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

Sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets are stored in configuration files (e.g., `.env`). If these files are accessible through the webserver due to misconfiguration, attackers can retrieve this critical information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_database_credentials__api_keys__or_other_sensitive_information.md)

Successful exposure of configuration data allows attackers to gain access to critical credentials, leading to further compromise of the application and potentially related services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Session Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_session_configuration.md)

This refers to weaknesses in how the application manages user sessions, such as using insecure cookie flags (e.g., missing `HttpOnly` or `Secure`), short session timeouts, or predictable session IDs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform session hijacking or replay attacks](./attack_tree_paths/perform_session_hijacking_or_replay_attacks.md)

Attackers can steal or intercept user session identifiers (e.g., cookies) and use them to impersonate legitimate users, gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_tree_paths/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

Leaving the debugging mode enabled in a production environment exposes sensitive information through error messages, stack traces, and debugging tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain sensitive information from error messages, stack traces, or debugging tools](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_sensitive_information_from_error_messages__stack_traces__or_debugging_tools.md)

When debug mode is enabled, error messages often reveal internal file paths, database details, and other information that can aid attackers in understanding the application's structure and identifying further vulnerabilities.
