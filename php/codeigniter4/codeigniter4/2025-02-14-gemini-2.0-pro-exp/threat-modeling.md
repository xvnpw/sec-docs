# Threat Model Analysis for codeigniter4/codeigniter4

## Threat: [Threat: Production Environment Exposure](./threats/threat_production_environment_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers that the application is running in a development or testing environment, either by observing verbose error messages, accessing exposed `.env` files, or finding debug information. The attacker leverages this information to gain access to sensitive data like database credentials, API keys, and application secrets. They might try accessing common development URLs (e.g., `/index.php/.env`), or look for error messages that reveal file paths or database connection strings.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise. The attacker gains full control over the database, can potentially execute arbitrary code, and steal sensitive user data.
*   **Affected Component:** `Config\App` (specifically `$CI_ENVIRONMENT` and `$baseURL`), `.env` file handling, web server configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Set `CI_ENVIRONMENT` to `production` on production servers.
    *   *Never* commit `.env` files to version control (use `.gitignore`).
    *   Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to deny access to `.env` files and other sensitive files/directories.
    *   Use server-level environment variables instead of `.env` files in production.
    *   Regularly audit server configurations and file permissions.

## Threat: [Threat: Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./threats/threat_debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker notices detailed error messages, stack traces, and potentially sensitive data displayed in the browser.  They use this information to understand the application's internal structure, identify potential vulnerabilities, and craft targeted exploits.  They might intentionally trigger errors to see what information is revealed.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure leading to easier exploitation. Attackers gain insights into the application's codebase, database structure, and configuration, making it easier to find and exploit other vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** `Config\App` (specifically `$CI_DEBUG`), error handling and reporting mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure `Config\App::$CI_DEBUG` is set to `false` in the production environment.
    *   Implement proper error logging to files (not the browser) using a logging library (e.g., CI4's built-in logging or a third-party library like Monolog).
    *   Configure the web server to display generic error pages to users.

## Threat: [Threat: `spark` Command Abuse](./threats/threat__spark__command_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary `spark` commands, potentially through a command injection vulnerability elsewhere in the application (e.g., a poorly sanitized form input that's passed to a `spark` command).  They use this to run migrations, seed the database with malicious data, or execute custom `spark` commands that perform harmful actions (e.g., creating an administrator user, deleting data, or even executing system commands if the custom command allows it).
*   **Impact:** Data modification, code execution, denial of service. The attacker can manipulate the database, potentially gain administrative access, or disrupt the application's functionality.
*   **Affected Component:** `spark` command-line tool, any custom `spark` commands, any code that executes `spark` commands based on user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to the `spark` command on production servers.  Ideally, it should only be accessible from the server's console, not through web requests.
    *   *Thoroughly* validate and sanitize any user input that is used within custom `spark` commands or when calling `spark` from within the application.  Use whitelisting and strict input validation techniques.
    *   Consider disabling `spark` entirely on production if it's not strictly necessary for runtime operations.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for any `spark` commands that perform sensitive actions.

## Threat: [Threat: Insecure File Uploads](./threats/threat_insecure_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a PHP script, an executable file, or a file with a double extension like `.php.jpg`) through a file upload form.  They exploit insufficient validation of file types, sizes, or names to bypass restrictions.  They then access the uploaded file directly (if it's within the web root) or trigger its execution through another vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data exfiltration, complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `CodeIgniter\Files\File`, `CodeIgniter\HTTP\Files\UploadedFile`, any file upload forms, any code that handles file uploads.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use CI4's `UploadedFile` class and its validation methods (`isValid()`, `getClientMimeType()`, `getSize()`, `getName()`, `hasMoved()`).
    *   *Never* trust the client-provided MIME type.  Validate the file extension against a strict whitelist of allowed types (e.g., `['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif']`).
    *   Store uploaded files *outside* the web root, if possible.  If they must be stored within the web root, use a dedicated directory with restricted access.
    *   Rename uploaded files to a unique, randomly generated name (e.g., using `random_string()`) to prevent directory traversal attacks and to avoid overwriting existing files.
    *   Limit file sizes to reasonable values using CI4's validation rules or server-side configuration.
    *   Consider using a virus scanner to scan uploaded files before storing them.
    *   Set appropriate file permissions on the upload directory.

## Threat: [Threat: Session Hijacking](./threats/threat_session_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker steals a user's session ID (e.g., through XSS, network sniffing, or by finding a predictable session ID) and uses it to impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to their account and data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, data theft, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** `CodeIgniter\Session\Session`, `Config\Session`, any code that relies on session data for authentication or authorization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use HTTPS for *all* session-related traffic (enforce HTTPS sitewide).
    *   Configure the session library (`Config\Session`) with strong settings:
        *   Use a secure session driver (e.g., `DatabaseHandler`, `RedisHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`).  Avoid the `FileHandler` if possible, or ensure the save path is secure.
        *   Set a unique and unpredictable `sessionCookieName`.
        *   Set a reasonable `sessionExpiration` time.
        *   Ensure `sessionSavePath` is a secure location outside the web root, with appropriate permissions.
        *   Consider enabling `sessionMatchIP` for added security (but be aware of potential issues with users behind proxies or with dynamic IPs).
        *   Set a reasonable `sessionTimeToUpdate` for session ID regeneration.
        *   Set `sessionRegenerateDestroy` to `true` to destroy old session data after regeneration.
        *   Use `sessionRegenerate()` to regenerate the session ID after a user logs in, changes their password, or their privileges change.
    *   Store only essential data in the session; avoid storing sensitive information directly in the session.
    *   Implement additional security measures like two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Threat: [Threat: Zero-Day Vulnerability in CodeIgniter 4](./threats/threat_zero-day_vulnerability_in_codeigniter_4.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in the CodeIgniter 4 framework itself.  The specific attack vector depends on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution and complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of the CodeIgniter 4 framework.
*   **Risk Severity:** Unknown (potentially Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep CodeIgniter 4 up to date.  Apply security patches and updates promptly.  Subscribe to the CodeIgniter security announcements.
    *   Monitor the CodeIgniter forums, GitHub repository, and security advisories for announcements of new vulnerabilities.
    *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of defense and potentially mitigate zero-day exploits.
    *   Follow secure coding practices throughout your application to minimize the impact of any potential framework vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Threat: Vulnerability in Third-Party Library](./threats/threat_vulnerability_in_third-party_library.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party library that is used by CodeIgniter 4. The attack vector depends on the specific library and vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerable library and the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
* **Affected Component:** The specific third-party library and any CodeIgniter 4 code that uses it.
* **Risk Severity:** Unknown (potentially Critical)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep third-party libraries up to date using Composer (`composer update`).
    *   Use a dependency checker (e.g., `composer audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to identify outdated or vulnerable libraries.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the specific libraries used by your application.
    *   Consider using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
    *   If a vulnerable library is identified, update it to a patched version as soon as possible. If no patch is available, consider temporarily disabling the affected functionality or finding an alternative library.
