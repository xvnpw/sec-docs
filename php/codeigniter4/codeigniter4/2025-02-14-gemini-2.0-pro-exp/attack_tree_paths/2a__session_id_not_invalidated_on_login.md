Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on CodeIgniter 4 (CI4) applications.

## Deep Analysis: Session ID Not Invalidated on Login (Attack Tree Path 2a)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to determine the *actual* risk and mitigation strategies for the "Session ID Not Invalidated on Login" vulnerability within a CodeIgniter 4 application.  We aim to go beyond the initial attack tree assessment and provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers.  This includes understanding *how* CI4 handles session regeneration, identifying potential misconfigurations, and providing code-level examples for secure implementation.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **CodeIgniter 4 Framework:**  We are *not* analyzing general PHP session handling, but rather how CI4's built-in session library and configuration options interact with this vulnerability.
*   **Login Process:**  The analysis centers on the user authentication flow, specifically the point immediately *after* successful credential verification.
*   **Session ID Regeneration:** We will examine the mechanisms (or lack thereof) for generating new session IDs upon successful login.
*   **Configuration Settings:**  We will investigate relevant configuration parameters within CI4 that impact session security, particularly those related to session regeneration.
*   **Common Developer Practices:** We will consider how developers typically implement login functionality in CI4 and identify potential pitfalls.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the relevant source code of the CodeIgniter 4 framework, specifically the `system/Session` directory and any related authentication libraries or helpers.  This will reveal the default behavior and available configuration options.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will analyze the default `app/Config/App.php` and `app/Config/Session.php` configuration files, paying close attention to session-related settings.
3.  **Vulnerability Testing (Conceptual):** We will describe how to *conceptually* test for this vulnerability in a CI4 application.  While we won't execute live attacks, we'll outline the steps a penetration tester would take.
4.  **Best Practice Research:** We will consult official CodeIgniter 4 documentation and reputable security resources to identify recommended practices for session management.
5.  **Code Example Generation:** We will provide concrete code examples demonstrating both vulnerable and secure implementations of session handling during login.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

**2a. Session ID Not Invalidated on Login**

**2.1. CodeIgniter 4's Session Handling:**

CodeIgniter 4 provides a robust session library (`system/Session/Session.php` and related handlers).  Crucially, CI4 *does* have built-in mechanisms for session ID regeneration.  The key configuration parameter is `$sessionRegenerateDestroy` in `app/Config/Session.php`.

*   **`$sessionRegenerateDestroy = false;` (Default - and INSECURE in this context):**  When set to `false`, CI4 will regenerate the session ID *periodically* based on `$sessionTimeToUpdate`.  However, it *won't* automatically regenerate the ID upon login *and* it won't destroy the old session. This is the core of the vulnerability.  An attacker could pre-set a session ID, and if the user logs in without the ID changing, the attacker retains access.

*   **`$sessionRegenerateDestroy = true;` (More Secure):** When set to `true`, CI4 will regenerate the session ID and *destroy* the old session data associated with the previous ID whenever the session is updated (including during the periodic regeneration).  This significantly reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker, but it *still* doesn't guarantee regeneration *specifically* on login.

**2.2. The Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists when:

1.  `$sessionRegenerateDestroy` is `false` (or even if it's `true`, but the developer doesn't explicitly regenerate on login).
2.  The application does *not* explicitly call `$session->regenerate()` (or equivalent) immediately *after* successful user authentication.

**2.3. Conceptual Vulnerability Testing:**

1.  **Set a Session ID:**  Use a browser's developer tools (or a proxy like Burp Suite) to manually set a session cookie (e.g., `ci_session`) to a known value (e.g., "attacker_session_id").
2.  **Attempt Login:**  Log in to the application using valid credentials.
3.  **Inspect Session ID:**  Immediately after successful login, check the value of the `ci_session` cookie.
4.  **Vulnerability Confirmation:**
    *   If the `ci_session` cookie *remains* "attacker_session_id", the vulnerability is present.
    *   If the `ci_session` cookie has changed to a *new* value, the application is likely (but not guaranteed) to be secure.  Further testing would be needed to ensure the old session is truly invalidated.
5. **Test session in old browser:** Check if you are logged in, in browser where you set up session ID.

**2.4. Code Examples:**

**Vulnerable Code (Illustrative - DO NOT USE):**

```php
// In a controller's login method:

public function login()
{
    $model = new UserModel();
    $email = $this->request->getPost('email');
    $password = $this->request->getPost('password');

    $user = $model->where('email', $email)->first();

    if ($user && password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {
        // Store user data in the session (INSECURE - no session regeneration!)
        $this->session->set('user_id', $user['id']);
        $this->session->set('username', $user['username']);

        return redirect()->to('/dashboard');
    } else {
        // Handle login failure
    }
}
```

**Secure Code (Recommended):**

```php
// In a controller's login method:

public function login()
{
    $model = new UserModel();
    $email = $this->request->getPost('email');
    $password = $this->request->getPost('password');

    $user = $model->where('email', $email)->first();

    if ($user && password_verify($password, $user['password'])) {
        // **SECURE: Regenerate the session ID immediately after successful login**
        $this->session->regenerate(); // This is the crucial line!

        // Store user data in the session
        $this->session->set('user_id', $user['id']);
        $this->session->set('username', $user['username']);

        return redirect()->to('/dashboard');
    } else {
        // Handle login failure
    }
}
```

**2.5. Configuration Recommendations:**

*   **`app/Config/Session.php`:**
    *   **`$sessionRegenerateDestroy = true;`:**  While not a complete solution on its own, setting this to `true` is a good security practice. It destroys old session data when the ID is regenerated, reducing the impact of other potential session-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **`$sessionTimeToUpdate = 300;`:**  A reasonable value (5 minutes) for periodic session regeneration.  This provides an additional layer of defense, but it's *not* a substitute for regenerating on login.
    *   **`$sessionMatchIP = false;`:**  Generally, avoid matching the session to the user's IP address.  This can cause problems for users behind proxies or with dynamic IPs.  It's better to rely on strong session ID management.
    *   **`$sessionMatchUserAgent = false;`:** Similar to IP matching, avoid tying the session to the User-Agent.  User-Agents can be easily spoofed, and legitimate users might change browsers.
    *   **Use a secure session handler:** Consider using a database or Redis session handler instead of the default file-based handler, especially for high-traffic applications. This improves performance and can enhance security.

**2.6. Mitigation Summary:**

The *primary* mitigation is to **explicitly call `$this->session->regenerate();` immediately after successful authentication.**  This ensures that a new, unpredictable session ID is generated, preventing an attacker from hijacking a pre-set session.  Setting `$sessionRegenerateDestroy = true;` is a valuable secondary measure.

**2.7. Likelihood Reassessment:**

The initial assessment rated the likelihood as "Low" based on the assumption that CI4 *should* encourage regeneration.  However, the deep analysis reveals that the *default* configuration is vulnerable, and the critical `regenerate()` call is *not* automatically included in a basic login flow.  Therefore, the likelihood should be reassessed as **Medium** or even **High**, depending on developer awareness and adherence to best practices.  Many developers might not be aware of this specific vulnerability and might rely on the framework's defaults without realizing the risk.

**2.8. Impact and Other Factors:**

*   **Impact:** Remains **Very High** (complete session hijacking, leading to unauthorized access to user data and functionality).
*   **Effort:** Remains **Low** (setting a session cookie is trivial).
*   **Skill Level:** Remains **Intermediate** (requires understanding of session handling and basic web security concepts).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Remains **Hard** (requires monitoring session ID changes and correlating them with login events, which is not typically done by default).

### 3. Conclusion

The "Session ID Not Invalidated on Login" vulnerability is a serious security concern in CodeIgniter 4 applications if not properly addressed.  While CI4 provides the necessary tools for secure session management, the default configuration and the need for explicit regeneration on login create a significant risk.  Developers *must* be aware of this vulnerability and implement the recommended mitigation (calling `$this->session->regenerate();` after successful authentication) to protect their applications and users.  The likelihood of this vulnerability being present in a CI4 application is higher than initially assessed due to the framework's default behavior and the potential for developer oversight.
