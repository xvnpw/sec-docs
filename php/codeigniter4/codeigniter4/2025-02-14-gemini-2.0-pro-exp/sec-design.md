Okay, let's create a design document for the CodeIgniter 4 project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

CodeIgniter 4 is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. It is designed for developers who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications.  The primary business goal is to provide a robust and efficient framework that enables rapid development of web applications while maintaining a high level of security and performance.  The framework's adoption and community support are key indicators of its success.

Business Priorities:

*   Enable rapid web application development.
*   Provide a secure and stable framework.
*   Maintain a lightweight and performant codebase.
*   Foster a strong and active community.
*   Ensure ease of use and learning for developers.
*   Provide clear and comprehensive documentation.

Business Goals:

*   Increase adoption and usage of the framework.
*   Maintain a positive reputation for security and reliability.
*   Attract and retain contributors to the project.
*   Become a preferred choice for PHP developers.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to widespread exploitation of applications built with it, damaging the framework's reputation and user trust.
*   Performance issues or instability could deter developers from using the framework.
*   Lack of community engagement or contributions could lead to stagnation and obsolescence.
*   Failure to keep up with modern PHP standards and best practices could make the framework less attractive compared to alternatives.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could hinder adoption and usage.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input Validation: CodeIgniter 4 provides built-in libraries and helpers for input validation and filtering, helping to prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. (Described in documentation and implemented in system libraries).
*   security control: Output Encoding: The framework encourages output encoding to prevent XSS attacks. (Described in documentation and implemented in system libraries).
*   security control: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: CodeIgniter 4 has built-in CSRF protection mechanisms. (Described in documentation and implemented in system libraries).
*   security control: SQL Injection Prevention: The framework's database abstraction layer uses parameterized queries or query builder, which helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. (Described in documentation and implemented in system libraries).
*   security control: Session Management: CodeIgniter 4 provides secure session management features. (Described in documentation and implemented in system libraries).
*   security control: Encryption: The framework offers encryption services for sensitive data. (Described in documentation and implemented in system libraries).
*   security control: Password Hashing: CodeIgniter 4 recommends and supports strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). (Described in documentation).
*   security control: Security Policy: CodeIgniter 4 has a security policy that describes how to report security vulnerabilities. (Described in SECURITY.md file).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The framework relies on the underlying PHP environment and server configuration for some security aspects. Misconfigurations in these areas could expose applications to risks.
*   accepted risk: While the framework provides security features, developers are ultimately responsible for implementing them correctly and securely in their applications.
*   accepted risk: Third-party libraries or modules used with CodeIgniter 4 may introduce their own security vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks.
*   security control: Regularly update the framework and all dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of applications built with CodeIgniter 4.
*   security control: Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS connections.
*   security control: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The framework should provide mechanisms for secure user authentication, including support for strong password hashing and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Session management should be secure, protecting against session hijacking and fixation attacks.

*   Authorization:
    *   The framework should support role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive resources.
    *   Authorization checks should be enforced consistently throughout the application.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input should be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).
    *   Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
    *   Strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices should be used.
