## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CI4 Application Configuration/Deployment](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_ci4_application_configurationdeployment.md)

*   *Description:* This branch represents vulnerabilities arising from mistakes made by developers *using* CodeIgniter 4, rather than flaws within the framework itself. This is the most likely area for exploitable weaknesses.
    *   *Why High-Risk:* Configuration errors are common, often easy to exploit, and can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Session Fixation](./attack_tree_paths/2__session_fixation.md)

*   *Description:* Attacks that involve setting a user's session ID to a known value, allowing the attacker to hijack their session after they authenticate.
    *   *Why High-Risk:* Session hijacking grants the attacker full access to the user's account, potentially including administrative privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [2a. Session ID not Invalidated on Login](./attack_tree_paths/2a__session_id_not_invalidated_on_login.md)

*   *Description:* If the application doesn't generate a new session ID after a user successfully logs in, an attacker who previously set the session ID can hijack the authenticated session.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (CI4 *should* encourage regeneration, but it's a critical configuration point).
        *   *Impact:* Very High (Complete session hijacking).
        *   *Effort:* Low (Requires setting a session ID before the user logs in).
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate.
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard (Requires monitoring session ID changes and correlating them with logins).

## Attack Tree Path: [2b. Session Fixation via URL](./attack_tree_paths/2b__session_fixation_via_url.md)

*   *Description:* If the application accepts session IDs from the URL (e.g., via GET parameters), an attacker can easily set the session ID by sending a crafted link to the victim.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (CI4 discourages this; requires explicit misconfiguration).
        *   *Impact:* Very High (Easy session hijacking).
        *   *Effort:* Very Low (Simply including the session ID in a URL).
        *   *Skill Level:* Beginner.
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Can be detected by monitoring for session IDs in URLs).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Weak Crypto](./attack_tree_paths/5__weak_crypto.md)

*    *Description:* Using weak cryptographic algorithms or practices, making it easier for attackers to decrypt sensitive data or crack passwords.
    *    *Why High-Risk:* Weak crypto undermines the confidentiality and integrity of data.

## Attack Tree Path: [5b. Predictable Encryption Keys (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/5b__predictable_encryption_keys__critical_node_.md)

*   *Description:* Using hardcoded, easily guessable, or improperly stored encryption keys. If an attacker obtains the encryption key, they can decrypt *all* data encrypted with that key.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (Requires poor key management practices).
        *   *Impact:* Very High (Compromised encryption keys allow decryption of all encrypted data).
        *   *Effort:* Medium (Requires finding the encryption key, which might be hardcoded, in a configuration file, or in environment variables).
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate.
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard (Requires access to the server's configuration or code).

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Debug Mode Enabled](./attack_tree_paths/6__debug_mode_enabled.md)

*   *Description:* Leaving debugging features enabled in a production environment, which can leak sensitive information about the application.
    *   *Why High-Risk:* Debug information can provide attackers with valuable insights into the application's inner workings, vulnerabilities, and even source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [6a. Production Server Exposed](./attack_tree_paths/6a__production_server_exposed.md)

*   *Description:* If `$this->CI_DEBUG` or similar debugging features are enabled in production, error messages and other debug information are displayed to users, potentially revealing sensitive details.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (This is a basic configuration error; should be caught in deployment procedures).
        *   *Impact:* High (Leaks sensitive information about the application).
        *   *Effort:* Very Low (Simply accessing the application).
        *   *Skill Level:* Beginner.
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Easy (Visible error messages and debug information).

## Attack Tree Path: [6b. Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/6b__sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   *Description:* Debug messages might contain sensitive data, such as database credentials, API keys, or user information.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (Depends on what information is included in debug messages).
        *   *Impact:* High (Can expose credentials, API keys, etc.).
        *   *Effort:* Very Low (Reading the debug output).
        *   *Skill Level:* Beginner.
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Easy (Visible in the debug output).

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/7__default_credentials.md)

*   *Description:* Failing to change default credentials for administrative or other privileged accounts.
    *   *Why High-Risk:* Default credentials are often well-known and provide an easy entry point for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [7a. Default Admin Password (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/7a__default_admin_password__critical_node_.md)

*   *Description:* If the application uses a default administrative account (e.g., "admin/admin") and the password isn't changed, it's an extremely easy target.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low (CI4 doesn't ship with a default admin account; requires the application developer to create one and not change the password).
        *   *Impact:* Very High (Complete administrative access).
        *   *Effort:* Very Low (Trying a well-known default password).
        *   *Skill Level:* Beginner.
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy (Failed login attempts might be logged).

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Misconfigured Shield](./attack_tree_paths/8__misconfigured_shield.md)

*   *Description:* CodeIgniter 4's Shield is an authentication and authorization library. Misconfiguring it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   *Why High-Risk:* If authentication and authorization are not properly configured, attackers can bypass security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [8b. Missing CSRF Protection](./attack_tree_paths/8b__missing_csrf_protection.md)

*   *Description:* Failing to enable or properly use Shield's CSRF protection, making the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.  Attackers can trick users into performing actions they didn't intend.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium (Requires disabling or misconfiguring Shield's CSRF protection).
        *   *Impact:* High (Allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users).
        *   *Effort:* Medium (Requires crafting a malicious request and tricking the user into submitting it).
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate.
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (Requires analyzing the application's forms and requests for CSRF tokens).

## Attack Tree Path: [4a. Unsafe `unserialize` Usage (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/4a__unsafe__unserialize__usage__critical_node_.md)

*   *Description:* If the application uses PHP's `unserialize()` function on untrusted data (data that comes from the user or an external source), it can lead to object injection and arbitrary code execution. This is a very serious vulnerability.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (CI4 doesn't encourage this; requires explicit developer action).
    *   *Impact:* Very High (Potential for arbitrary code execution).
    *   *Effort:* High (Requires finding a place where user input is deserialized and crafting a malicious payload).
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced.
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard (Requires static code analysis and dynamic testing).
