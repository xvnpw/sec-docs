# BUSINESS POSTURE

CodeIgniter is a PHP framework designed to provide a simple, elegant toolkit for building full-featured web applications. It aims to be lightweight, fast, and developer-friendly, offering a robust set of libraries and helpers while minimizing complexity.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Rapid web application development: CodeIgniter prioritizes ease of use and a straightforward structure to accelerate the development process.
- Performance: The framework is designed to be lightweight and fast, ensuring efficient application performance.
- Flexibility: CodeIgniter offers a flexible architecture that allows developers to adapt it to various project needs and coding styles.
- Community Support: A strong and active community provides support, resources, and contributions to the framework's development.
- Open Source: Being open source, CodeIgniter benefits from community contributions, transparency, and cost-effectiveness.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in applications built using CodeIgniter: If developers do not follow secure coding practices or if vulnerabilities exist within the framework itself, applications built with CodeIgniter can be susceptible to attacks.
- Framework vulnerabilities: Undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities in the CodeIgniter framework could be exploited, affecting all applications built on it.
- Lack of security awareness among developers: Developers unfamiliar with secure coding practices might introduce vulnerabilities into their applications, regardless of the framework's security features.
- Dependency vulnerabilities: CodeIgniter and applications built on it may rely on third-party libraries that could contain vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Input validation libraries and helpers are provided within the framework to assist developers in sanitizing user inputs. (Implemented in framework libraries and documented in user guide)
- security control: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection helpers are available to mitigate XSS attacks. (Implemented in framework libraries and documented in user guide)
- security control: CSRF protection is offered as a feature that can be enabled to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. (Implemented as a framework feature and documented in user guide)
- security control: Database abstraction layer helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by encouraging parameterized queries. (Implemented in framework database library)
- security control: Password hashing utilities are provided to securely store user passwords. (Implemented in framework security library)
- security control: Security documentation is available in the user guide, providing guidance on secure development practices. (Documented in user guide)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration of security features by developers. Developers might not enable or correctly configure security features like CSRF protection or input validation.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities introduced by custom code. Security of applications heavily depends on the secure coding practices of individual developers, and custom code can introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Outdated dependencies. Applications might use outdated versions of CodeIgniter or third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
- accepted risk: Server and infrastructure security. Security of the underlying server and infrastructure is outside the scope of the framework itself and relies on proper server hardening and maintenance.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the development pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- security control: Implement Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools to test the running application for vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to manage and monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Conduct regular security code reviews to identify and address potential security flaws in the code.
- security control: Provide security training for developers to enhance their awareness of secure coding practices and common web application vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to allow security researchers to report potential vulnerabilities responsibly.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: The framework should provide mechanisms for secure user authentication.
    - Requirement: Support for various authentication methods (e.g., username/password, multi-factor authentication) should be considered for applications built with the framework.
    - Requirement: Session management should be secure and protect against session hijacking and fixation attacks.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: The framework should facilitate the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization mechanisms.
    - Requirement: Granular control over access to different parts of the application and data should be achievable.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms must be available to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied to all user inputs, including request parameters, headers, and file uploads.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Secure cryptographic functions should be used for sensitive operations like password hashing and data encryption.
    - Requirement: Support for secure communication protocols (HTTPS) should be enforced for applications built with the framework.
    - Requirement: Proper handling and storage of cryptographic keys should be ensured.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Running web applications built using CodeIgniter: The primary business process is the operation of web applications developed with the framework, providing services and functionalities to end-users. Disruption or compromise of these applications can directly impact business operations, revenue, and reputation.

Data Sensitivity:
- Application Data: The sensitivity of data depends on the specific applications built using CodeIgniter. It can range from publicly accessible information to highly sensitive personal data, financial records, or proprietary business information. The sensitivity level is application-specific and needs to be assessed for each application built with the framework.
- User Data: Applications may collect and store user data, which can include personal information (PII), credentials, and usage data. The sensitivity of user data is generally high, especially with increasing privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Protecting user data is crucial for compliance and maintaining user trust.
- Configuration Data: Application and framework configuration data, including database credentials, API keys, and other secrets, are highly sensitive. Exposure of configuration data can lead to unauthorized access and system compromise.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What type of applications are being built with CodeIgniter? (e.g., e-commerce, CMS, APIs, internal tools). The type of application will influence the specific security requirements and risks.
- What is the expected scale and performance requirements of the applications? This will impact deployment architecture and security considerations related to performance and availability.
- What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that applications built with CodeIgniter need to adhere to? Compliance requirements will dictate specific security controls and processes.
- What is the organization's risk appetite? A higher risk appetite might lead to accepting more security risks in favor of faster development or lower costs.
- What is the level of security expertise within the development team? The team's security knowledge will influence the effectiveness of security controls implementation.

Assumptions:
- CodeIgniter is used to build typical web applications that interact with users through web browsers and store data in databases.
- Applications are deployed in a cloud environment using virtual machines and managed services.
- Security is a relevant concern for applications built with CodeIgniter, and a reasonable level of security is desired.
- Developers using CodeIgniter have varying levels of security awareness and expertise.
- The organization deploying applications built with CodeIgniter has some existing security infrastructure and practices in place.
