# Attack Surface Analysis for codeigniter4/codeigniter4

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Route Parameters](./attack_surfaces/insecure_route_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from insufficient validation and sanitization of parameters passed through URL routes.
*   **CodeIgniter 4 Contribution:** CodeIgniter 4's routing system allows flexible parameter handling, placing the responsibility for secure parameter validation and sanitization on the developer. Lack of built-in, enforced validation at the routing level directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A route like `/files/{filename}`. If the controller uses `$filename` directly in `file_get_contents($filename)` without validation, an attacker could use `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` for Path Traversal and access sensitive files.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, sensitive data disclosure, potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Mandatory validation of all route parameters within controllers using CodeIgniter 4's input validation library or custom validation rules.
    *   **Parameter Type Hinting:** Utilize type hinting in controller methods to enforce expected data types for route parameters as a first line of defense.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode output if route parameters are reflected in responses to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Minimize web server user permissions to limit the impact of file access vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Query Builder Misuse](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_query_builder_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries due to improper or insecure usage of CodeIgniter 4's Query Builder or by resorting to raw queries with unsanitized input.
*   **CodeIgniter 4 Contribution:** While Query Builder is designed to prevent SQL injection, developers can bypass its security by using raw queries or incorrectly applying escaping functions. The framework's security relies on developers adhering to secure Query Builder practices.
*   **Example:** Using `$db->query("SELECT * FROM items WHERE item_name = '" . $_GET['item'] . "'")` directly embeds unsanitized user input, creating a direct SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker could inject `'; DELETE FROM items; --` as the `item` parameter.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized database access, potential denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Query Builder:**  Strictly use CodeIgniter 4's Query Builder with bound parameters or parameterized queries for all database interactions.
    *   **Avoid Raw Queries with User Input:**  Eliminate the use of `$db->query()` with directly embedded user input. If absolutely necessary, use `$db->escape()` or `$db->escapeString()` with extreme caution and thorough validation, but parameterized queries are always preferred.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate user inputs before database interaction to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected SQL syntax.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database):**  Grant minimal necessary database privileges to the application user to restrict the impact of SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to Lack of Output Encoding](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__due_to_lack_of_output_encoding.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users because of insufficient or missing output encoding of user-controlled data within CodeIgniter 4 views.
*   **CodeIgniter 4 Contribution:** CodeIgniter 4 provides the `esc()` function and global XSS filtering as security features. However, effective XSS prevention depends on developers consistently using `esc()` in views and understanding the limitations of global filtering. Neglecting proper output encoding directly leads to XSS vulnerabilities within the framework's view rendering process.
*   **Example:** Displaying user-generated content in a view using `<div><?= $userInput ?></div>` without encoding. An attacker could submit `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` as `$userInput`, resulting in script execution in other users' browsers.
*   **Impact:** Account hijacking, session theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, sensitive information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Mandatory use of CodeIgniter 4's `esc()` function in all views to encode output based on the context (HTML, URL, JavaScript, CSS).
    *   **Understand Global XSS Filtering Limitations:**  Treat global XSS filtering as a secondary defense layer, not a primary solution. Focus on context-aware output encoding.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust Content Security Policy to further mitigate XSS risks by controlling resource loading and script execution policies in the browser.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious code into template variables that are processed server-side by the templating engine, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution.
*   **CodeIgniter 4 Contribution:** While CodeIgniter 4's default templating is generally safe for basic usage, vulnerabilities can arise if developers improperly handle user input within templates or integrate more complex templating engines without understanding SSTI risks.  Misuse of template features in CodeIgniter 4 can create SSTI attack vectors.
*   **Example:** If using a custom or more advanced templating engine integrated with CodeIgniter 4, and allowing user input to directly influence template logic like `{{ user.name }}` where `user` object is dynamically constructed from user input without sanitization, an attacker might inject template commands to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Unsafe Template Variable Handling:**  Never directly embed unsanitized user input into template logic or code execution contexts within CodeIgniter 4 views.
    *   **Use Secure Templating Practices:**  Adhere to secure templating practices specific to the templating engine being used within the CodeIgniter 4 application.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize user input rigorously before using it in templates, even for seemingly benign display purposes.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Server):**  Run the web server with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential RCE vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/debug_mode_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving debug mode enabled in a production environment, exposing sensitive application details and aiding attackers in reconnaissance and exploitation.
*   **CodeIgniter 4 Contribution:** CodeIgniter 4's debug mode, controlled by the `CI_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable, is a framework feature. The framework relies on developers to correctly configure this setting for production environments. Failure to disable debug mode in production is a direct configuration vulnerability related to CodeIgniter 4.
*   **Example:** With debug mode active, error pages in production reveal full file paths, database connection details, and potentially sensitive configuration information. This information can be invaluable for attackers to map the application structure and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, easier vulnerability exploitation, potential path traversal vulnerabilities revealed through error messages.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Debug Mode in Production:**  Ensure `CI_ENVIRONMENT` is explicitly set to `production` in production server environments.
    *   **Custom Error Handling:** Implement custom error handling and logging within the CodeIgniter 4 application for production to prevent exposing sensitive details in error responses.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review application configuration, specifically the `CI_ENVIRONMENT` setting, to confirm debug mode is disabled in production.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed `.env` File](./attack_surfaces/exposed___env__file.md)

*   **Description:** Making the `.env` file, containing sensitive configuration data for CodeIgniter 4, publicly accessible via the web server.
*   **CodeIgniter 4 Contribution:** CodeIgniter 4 utilizes the `.env` file for environment-specific configurations, including sensitive credentials. While the framework itself doesn't expose the file, improper server configuration in a CodeIgniter 4 deployment can lead to public accessibility, making it a vulnerability directly related to deploying a CodeIgniter 4 application.
*   **Example:** If the web server is misconfigured to serve static files from the application root directory, an attacker could directly request `/.env` through a web browser and download the file, gaining access to database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive configuration parameters.
*   **Impact:** Full application compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to external services, and complete loss of confidentiality.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server Configuration:**  Properly configure the web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to explicitly deny direct access to the `.env` file and other sensitive files and directories within the CodeIgniter 4 application structure.
    *   **`.htaccess` (Apache):** Utilize `.htaccess` rules to deny access to `.env` if using Apache.
    *   **Nginx Configuration:**  Configure Nginx `location` blocks to specifically deny access to the `.env` file.
    *   **Move `.env` Outside Web Root:**  For enhanced security, consider moving the `.env` file outside the web root directory entirely, if the deployment environment allows, and adjust the application bootstrap to load it from the non-public location.
