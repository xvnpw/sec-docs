# Threat Model Analysis for codeigniter4/codeigniter4

## Threat: [Insecure `ENVIRONMENT` Setting](./threats/insecure__environment__setting.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a production environment running with the `ENVIRONMENT` setting set to `development` or `testing`. This grants access to the Debug Toolbar and detailed error messages, revealing sensitive information like database credentials, application paths, and configuration details. Attackers can use this information to further compromise the application and its underlying infrastructure.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, Potential System Compromise, Privilege Escalation.

**CodeIgniter 4 Component Affected:** `index.php` (entry point), Environment Configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the `ENVIRONMENT` constant in `index.php` is set to `production` for live deployments.
*   Restrict access to debugging tools and detailed error logs in production environments.
*   Implement robust logging and monitoring practices in production.

## Threat: [Default or Weak `encryptionKey`](./threats/default_or_weak__encryptionkey_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could crack or guess a default or weak `encryptionKey` used by CodeIgniter 4. Successful decryption allows access to sensitive data encrypted with this key, including session data, cookies, and potentially other application-specific encrypted information. This can lead to session hijacking, unauthorized account access, and data breaches.

**Impact:** Session Hijacking, Data Breach, Account Takeover, Loss of Confidentiality.

**CodeIgniter 4 Component Affected:** Encryption Service, Session Library, Cookie Handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Generate a strong, unique, and cryptographically secure `encryptionKey`.
*   Store the `encryptionKey` securely, outside the webroot and version control.
*   Rotate the `encryptionKey` periodically as a security best practice.
*   Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management for key storage.

## Threat: [Exposed `writable` Directory](./threats/exposed__writable__directory.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain direct access to the `writable` directory if the web server is misconfigured. This allows them to read sensitive files such as application logs and session files. If vulnerable file upload functionality exists, attackers might upload and execute malicious files (like web shells) within the `writable` directory, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure (logs, session data), Remote Code Execution (if uploads are vulnerable), Data Tampering.

**CodeIgniter 4 Component Affected:** Web Server Configuration, File Handling, Logging, Session Management, Upload Library (if used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure the web server to prevent direct access to the `writable` directory from the web.
*   Set restrictive directory permissions for the `writable` directory, limiting access to the web server user only.
*   Regularly audit and secure file upload functionality if implemented.

## Threat: [Publicly Accessible Routes to Sensitive Functionality](./threats/publicly_accessible_routes_to_sensitive_functionality.md)

**Description:** An attacker could access administrative panels, internal application logic, or sensitive data if routes are not adequately protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms. Poorly designed routing configurations can unintentionally expose sensitive controllers or methods, allowing direct access without proper access controls.

**Impact:** Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data, Privilege Escalation, Data Manipulation, System Compromise.

**CodeIgniter 4 Component Affected:** Routing, Controllers, Filters, Authorization Mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (Filters, Guards).
*   Apply authentication and authorization filters to all routes handling sensitive operations.
*   Design routes following the principle of least privilege.
*   Utilize Route Groups and Namespaces for better route organization and security management.
*   Regularly audit route configurations for unintended public exposure of sensitive endpoints.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Route Filters](./threats/misconfigured_route_filters.md)

**Description:** An attacker could bypass security filters (authentication, authorization, CSRF protection) if they are misconfigured or contain logic errors. This allows unauthorized access to protected routes and functionalities, potentially bypassing intended security measures and leading to CSRF attacks if CSRF filters are affected.

**Impact:** Unauthorized Access, CSRF Attacks, Privilege Escalation, Data Manipulation.

**CodeIgniter 4 Component Affected:** Routing, Filters.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test and review Route Filter configurations.
*   Ensure filters are correctly applied to the intended routes.
*   Verify that filter logic is robust and secure against bypass attempts.
*   Pay close attention to filter ordering and potential bypass scenarios.
*   Implement automated tests to validate filter functionality and security.

## Threat: [Disabled or Misconfigured CSRF Protection](./threats/disabled_or_misconfigured_csrf_protection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can execute Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks if CSRF protection is disabled or misconfigured in CodeIgniter 4. By tricking a logged-in user, attackers can force them to perform unintended actions on the application, such as changing passwords, making unauthorized transactions, or modifying data, without the user's awareness or consent.

**Impact:** CSRF Attacks, Unauthorized Actions on Behalf of Users, Data Manipulation, Account Compromise.

**CodeIgniter 4 Component Affected:** CSRF Protection Middleware, Form Helpers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in `app/Config/Security.php`.
*   Review and configure CSRF settings appropriately (token name, cookie name, regeneration settings).
*   Utilize the `csrf_token()` and `csrf_field()` helpers in forms to include CSRF tokens.
*   Implement CSRF protection for AJAX requests and APIs as well.
*   Regularly test CSRF protection to confirm its effectiveness.

## Threat: [Session Security Misconfigurations](./threats/session_security_misconfigurations.md)

**Description:** An attacker can hijack user sessions or perform session fixation attacks if session management is insecurely configured within CodeIgniter 4. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data. Insecure configurations include using default file-based session drivers in production, weak cookie settings (missing `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags), inadequate session timeouts, or predictable session IDs.

**Impact:** Session Hijacking, Session Fixation, Account Takeover, Unauthorized Access.

**CodeIgniter 4 Component Affected:** Session Library, Cookie Handling, Configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure session settings in `app/Config/Session.php` with security in mind.
*   Use database or Redis session drivers for production instead of file-based sessions for improved security and scalability.
*   Set appropriate session timeouts to limit the lifespan of sessions.
*   Configure session cookies with `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags to enhance security.
*   Consider implementing session fingerprinting to detect and prevent session hijacking attempts.
*   Regenerate session IDs after user authentication to mitigate session fixation vulnerabilities.
