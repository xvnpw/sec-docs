## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses - High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_-_high-risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Configuration vulnerabilities arising from insecure setup or oversight in managing application settings.
*   **Risk Level:** High, due to the potential for direct access to sensitive data and system compromise.
*   **Mitigation Priority:** Highest, as configuration errors are often easily exploitable and have significant impact.

    *   **1.1. Misconfigured Environment Variables - High-Risk Path:**
        *   **Attack Step:** Expose sensitive environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys) via debug pages or logs. - **Critical Node**
            *   **Description:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive configuration details if environment variables are inadvertently exposed. This can happen through:
                *   Leaving debug mode enabled in production, which often displays environment variables in error pages or debug tools.
                *   Logging environment variables in application logs that are accessible to attackers (e.g., due to misconfigured logging or exposed log files).
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common mistake, especially in initial deployments or rapid development cycles.
            *   **Impact:** High - Exposure of database credentials, API keys, or other secrets can lead to full application and data compromise, unauthorized access to external services, and significant data breaches.
            *   **Effort:** Low - Easy to exploit if debug mode is enabled or logs are accessible.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires minimal technical skill.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Easily detectable by attackers if debug mode is on or logs are exposed.
            *   **Actionable Insight:**
                *   **Disable debug mode in production environments.**
                *   **Implement secure environment variable management:**
                    *   Use `.env` files (properly secured and not committed to version control).
                    *   Utilize secure vault solutions for sensitive secrets.
                    *   Avoid logging sensitive environment variables.
                *   **Regularly review application logs and debug settings in production.**

    *   **1.2. Exposed Debug Mode in Production - High-Risk Path:**
        *   **Attack Step:** Access debug pages or error messages revealing sensitive information (path disclosure, configuration details, database errors). - **Critical Node**
            *   **Description:** Leaving debug mode enabled in a production environment is a critical security flaw. Debug pages and detailed error messages can expose:
                *   Application file paths and directory structure (path disclosure).
                *   Configuration details, including database settings and framework versions.
                *   Database error messages that can reveal database schema or query details.
                *   Potentially even source code snippets in some debug configurations.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium -  A common oversight, especially during deployment or if development configurations are accidentally pushed to production.
            *   **Impact:** High - Information disclosure can significantly aid attackers in planning further attacks, identifying vulnerabilities, and potentially gaining direct access to sensitive data or the system.
            *   **Effort:** Low - Trivial to exploit if debug mode is enabled.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low - Requires minimal technical skill.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low - Debug pages are often easily accessible via predictable URLs or by triggering errors.
            *   **Actionable Insight:**
                *   **Strictly disable debug mode in production environments.**
                *   **Implement custom error pages:**
                    *   Ensure custom error pages do not reveal any sensitive information.
                    *   Log errors securely for debugging purposes, but do not display detailed error messages to users.
                *   **Regularly audit production configurations to verify debug mode is disabled.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Known CodeIgniter4 Vulnerabilities - High-Risk Path (for outdated versions)](./attack_tree_paths/known_codeigniter4_vulnerabilities_-_high-risk_path__for_outdated_versions_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities in specific versions of the CodeIgniter4 framework.
*   **Risk Level:** High (for applications using outdated versions), as known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits.
*   **Mitigation Priority:** High, especially for applications not on the latest stable version.

    *   **2.1. Exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific CodeIgniter4 versions (check CVE databases, security advisories). - Critical Node (for outdated versions)**
        *   **Description:**  Like any software, CodeIgniter4 may have publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, remote code execution) in specific versions. Attackers actively search for and exploit these vulnerabilities in applications running outdated versions of the framework. Resources for finding known vulnerabilities include:
            *   CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) databases.
            *   Security advisories from the CodeIgniter4 project or security research communities.
            *   Public exploit databases and security blogs.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (for outdated versions) -  Likelihood increases significantly for applications that are not regularly updated. Attackers actively target known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** High - Exploiting known vulnerabilities can lead to full application compromise, data breaches, remote code execution, and complete system takeover, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on exploit availability) - Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available or relatively easy to develop.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires some understanding of web application vulnerabilities and exploit techniques, but pre-built exploits may lower the skill barrier.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Exploit attempts might be logged, but successful exploitation can be stealthy if not properly monitored.
        *   **Actionable Insight:**
            *   **Regularly update CodeIgniter4 to the latest stable version.**
            *   **Establish a process for monitoring security advisories and vulnerability databases related to CodeIgniter4.**
            *   **Implement a patch management system to quickly apply security updates.**
            *   **Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block exploit attempts against known vulnerabilities (as a temporary measure until patching).**
