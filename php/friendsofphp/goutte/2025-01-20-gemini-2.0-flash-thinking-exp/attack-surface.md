# Attack Surface Analysis for friendsofphp/goutte

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Controlled URLs](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_user-controlled_urls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the target URL used by the application to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.
    *   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte's core functionality is making HTTP requests. If the URL passed to Goutte's request methods (`Client::request()`, `Client::click()`, etc.) is derived from user input without proper validation, it becomes a vector for SSRF.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to provide a website URL to "preview." The application uses Goutte to fetch the content of this URL. An attacker provides an internal IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10/admin`) as the preview URL, potentially accessing internal services.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, ability to interact with internal services, port scanning of internal networks, and potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user-provided URLs against a whitelist of allowed domains or patterns.
        *   **URL Filtering:** Implement a blacklist of internal IP ranges and sensitive hostnames to prevent requests to them.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary network permissions.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the application server from internal networks where possible.
        *   **Regularly Review Code:** Ensure all instances where Goutte makes requests are carefully reviewed for potential user-controlled URLs.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities via Scraped Content (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_via_scraped_content__e_g___cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious code embedded in the scraped content from external websites is executed within the application's context or a user's browser.
    *   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte parses HTML and XML content. If the application renders this scraped content directly without sanitization, any malicious scripts or HTML within the scraped data will be executed. Goutte's methods for extracting specific elements can inadvertently include malicious payloads.
    *   **Example:** An application scrapes product reviews from various websites using Goutte. A malicious actor injects JavaScript into a review on a target website. When the application displays this scraped review, the JavaScript executes in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to a malicious site.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, leading to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and potential data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape all scraped data before rendering it in HTML or using it in other contexts where injection is possible. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   **HTML Sanitization Libraries:** Use robust HTML sanitization libraries (e.g., HTMLPurifier) to remove potentially malicious code from scraped content before displaying it.
        *   **Regularly Review Code:** Identify all places where scraped data is used and ensure proper sanitization is in place.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through Scraped Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_scraped_data.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information scraped from external websites is stored or logged insecurely, making it accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte retrieves the content, including potentially sensitive data. If the application doesn't handle this data securely after scraping, it can lead to exposure.
    *   **Example:** An application scrapes job postings, which may contain salary information or contact details. This data is then logged in plain text or stored in a database without proper encryption, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of personal or confidential information, reputational damage, and potential legal liabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization:** Only scrape the necessary data and avoid collecting sensitive information if it's not required.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Encrypt sensitive scraped data at rest in databases or file systems.
        *   **Redaction in Logs:**  Redact sensitive information from application logs.
        *   **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls to limit who can access the scraped data.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review data handling practices to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Goutte Options](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_goutte_options.md)

*   **Description:** Goutte's configuration options are set in a way that weakens security.
    *   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte provides options that, if misused, can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, disabling SSL verification bypasses security checks.
    *   **Example:** An application disables SSL verification (`$client->disableSSLVerification()`) to interact with a website with an invalid certificate. This makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the communication.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, exposure of sensitive data transmitted over insecure connections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable SSL Verification:** Ensure SSL verification is enabled by default and only disable it in exceptional circumstances with strong justification and alternative security measures.
        *   **Secure Proxy Configuration:** If using proxies, ensure they are reputable and configured securely. Avoid using open or untrusted proxies.
        *   **Review Configuration:** Regularly review Goutte's configuration settings to ensure they align with security best practices.
