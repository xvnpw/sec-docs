# Threat Model Analysis for friendsofphp/goutte

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the target URL used by Goutte to make requests to internal resources or arbitrary external endpoints. This is achieved by influencing the URL parameters or the base URL used in Goutte's client. The attacker might leverage user-controlled input that is not properly validated before being used in Goutte's request functions.

**Impact:** Access to internal services not intended for public access, potential data exfiltration from internal networks, port scanning of internal infrastructure, or using the application as a proxy to attack other external systems.

**Affected Goutte Component:** `Client` component, specifically the functions used to make HTTP requests (e.g., `request`, `get`, `post`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict whitelisting of allowed target domains or URLs.
* Avoid directly using user input to construct target URLs.
* If user input is necessary, thoroughly validate and sanitize it against a predefined set of allowed patterns.
* Consider using a proxy server for outgoing requests to add an extra layer of control and isolation.
* Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF if it occurs.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Requests](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_requests.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently include sensitive information like API keys, credentials, or internal identifiers directly in the Goutte client configuration (e.g., default headers) or when constructing requests. An attacker gaining access to the application's source code or configuration could then extract this information.

**Impact:** Compromise of API keys leading to unauthorized access to external services, exposure of internal credentials allowing attackers to access internal systems, or disclosure of sensitive internal identifiers.

**Affected Goutte Component:** `Client` configuration (e.g., `setDefaultOption`), request building logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the code or configuration files.
* Utilize secure configuration management techniques (e.g., environment variables, secrets management systems).
* Regularly review the Goutte client configuration and request construction logic to ensure no sensitive data is being exposed.
* Implement proper access controls to protect configuration files and source code.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (if parsing XML responses)](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__if_parsing_xml_responses_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Goutte to fetch content from a target that returns XML and then parses this XML without proper configuration, an attacker could manipulate the XML response to include malicious external entity declarations. When parsed, this could lead to the disclosure of local files or internal network resources.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential remote code execution (in certain scenarios depending on the XML processor and system configuration).

**Affected Goutte Component:**  Potentially the underlying HTTP client used by Goutte if it automatically handles XML parsing, or the application's code if it explicitly uses a separate XML parser on the content fetched by Goutte.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the XML parser used (either directly by the application or indirectly by Goutte's underlying components) is configured to disable external entity processing.
* Sanitize or validate XML responses before parsing them.
* If possible, avoid parsing XML content from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Goutte's Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_goutte's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Goutte relies on other libraries (e.g., Symfony components). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect the security of applications using Goutte. An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in a Goutte dependency to compromise the application.

**Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the compromised dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Goutte Component:** Indirectly affects the entire `Client` component and its functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Goutte and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Goutte's dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for Goutte and its dependencies.
