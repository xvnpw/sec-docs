# Attack Surface Analysis for friendsofphp/goutte

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the application to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially targeting internal resources or external services.

**How Goutte Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Goutte's core functionality is to fetch web pages based on provided URLs. If the application allows user-controlled input to determine the target URL for Goutte, it becomes vulnerable to SSRF.

**Example:** An application allows users to import data from a URL. An attacker provides an internal IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10/admin`) as the import URL, potentially accessing internal administration panels.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, launching attacks from the application's server, denial of service to internal services.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs:** Use allow-lists of acceptable domains or IP ranges.
* **Implement URL schema and protocol restrictions:** Only allow `http` or `https`.
* **Prevent resolving to private IP addresses:** Block requests to common private IP ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16).
* **Use a dedicated network segment for Goutte requests:** Isolate the application making Goutte requests to limit the impact of SSRF.

## Attack Surface: [HTML Injection / Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Parsed Content](./attack_surfaces/html_injection__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_parsed_content.md)

**Description:** Malicious scripts embedded in the HTML content fetched by Goutte can be injected into the application's output if not properly sanitized, leading to XSS attacks.

**How Goutte Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Goutte parses HTML content from external sources. If the application directly renders this parsed content without encoding or sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** Goutte fetches a user profile page where the user has inserted a `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` tag in their "about me" section. The application displays this fetched content directly on its own page, executing the script in other users' browsers.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always sanitize and encode output:** Before displaying any content fetched by Goutte, especially user-generated content, use appropriate encoding functions for the output context (e.g., HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping).
* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the impact of injected scripts.
* **Treat all external data as untrusted:** Never assume that content fetched by Goutte is safe.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (if parsing XML)](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__if_parsing_xml_.md)

**Description:** If the target website returns XML and the application uses Goutte to parse it, and the underlying XML parser is not configured securely, attackers can exploit XXE vulnerabilities to access local files or internal network resources.

**How Goutte Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Goutte can be used to fetch and parse XML content. If the underlying XML parser (used by Goutte or the application after fetching) is not secured, it can be vulnerable to XXE.

**Example:** Goutte fetches an XML file from a remote server. The XML contains an external entity definition pointing to a local file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`). The vulnerable parser processes this entity, potentially exposing the file's contents.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, server-side request forgery.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable external entity processing in the XML parser:** Configure the XML parser to disallow the inclusion of external entities.
* **Use secure XML parsing libraries and keep them updated:** Ensure the libraries used for XML parsing are not vulnerable to known XXE attacks.
* **Sanitize XML input (if applicable):** While disabling external entities is the primary defense, consider sanitizing XML input to remove potentially malicious constructs.
