# Threat Model Analysis for friendsofphp/goutte

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unvalidated Redirects](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_unvalidated_redirects.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the target website to issue redirects to internal or sensitive external resources that the application wouldn't normally access directly. Goutte's `Client` component, if configured to automatically follow redirects without proper validation, will make requests to these unintended destinations.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, or the ability to use the application as a proxy to attack other systems.

**Affected Goutte Component:** `Client` (handling redirects).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully control and validate redirects followed by Goutte. Implement a whitelist of allowed redirect destinations.
* Avoid automatically following redirects to arbitrary URLs. Configure Goutte to disable automatic redirects and handle them manually with validation logic.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Goutte's Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_goutte's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Goutte relies on other libraries (e.g., Symfony components). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them through Goutte's usage of these components. This is a direct risk because Goutte integrates and uses these libraries.

**Impact:** Various security issues depending on the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution or data breaches.

**Affected Goutte Component:** Indirectly affects all components as vulnerabilities can reside in any dependency used by Goutte.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Goutte and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
* Use dependency management tools (like Composer) to track and manage dependencies and identify potential vulnerabilities.
* Implement security scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in Goutte's dependencies.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Exposed Request Headers](./threats/information_disclosure_via_exposed_request_headers.md)

**Description:** The application uses Goutte's `Client` to send requests, and inadvertently includes sensitive information (e.g., API keys, authentication tokens) in the request headers. A malicious actor controlling the target website could log or intercept these headers sent by Goutte.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data.

**Affected Goutte Component:** `Client` (setting request headers), `Request` (containing headers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and control all headers added to Goutte requests.
* Avoid including sensitive information directly in request headers if possible. Use more secure methods like encrypted payloads or session cookies managed separately.
* Implement proper logging and monitoring on the target website (if you control it) to detect unusual request patterns, and on your own application to ensure you're not inadvertently sending sensitive data.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Cookies Leading to Session Fixation](./threats/insecure_handling_of_cookies_leading_to_session_fixation.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Goutte's `Client` and `CookieJar` to interact with authenticated areas and doesn't properly manage the cookies obtained, an attacker could potentially fix a user's session by injecting a known session ID into the application's cookie handling mechanism, leveraging cookies initially fetched by Goutte.

**Impact:** Account takeover or unauthorized access to user data.

**Affected Goutte Component:** `Client` (handling cookies), `CookieJar` (managing cookies).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure proper session management within the application, independent of cookies obtained by Goutte.
* Regenerate session IDs after successful login.
* Avoid directly trusting and using session IDs obtained from external websites without careful validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion on Application Server due to Large Responses](./threats/resource_exhaustion_on_application_server_due_to_large_responses.md)

**Description:** A malicious website serves extremely large or complex HTML/XML responses. Goutte's `Crawler` component attempts to parse these responses, potentially consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory) on the application server.

**Impact:** Performance degradation or complete failure of the application server.

**Affected Goutte Component:** `Crawler` (parsing responses), `Response` (handling response data).

**Risk Severity:** Medium (While potentially critical in impact, the direct involvement of Goutte making it exploitable is slightly less direct than the others, but still significant).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts for Goutte requests to prevent indefinitely waiting for responses.
* Limit the size of responses that Goutte will process. Configure Goutte or the underlying HTTP client to limit response body size.
* Consider using streaming or incremental parsing techniques if dealing with potentially very large responses (though Goutte's API might not directly support this).
