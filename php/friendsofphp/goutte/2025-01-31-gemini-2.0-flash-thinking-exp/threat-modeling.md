# Threat Model Analysis for friendsofphp/goutte

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unvalidated Target URLs](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_unvalidated_target_urls.md)

**Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate URLs provided to Goutte's `Client::request()` function if these URLs are not properly validated. By injecting malicious URLs, the attacker can force Goutte to make requests to internal resources, cloud metadata services, or other unintended targets. This allows the attacker to potentially access sensitive internal data or compromise internal services.

**Impact:**

*   Access to sensitive internal data.
*   Compromise of internal services and infrastructure.
*   Potential for further attacks on the internal network.

**Goutte Component Affected:** `Client::request()` function, URL handling within Goutte.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all URLs used by Goutte.
*   Use URL allowlists to restrict Goutte requests to a predefined set of safe domains or URL patterns.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct Goutte request URLs.
*   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Goutte relies on external libraries, including Symfony components and Guzzle. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect applications using Goutte. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Goutte's dependencies to compromise the application if these dependencies are not regularly updated and patched.

**Impact:**

*   Application compromise, potentially leading to remote code execution or data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   Denial of service.
*   Information disclosure.

**Goutte Component Affected:** Goutte library itself and its dependencies (e.g., Guzzle, Symfony components).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update Goutte and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Composer Audit, OWASP Dependency-Check) to automatically identify and report vulnerable dependencies.
*   Implement a vulnerability management process to promptly address and patch identified dependency vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure HTTP Connections](./threats/insecure_http_connections.md)

**Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) via HTTP

**Description:** If Goutte is configured to make requests over insecure HTTP connections instead of HTTPS, the communication between the application and the target website is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Attackers can intercept network traffic, eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted, or even manipulate the data exchanged between the application and the scraped website.

**Impact:**

*   Data interception and eavesdropping, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   Data manipulation and tampering, leading to integrity issues.
*   Credential theft if transmitted over HTTP.

**Goutte Component Affected:** `Client::request()` function, HTTP request configuration within Goutte/Guzzle.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Always configure Goutte to use HTTPS for all requests to ensure encrypted communication.
*   Enforce HTTPS by default in the application's configuration and prevent accidental use of HTTP.
*   Educate developers about the security risks of using HTTP and the importance of HTTPS.

## Threat: [Ignoring SSL Certificate Verification](./threats/ignoring_ssl_certificate_verification.md)

**Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) via SSL Certificate Bypass

**Description:** Disabling or ignoring SSL certificate verification in Goutte's configuration (e.g., setting `verify_peer` to `false`) weakens security significantly. Even when using HTTPS, bypassing certificate verification makes the application highly vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Attackers can easily present fraudulent certificates and intercept communication without Goutte detecting the attack.

**Impact:**

*   Complete compromise of confidentiality and integrity of communication with scraped websites.
*   Data interception, eavesdropping, and manipulation.
*   Potential for credential theft and further attacks.

**Goutte Component Affected:** `Client::request()` function, SSL/TLS configuration within Goutte/Guzzle.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Never disable SSL certificate verification in production environments.**
*   Ensure that SSL certificate verification is always enabled for Goutte requests.
*   Properly configure certificate authorities if necessary to resolve certificate validation issues correctly.
*   Investigate and fix any certificate validation errors instead of bypassing security measures.
*   Use a strong and up-to-date TLS configuration for Goutte and the underlying Guzzle library.
