# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the Goutte library, aims to provide a developer-friendly tool for web scraping and web testing in PHP.

*   Business Priorities and Goals:
    *   Enable automated data extraction from websites for various purposes like data analysis, content aggregation, and market research.
    *   Facilitate automated web application testing, improving software quality and reducing manual testing effort.
    *   Provide a robust and reliable library that simplifies web scraping and testing tasks for PHP developers.
    *   Maintain an open-source project that benefits the PHP community and encourages contributions.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Legal and ethical concerns related to web scraping, including violating website terms of service and robots.txt rules.
    *   Potential for misuse of the library for malicious purposes, such as denial-of-service attacks or unauthorized data collection.
    *   Dependence on external websites, which can change their structure and break scraping scripts, leading to maintenance overhead.
    *   Security vulnerabilities in the library itself or its dependencies, which could be exploited by malicious actors.
    *   Reputational damage if the library is associated with unethical or illegal web scraping activities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: Code review process for contributions (GitHub pull requests). Implemented in: GitHub repository contribution workflow.
    *   security control: Dependency management using Composer. Implemented in: `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files.
    *   security control: Unit testing. Implemented in: `phpunit.xml.dist` and `tests/` directory.
    *   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party dependencies, which may contain vulnerabilities.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the development workflow to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
    *   security control: Consider adding fuzz testing to identify potential input validation issues.
    *   security control: Encourage security vulnerability reporting and establish a process for addressing reported vulnerabilities.

*   Security Requirements:
    *   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, as it's a client-side tool. Authentication is relevant in the context of applications using Goutte when interacting with websites that require authentication.
    *   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Authorization is relevant in the context of applications using Goutte to control access to scraped data and actions performed based on it.
    *   Input Validation: Goutte should handle various types of web content and responses robustly and securely. Input validation is crucial when parsing HTML, XML, and other data formats to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) if scraped data is displayed in a web application. Goutte should also validate URLs and other inputs to prevent issues like server-side request forgery (SSRF) in consuming applications.
    *   Cryptography: Cryptography is relevant when Goutte handles sensitive data during scraping, such as credentials or personal information transmitted over HTTPS. Goutte should correctly handle HTTPS connections and ensure data confidentiality and integrity during transmission. Applications using Goutte might need to encrypt sensitive scraped data at rest.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   For the Goutte library itself, the critical business process is maintaining a secure, reliable, and functional library that meets the needs of its users (PHP developers).
    *   For applications using Goutte, critical business processes depend on the application's purpose. Examples include:
        *   Data collection for market research or business intelligence.
        *   Automated testing of critical web application functionalities.
        *   Content aggregation for content platforms.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   The Goutte library itself does not directly handle sensitive data.
    *   Applications using Goutte may handle data of varying sensitivity depending on the websites being scraped and the application's purpose.
        *   Publicly available website content: Generally low sensitivity.
        *   Personal data scraped from public profiles: Medium sensitivity (depending on regulations like GDPR, CCPA).
        *   Data scraped from authenticated areas or APIs: High sensitivity (credentials, personal information, financial data).
    *   Sensitivity also depends on the context of use. Data aggregated for internal analysis might be less sensitive than data used to make public reports or decisions.
