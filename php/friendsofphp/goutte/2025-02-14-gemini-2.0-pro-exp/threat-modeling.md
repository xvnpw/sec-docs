# Threat Model Analysis for friendsofphp/goutte

## Threat: [Header Manipulation for Spoofing](./threats/header_manipulation_for_spoofing.md)

*   **Threat:** Header Manipulation for Spoofing

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies request headers sent by Goutte (e.g., User-Agent, Referer, custom headers) to impersonate a legitimate browser, a specific user, or a trusted source.  They might try to bypass access controls, trigger different server-side logic, or evade detection mechanisms on the target website. This *directly* uses Goutte's header manipulation capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, triggering unintended actions on the target server, bypassing security measures.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Client::request()`, `Client::setHeader()`, `Client::setHeaders()`, and any methods that allow modification of the `Symfony\Component\BrowserKit\Request` object before it's sent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize any user-supplied data used to construct request headers.
        *   Maintain a whitelist of allowed User-Agent strings and other headers, if feasible.
        *   Avoid directly using user input in headers without thorough sanitization.
        *   Log all outgoing request headers for auditing and anomaly detection.
        *   Consider using a proxy server with header filtering capabilities.

## Threat: [Form Data Tampering](./threats/form_data_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Form Data Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates form data submitted *through* Goutte.  If the application doesn't validate user input *before* passing it to Goutte, the attacker can inject malicious payloads (e.g., XSS, SQL injection) into the form fields. Goutte then sends this tampered data to the target website. This is a *direct* use of Goutte's form submission capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities on the target website, SQL injection on the target website, data corruption, unauthorized actions on the target website.  Crucially, the impact is *on the target*, but Goutte is the vector.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Form::setValues()`, `Form::getValues()`, `Client::submit()`, and any methods interacting with the `Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Form` object.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *before* any data is passed to Goutte for form submission.
        *   Use context-appropriate output encoding on the target website (if you control it) to prevent XSS.
        *   If the target website is under your control, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Treat all data destined for a remote server as potentially malicious.

## Threat: [Information Leakage via Headers](./threats/information_leakage_via_headers.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Leakage via Headers

    *   **Description:** Goutte is configured to send sensitive information (API keys, session tokens, internal data) in request headers.  This information could be logged by the target website, intercepted by a third party, or exposed through error messages. This *directly* involves Goutte's header management.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, data breaches, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Client::setHeader()`, `Client::setHeaders()`, and any methods that modify the `Symfony\Component\BrowserKit\Request` object's headers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and minimize the headers sent by Goutte.  Never send unnecessary headers.
        *   Store sensitive credentials securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets management system).
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the application.
        *   Implement secure error handling to prevent sensitive information from being leaked in error messages.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Scraping and Storage](./threats/sensitive_data_scraping_and_storage.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Scraping and Storage

    *   **Description:** Goutte is used to scrape sensitive data (personal information, financial data, etc.) from a target website.  This data is then stored insecurely, leading to potential data breaches. This *directly* uses Goutte's scraping capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, legal and regulatory penalties.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Client::request()`, `Crawler::filter()`, `Crawler::each()`, and any methods used to extract data from the `Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler` object.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only scrape data that is absolutely necessary and for which you have explicit authorization.
        *   Comply with all applicable data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
        *   Implement strong access controls and encryption for stored data.
        *   Regularly review and delete scraped data that is no longer needed.
        *   Perform a data protection impact assessment (DPIA).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Resource Access (Indirect Privilege Escalation)](./threats/unauthorized_resource_access__indirect_privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Resource Access (Indirect Privilege Escalation)

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in the application *using* Goutte allows a low-privileged user to manipulate Goutte's behavior to access resources or perform actions they shouldn't be able to. This isn't Goutte itself granting privileges, but being the *tool* used in the exploit. While indirect, Goutte's capabilities are *essential* to the attack.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential data breaches, system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** All Goutte components, as the vulnerability lies in how the application *uses* Goutte, not Goutte itself. But Goutte is the *means* of the attack.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict authorization checks *before* any Goutte interaction.  Verify the user has permission for *both* the target resource *and* the action.
        *   Sanitize and validate *all* user inputs that influence Goutte's behavior, even indirectly.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege: users should only have access to the resources they absolutely need.
