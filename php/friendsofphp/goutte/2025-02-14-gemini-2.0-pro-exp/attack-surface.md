# Attack Surface Analysis for friendsofphp/goutte

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Server Responses (HTML Parsing Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_server_responses__html_parsing_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Goutte's HTML parsing logic (or its underlying libraries) through specially crafted responses from a malicious or compromised server.
*   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte fetches and parses HTML from remote servers, making it the direct conduit for this attack.
*   **Example:** A server sends HTML with malformed tags, deeply nested elements, or unusual character encodings designed to trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues in the parsing components.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within your application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update Goutte and all its dependencies (especially Symfony's BrowserKit and DomCrawler) to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation:** Treat *all* data extracted from scraped content as untrusted.  Validate and sanitize even seemingly harmless text.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running scraping processes in a sandboxed or isolated environment (e.g., Docker container, virtual machine) to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Set limits on response size and parsing depth to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirects](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_redirects.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious server redirects Goutte to an internal, non-publicly accessible resource, potentially exposing sensitive data or services.
*   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte follows redirects by default, making it susceptible to being tricked into accessing unintended resources.
*   **Example:** A scraped URL redirects to `http://localhost:8080/admin`, `http://192.168.1.1/config`, or an internal cloud metadata service (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/`).
*   **Impact:** Exposure of internal services, configurations, or data; potential for further exploitation of internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Redirect Control:**  Limit the number of allowed redirects using `setMaxRedirects()`.
    *   **Whitelist:** Implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains or IP addresses for redirects.  *Do not* allow arbitrary redirects.
    *   **Disable Redirects:** If redirects are not essential, disable them entirely.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Ensure your application is running in a network environment where access to internal resources is restricted.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Against Your Application](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__against_your_application.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious server overwhelms your application through Goutte by sending large responses, slow responses, or complex content.
*   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte is the component making the requests and processing the responses, making it the target of the DoS attack.
*   **Example:** A server sends a multi-gigabyte response, keeps connections open for an extended period, or sends deeply nested HTML designed to consume excessive CPU or memory during parsing.
*   **Impact:** Your application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for requests using the `Client::request()` options.
    *   **Response Size Limits:** Implement limits on the maximum size of responses you will accept.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage of your scraping processes.
    *   **Rate Limiting/Circuit Breakers:** Implement rate limiting or circuit breakers to prevent your application from being overwhelmed by requests.
    * **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling to reuse the connections.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** If Goutte is used to scrape and parse XML, a malicious server can inject external entities to access local files or internal resources.
*   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte fetches the XML content, and if the underlying XML parser is misconfigured, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A scraped XML document contains a doctype declaration with an external entity referencing a local file (e.g., `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>`).
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive local files, potential for denial of service, or even remote code execution (depending on the XML parser and system configuration).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable External Entities:** Ensure the XML parser used by Goutte (or any subsequent XML processing) is configured to *disable* external entity resolution. This is a standard security best practice for XML parsing.  Use `libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);` in PHP before parsing any XML.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Requests](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_requests.md)

*   **Description:** Goutte sends HTTP requests that may contain sensitive data (cookies, API keys, etc.), which could be intercepted.
*   **How Goutte Contributes:** Goutte is the component making the requests, and therefore handling the transmission of any sensitive data included in those requests.
*   **Example:** Scraping a site that requires authentication, where Goutte sends cookies or API keys in request headers.
*   **Impact:** Leakage of credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to accounts or services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS Only:** *Always* use HTTPS for all interactions to encrypt the communication channel.
    *   **Secure Credential Storage:** Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
    *   **Minimal Data Transmission:** Only send the minimum necessary data in requests.
    *   **Request Inspection:** Carefully review the headers and body of requests Goutte is making to ensure no unintended sensitive data is being transmitted.
