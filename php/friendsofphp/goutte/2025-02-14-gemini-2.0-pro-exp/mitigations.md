## Mitigation Strategy: [robots.txt Compliance (Goutte Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/robots_txt_compliance__goutte_interaction_.md)

*   **1.  `robots.txt` Compliance (Goutte Interaction)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Fetch `robots.txt` *using Goutte* (or another HTTP client):** Before making any requests to a domain, use Goutte (or another client) to fetch the `robots.txt` file: `$client = new \Goutte\Client(); $crawler = $client->request('GET', 'https://example.com/robots.txt');`.
        2.  **Parse `robots.txt`:** Use a dedicated parsing library.
        3.  **Check Before *Each* Goutte Request:** Before *every* `$client->request()` call, check if the target URL is allowed by the parsed `robots.txt` rules.  This is done *before* you even create the Goutte request.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Legal Action (High Severity):**
        *   **IP Blocking (High Severity):**
        *   **Reputational Damage (Medium Severity):**

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Legal Action:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **IP Blocking:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Reputational Damage:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic `robots.txt` fetching is done, but not consistently before *every* request.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The check needs to be integrated *immediately* before *every* `$client->request()` call.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Rate and Header Management (Goutte Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/request_rate_and_header_management__goutte_configuration_.md)

*   **2.  Request Rate and Header Management (Goutte Configuration)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Delay Between Requests:** After *each* `$client->request()` call, introduce a delay using `sleep()` or a more sophisticated rate-limiting mechanism. This delay should be *after* the response is received.
        2.  **User-Agent Rotation:**
            *   Maintain a list of user-agent strings.
            *   Before *each* `$client->request()` call, randomly select a user-agent from the list.
            *   Set the user-agent using `$client->setHeader('User-Agent', $userAgent);`.
        3.  **Randomize Request Headers:**
            *   Before *each* `$client->request()` call, set other headers like `Accept-Language` and `Referer` to plausible, randomized values. Use `$client->setHeader()`.
        4.  **`Retry-After` Header Handling:**
            *   After *each* `$client->request()` call, check the response status code.
            *   If the status code is 429 or 503, check for the `Retry-After` header: `$retryAfter = $client->getResponse()->getHeader('Retry-After');`.
            *   If the header is present, parse it and wait the specified time before making *any* further requests to that domain.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **IP Blocking (High Severity):**
        *   **CAPTCHA Challenges (Medium Severity):**
        *   **Service Degradation (Low Severity):**

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **IP Blocking:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **CAPTCHA Challenges:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Service Degradation:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   A fixed delay is used, but it's not after *every* request.
        *   A single, hardcoded user-agent is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Random delays need to be implemented *after* each request.
        *   User-agent rotation needs to be implemented using `$client->setHeader()`.
        *   Other header randomization needs to be implemented using `$client->setHeader()`.
        *   `Retry-After` header handling needs to be implemented by checking `$client->getResponse()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Configuration (Goutte Client Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_configuration__goutte_client_settings_.md)

*   **3.  Timeout Configuration (Goutte Client Settings)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Connection Timeout:** Before making requests, set a connection timeout on the Goutte client: `$client->setTimeout(10);` (adjust the value as needed, in seconds). This limits the time Goutte will wait to establish a connection.
        2.  **Request Timeout:** Set a request timeout: `$client->setServerParameter('HTTP_TIMEOUT', 30);` (adjust as needed). This limits the time Goutte will wait to receive the *entire* response.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Application Hangs (High Severity):**  Without timeouts, your application could hang indefinitely waiting for a response.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Hangs:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Timeouts are not configured.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `$client->setTimeout()` and `$client->setServerParameter('HTTP_TIMEOUT', ...)` need to be called during client initialization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling (Goutte Exceptions)](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling__goutte_exceptions_.md)

*   **4.  Error Handling (Goutte Exceptions)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`try...catch` Blocks:** Wrap *every* `$client->request()` call in a `try...catch` block.
        2.  **Catch Specific Exceptions:** Catch exceptions like `GuzzleHttp\Exception\ConnectException` and `GuzzleHttp\Exception\RequestException`.
        3.  **Access Response in `catch`:** Within the `catch` block, you can still access the (potentially incomplete) response using `$client->getResponse()`, even if an exception occurred.  This allows you to log the status code and any response headers, even for failed requests.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Application Crashes (High Severity):**
        *   **Data Loss (Medium Severity):**

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Crashes:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Data Loss:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `try...catch` blocks are used inconsistently.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Every* `$client->request()` call needs to be wrapped in a `try...catch` block.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proxy Configuration (Goutte Client Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/proxy_configuration__goutte_client_settings_.md)

*   **5.  Proxy Configuration (Goutte Client Settings)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Proxy Selection:** Obtain a list of proxy servers and implement a mechanism to select one (e.g., randomly).
        2.  **Goutte Proxy Setting:** Before *each* `$client->request()` call (or when initializing the client), configure Goutte to use the selected proxy: `$client->setClient(new \GuzzleHttp\Client(['proxy' => 'http://username:password@proxy_ip:proxy_port']));` (replace with the actual proxy details, including authentication if needed).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **IP Blocking (High Severity):**
        *   **Rate Limiting Circumvention (Medium Severity):**
        *   **Geolocation Restrictions (Medium Severity):**

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **IP Blocking:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Rate Limiting Circumvention:** Effectiveness depends on proxy quality and quantity.
        *   **Geolocation Restrictions:** Effectiveness depends on proxy location.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No proxy configuration is implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The entire proxy configuration mechanism needs to be implemented, including setting the proxy via `$client->setClient()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Session and Cookie Management (Goutte's Built-in Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/session_and_cookie_management__goutte's_built-in_handling_.md)

*   **6.  Session and Cookie Management (Goutte's Built-in Handling)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Cookie Jar (Verification):** Goutte handles cookies automatically.  *Verify* that this is working as expected (e.g., using a debugging proxy).  There's no specific Goutte method to *enable* it, but you should ensure it's not somehow disabled.
        2.  **Login (Goutte Interaction):** If login is required:
            *   Use `$client->request()` to navigate to the login page.
            *   Use `$crawler->filter()` to find the login form and its fields.
            *   Use `$form->setValues()` to fill in the credentials.
            *   Use `$client->submit($form)` to submit the form.
        3.  **Logout (Goutte Interaction - If Needed):**  Similar to login, use Goutte methods to navigate to the logout page and submit the logout form (if applicable).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Incorrect Data Retrieval (Medium Severity):**
        *   **Account Blocking (Medium Severity):**
        *   **Data Inconsistency (Low Severity):**

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Incorrect Data Retrieval:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Account Blocking:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Data Inconsistency:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Goutte's default cookie handling is assumed to be working.
        *   A basic login implementation exists, but it's not robust.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The login implementation needs to be improved (error handling, CAPTCHA checks).
        *   A logout implementation is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Headless Browser Control (Goutte via Panther - if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/headless_browser_control__goutte_via_panther_-_if_applicable_.md)

*   **7. Headless Browser Control (Goutte via Panther - if applicable)**
    *   **Description:**
        *   This section is only relevant if you are using Goutte *through* Symfony Panther (which uses Goutte internally).
        *   The direct interaction with Goutte is less visible here, as Panther provides a higher-level API. However, the underlying Goutte client is still making the requests.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the *browser process* controlled by Panther. This is done through Panther's client options or the underlying browser's configuration, *not* directly through Goutte methods.
        *   **Header Manipulation:** If you need to modify headers specifically for headless detection, you can still use `$client->setHeader()` *within* Panther, as Panther exposes the underlying Goutte client.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**
        *   **Detection and Blocking (High Severity):**

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced (through Panther/browser configuration).
        *   **Detection and Blocking:** Risk reduced (through header manipulation and other techniques).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No specific resource limits or header manipulation for headless detection.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Resource limits need to be configured (through Panther, not Goutte directly).
        *   Header manipulation (using `$client->setHeader()` within Panther) might be needed for headless detection mitigation.
