# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Mitigation Strategy: [Process Limits using Supervisors](./mitigation_strategies/process_limits_using_supervisors.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify critical supervisors:** Determine which supervisors manage processes that handle external requests or potentially unbounded tasks. These are prime candidates for process limits.
    2.  **Configure `max_children`:**  Within the supervisor definition in your Elixir code (typically in a module defining a supervisor), set the `max_children` option to a sensible limit. This restricts the maximum number of child processes the supervisor will manage concurrently.
    3.  **Choose appropriate `strategy`:** Select a suitable supervision strategy (e.g., `:one_for_one`, `:one_for_all`, `:rest_for_one`).  `:one_for_one` is often a good default, restarting only the failing child process.
    4.  **Monitor supervisor behavior:** Observe the supervisor's performance in production. Adjust `max_children` if needed based on resource usage and application demands.
    5.  **Example (in a supervisor definition):**
        ```elixir
        defmodule MyApp.RequestSupervisor do
          use Supervisor

          def start_link(_arg) do
            Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: __MODULE__)
          end

          @impl true
          def init(:ok) do
            Supervisor.init(children: [
              worker(MyApp.RequestHandler, [], max_restarts: 10, max_seconds: 60) # Example worker
            ], strategy: :one_for_one, max_children: 100) # Limit to 100 request handlers
          end
        end
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Process Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):**  Malicious actors or unexpected application behavior can trigger uncontrolled process creation, exhausting system resources (CPU, memory, process table) and leading to denial of service. Elixir's concurrency model makes it easy to spawn many processes, making it vulnerable if not managed.
    *   **Resource Starvation (Medium Severity):**  Runaway process creation can starve other parts of the application or system of resources, causing performance degradation and instability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Process Exhaustion DoS:**  Significantly reduces the risk. By limiting processes, the application becomes more resilient to attacks or bugs that attempt to overwhelm it with processes, leveraging Elixir's supervisor capabilities for defense.
    *   **Resource Starvation:**  Reduces the risk. Limits prevent a single component from monopolizing resources, ensuring fairer resource allocation within the Elixir application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, partially implemented in `MyApp.Endpoint.Supervisor` to limit HTTP connection processes, demonstrating awareness of Elixir's concurrency implications for resource management.
    *   Yes, implemented in `MyApp.WorkerSupervisor` for background job processing, limiting concurrent workers, showcasing use of Elixir supervisors for controlled concurrency.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing in supervisors handling user-specific resources, such as per-user websocket connections or long-polling processes. These supervisors might need `max_children` configured based on system capacity and expected user load, requiring deeper understanding of Elixir's process model in user-centric contexts.
    *   Review needed for all supervisors to ensure `max_children` is appropriately set and not left at default unlimited values where resource exhaustion is a concern, emphasizing proactive configuration of Elixir supervisors for security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation Before Deserialization (Especially Erlang Term Format)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_before_deserialization__especially_erlang_term_format_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify deserialization points:** Locate all code sections where external data is deserialized, with particular attention to Erlang Term Format (ETF) due to its potential for complex structures and historical vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Define expected data structure:**  Clearly define the expected structure and data types of the data to be deserialized, especially when using ETF where arbitrary Erlang terms can be encoded.
    3.  **Implement validation logic:**  Before deserialization, implement validation logic to check if the incoming data conforms to the expected structure and data types. Utilize Elixir's pattern matching, guards, and custom validation functions to perform these checks *before* using `:erlang.binary_to_term` or similar ETF deserialization functions.
    4.  **Reject invalid data:** If the data fails validation, reject it immediately and log the invalid input for security monitoring. Do not proceed with deserialization of invalid data.
    5.  **Example (basic validation before ETF deserialization):**
        ```elixir
        def handle_external_data(binary_data) do
          case :erlang.binary_to_term(binary_data) do
            {:ok, term} ->
              case validate_deserialized_term(term) do # Custom validation function
                {:ok, validated_term} ->
                  process_valid_term(validated_term)
                {:error, reason} ->
                  Logger.warn("Invalid deserialized data: #{reason}")
                  {:error, :invalid_data}
              end
            {:error, _} ->
              Logger.warn("Deserialization error")
              {:error, :deserialization_error}
          end
        end

        defp validate_deserialized_term(term) do
          if is_map(term) && map_size(term) == 2 && is_atom(term.type) && is_binary(term.payload) do
            {:ok, term}
          else
            {:error, "Invalid term structure"}
          end
        end
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (High to Critical Severity):**  Exploiting deserialization flaws, particularly in ETF due to its power and complexity, can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, bypass security checks, or cause denial of service by crafting malicious serialized data. Severity depends on the specific vulnerability and application context, and ETF's nature increases the potential attack surface if not handled carefully.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  Significantly reduces the risk. Input validation acts as a crucial first line of defense, preventing malicious ETF payloads from reaching the deserialization process and exploiting vulnerabilities inherent in complex serialization formats like ETF.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in API endpoints where JSON data is validated, but explicit validation before ETF deserialization is likely less common and requires more focus due to ETF's specific risks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Missing for internal message handling where Erlang Term Format might be used without explicit validation, assuming internal messages are always trusted (which is a risky assumption, especially with ETF).
    *   Review needed for all data deserialization points, especially those handling data from external or less trusted sources (e.g., message queues, external APIs) where ETF might be used or considered for performance reasons without sufficient security consideration.
    *   Consider developing reusable validation functions or modules specifically for validating ETF structures to promote consistent and secure ETF handling across the Elixir application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Dynamic Code Execution](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_dynamic_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify dynamic code execution points:**  Search your codebase for instances of Elixir functions like `String.to_existing_atom`, `Code.eval_string`, `apply/3` (especially when module or function names are dynamically constructed from user input), and other Elixir features that execute code dynamically.
    2.  **Refactor to use static code:**  Whenever possible, refactor code to avoid dynamic code execution. Leverage Elixir's powerful pattern matching, `case` statements, and function dispatch mechanisms to replace dynamic function calls with static, safer alternatives.
    3.  **Restrict input sources for dynamic execution (if unavoidable):** If dynamic code execution using Elixir features is absolutely necessary, strictly control the sources of input that influence the code to be executed. Limit input to trusted sources and avoid using user-provided data directly in dynamic code constructs.
    4.  **Sanitize inputs (if dynamic execution with external input is unavoidable):** If dynamic code execution with external input is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent code injection. Use whitelisting and escape potentially harmful characters or code constructs before using them in Elixir's dynamic code execution features.
    5.  **Example (avoiding dynamic atom creation in Elixir):**
        **Instead of:**
        ```elixir
        module_name_str = params["module_name"]
        module_atom = String.to_existing_atom(module_name_str) # Potential vulnerability in Elixir
        apply(module_atom, :some_function, []) # Dynamic apply in Elixir
        ```
        **Prefer:**
        ```elixir
        case params["module_name"] do
          "module_a" -> ModuleA.some_function()
          "module_b" -> ModuleB.some_function()
          _ -> {:error, :invalid_module} # Handle invalid input safely using Elixir's case statement
        end
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities (High to Critical Severity):**  Dynamic code execution in Elixir, especially when influenced by user input, can allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary Elixir code on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service. Elixir's features like `String.to_existing_atom` and `apply` become attack vectors if not used securely.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities:**  Significantly reduces the risk. Minimizing dynamic code execution drastically reduces the attack surface for code injection vulnerabilities specific to Elixir's dynamic capabilities. Eliminating dynamic execution entirely removes this class of vulnerability in those areas of the Elixir application.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Generally good practices are followed to avoid `Code.eval_string` in new code.
    *   Usage of `String.to_existing_atom` is reviewed and limited, but might exist in older parts of the codebase, indicating a need for more consistent application of secure Elixir coding practices.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conduct a thorough code audit to identify and eliminate or mitigate all instances of dynamic code execution, especially `String.to_existing_atom` and `apply/3` with dynamic module/function names, focusing on Elixir-specific dynamic features.
    *   Establish Elixir-specific coding guidelines to explicitly discourage dynamic code execution and promote static code alternatives within the Elixir development team.
    *   Implement static analysis tools or linters configured for Elixir to automatically detect potential dynamic code execution patterns during development, leveraging Elixir's tooling for security enforcement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Node Communication with TLS/SSL (Distributed Elixir)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_node_communication_with_tlsssl__distributed_elixir_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate TLS certificates:** Generate TLS/SSL certificates for each Elixir node in your distributed cluster. Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or self-signed certificates for testing/internal environments. This is crucial for securing Elixir's distributed features.
    2.  **Configure Erlang distribution with TLS:** Configure Erlang's distribution mechanism (which underlies Distributed Elixir) to use TLS/SSL for inter-node communication. This typically involves setting Erlang VM arguments or environment variables specific to TLS/SSL configuration for distributed Erlang/Elixir.
    3.  **Verify TLS configuration:**  Test the distributed Elixir setup to ensure nodes are connecting securely over TLS/SSL. Monitor network traffic to confirm encryption is in place for Elixir node communication.
    4.  **Example (Erlang VM arguments - may vary depending on deployment environment and Elixir/Erlang versions):**
        ```bash
        erl -proto_dist inet_tls -ssl_dist_opt certfile=path/to/node.cert,keyfile=path/to/node.key,verify=verify_peer,cacertfile=path/to/ca.cert
        ```
        (Consult Erlang/OTP documentation for precise configuration details and options relevant to your Elixir and Erlang versions.)
    5.  **Rotate certificates regularly:** Implement a process for regularly rotating TLS certificates to maintain security and reduce the impact of potential certificate compromise in your distributed Elixir environment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping on Inter-Node Communication (High Severity):**  Without encryption, network traffic between Elixir nodes in a distributed Elixir system can be intercepted, potentially exposing sensitive data, application secrets, or internal communication details specific to your Elixir application.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):**  Attackers can intercept and manipulate unencrypted communication between Elixir nodes, potentially injecting malicious messages, altering data, or impersonating nodes within your distributed Elixir cluster.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping and MitM Attacks:**  Significantly reduces the risk. TLS/SSL encryption protects data in transit between Elixir nodes, making it extremely difficult for attackers to eavesdrop or tamper with inter-node communication in your distributed Elixir system.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No, currently inter-node communication in the distributed Elixir setup is not encrypted in the staging and production environments, representing a significant security gap in the distributed Elixir infrastructure.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement TLS/SSL encryption for all inter-node communication in staging and production environments for the distributed Elixir application.
    *   Establish a certificate management process specifically for the distributed Elixir environment, covering generation, distribution, and rotation of TLS certificates for Elixir nodes.
    *   Document the TLS configuration and deployment process for the distributed Elixir system, ensuring clear guidelines for secure deployment of distributed Elixir applications.
