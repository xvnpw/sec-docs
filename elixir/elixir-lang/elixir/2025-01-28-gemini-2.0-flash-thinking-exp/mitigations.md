# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in Processes](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_processes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:**  Pinpoint all Elixir processes that receive external input or messages from less trusted processes. This includes web controllers, GenServers handling user data, and processes interacting with external APIs. Focus on message passing boundaries within your Elixir application.
    2.  **Define Input Schemas:** For each input point, define clear schemas or data structures that describe the expected data type, format, and range for messages. Leverage Elixir's typespecs and schemas (e.g., using `Ecto.Schema` or custom schemas) to formally define these expectations for process messages.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic:**  Within each input-handling Elixir process, implement validation logic *before* processing the message. Utilize Elixir's pattern matching and guards in function clauses to filter out invalid messages early in the process logic. Use Elixir functions like `String.valid?`, `Integer.in_range?`, `Enum.member?`, and custom validation functions within your process logic to enforce constraints on incoming messages.
    4.  **Sanitize Input:**  After validation within the Elixir process, sanitize the input message to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or data. For example, when handling user-provided strings that will be displayed on a web page via a process, use HTML escaping functions provided by Phoenix or libraries like `html_entities` *within the process that prepares the data for display*.
    5.  **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling for invalid input messages within Elixir processes.  Return informative error messages to the user or upstream processes, and log validation failures for monitoring and debugging within the Elixir application's logging system. Avoid exposing internal error details that could aid attackers through process communication.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** SQL Injection (if processes interact with databases), Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if process output is used in web contexts without sanitization.
        *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):**  Corrupted data within the Elixir application due to unexpected input formats in process messages leading to incorrect processing.
        *   **Process Crashes (Medium Severity):**  Unexpected input messages causing Elixir processes to crash due to type errors or out-of-range values.
        *   **Business Logic Bypass (Medium Severity):**  Malicious input messages designed to circumvent business rules or access control checks within the Elixir application's process flow.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Injection Attacks:** High reduction in risk if implemented comprehensively across all Elixir process input points.
        *   **Data Integrity Issues:** High reduction in risk, ensuring data consistency and reliability within the Elixir application.
        *   **Process Crashes:** Medium reduction in risk, as validation prevents crashes due to malformed input messages, but other crash causes within Elixir processes may still exist.
        *   **Business Logic Bypass:** Medium reduction in risk, depending on the complexity and coverage of validation rules within Elixir processes.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented in web controllers using Phoenix's `param/2` and `validate_required/3` for basic parameter validation in web request handling processes.
        *   Input validation is present in some GenServers handling user profile updates, using pattern matching and guards within the GenServer process logic.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Missing comprehensive input validation in background worker processes that consume messages from external queues or other Elixir processes.
        *   Lack of consistent sanitization for user-provided content displayed in admin dashboards, especially when data is processed through multiple Elixir processes before reaching the view.
        *   No formal input schemas defined for all critical Elixir processes that handle external or inter-process messages, leading to ad-hoc and potentially incomplete validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Supervision Tree Security and Denial of Service Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/supervision_tree_security_and_denial_of_service_prevention.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Supervisor Strategies:** Examine the restart strategies of all supervisors in your Elixir application's OTP supervision trees. Identify supervisors that might restart child processes too aggressively (e.g., `:one_for_one` with `:temporary` or `:transient` children without backoff) which could be exploited in a DoS attack.
    2.  **Implement Backoff Strategies:**  For supervisors managing Elixir processes that might crash due to external factors or resource limitations, implement backoff strategies within the supervisor definition. Use `:temporary` or `:transient` restart strategies with a `:max_restarts` and `:max_seconds` limit in your supervisor configuration to prevent rapid restart loops. Consider using Elixir libraries like `backoff` for more sophisticated backoff mechanisms within your supervisors.
    3.  **Circuit Breakers:**  For Elixir processes interacting with external services or resources that might become unavailable, implement circuit breaker patterns using Elixir libraries. Use libraries like `circuit_breaker` to prevent cascading failures within your Elixir application and protect it from being overwhelmed by repeated failures in external dependencies.
    4.  **Rate Limiting in Supervisors:**  If a supervisor manages Elixir processes that handle external requests, consider implementing rate limiting within the supervisor itself. This can prevent a single supervisor from being overwhelmed by a flood of requests, even if individual processes are rate-limited, providing an additional layer of DoS protection at the Elixir supervision level.
    5.  **Dynamic Supervisors for Resource Management:**  For scenarios where you need to manage a large number of Elixir processes dynamically (e.g., handling concurrent connections), use dynamic supervisors (`DynamicSupervisor`). This Elixir/OTP feature allows for better resource management and prevents a single supervisor from becoming a bottleneck or point of failure under heavy load, improving resilience against DoS.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Supervisor Exploitation (High Severity):** Attackers intentionally triggering Elixir process crashes to exploit rapid restart loops in OTP supervisors and exhaust server resources.
        *   **Cascading Failures (Medium Severity):**  Failures in one part of the Elixir system propagating to other parts due to uncontrolled restarts and resource exhaustion within the OTP supervision tree.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled Elixir process restarts consuming excessive CPU, memory, or other resources due to supervisor misconfiguration.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS via Supervisor Exploitation:** High reduction in risk by preventing rapid restart loops and resource exhaustion through proper Elixir supervisor configuration.
        *   **Cascading Failures:** Medium to High reduction, depending on the comprehensiveness of circuit breaker implementation within Elixir processes and supervisors.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction, improving resource utilization and preventing resource starvation due to supervisor-related issues in Elixir applications.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic OTP supervision trees are in place for core Elixir application components.
        *   Some supervisors use `:one_for_one` strategy, but without explicit backoff or rate limiting configured in the Elixir supervisor definitions.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No explicit backoff strategies implemented in supervisors managing Elixir processes that interact with external API integrations.
        *   Circuit breakers are not implemented for Elixir processes' interactions with external services.
        *   Rate limiting is not implemented at the Elixir supervisor level.
        *   Dynamic supervisors are not used for managing large numbers of concurrent connections, potentially leading to scalability issues and resource contention under heavy load in Elixir applications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Hex Package Security](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_hex_package_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Dependency Audits:**  Run `mix audit` regularly (e.g., as part of the CI/CD pipeline and periodically during Elixir development) to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies managed by Hex, Elixir's package manager.
    2.  **Pin Dependencies:**  Ensure `mix.lock` file, generated by Elixir's Mix build tool, is committed to version control and used consistently across all environments. This locks down dependency versions from Hex and prevents unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Review Dependency Updates:**  Before updating Elixir dependencies from Hex, carefully review the changelogs and release notes for security-related changes in the updated packages.  Test dependency updates thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production Elixir environments.
    4.  **Minimize Dependencies:**  Reduce the number of Hex dependencies to the minimum necessary in your Elixir project.  Evaluate if functionality provided by a Hex dependency can be implemented in-house with reasonable effort to reduce the attack surface related to third-party Elixir packages.
    5.  **Dependency Scanning in CI/CD:** Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., using GitHub Dependabot, Snyk, or similar) into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect and alert on vulnerable Hex dependencies in your Elixir project.
    6.  **Source Code Review of Critical Dependencies:** For critical Hex dependencies or those with a history of vulnerabilities, consider performing source code reviews of the Elixir package source code to understand their security implications and identify potential issues not yet publicly known.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (High Severity):** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in third-party Elixir libraries (Hex packages) used by the application.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  Compromised or malicious Hex packages introduced into the dependency chain of your Elixir project.
        *   **Dependency Confusion (Medium Severity):**  Accidental or malicious use of private Elixir package names in public Hex repositories.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** High reduction in risk by identifying and patching known vulnerabilities in Hex packages.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Medium reduction, as Hex dependency audits and reviews can help detect suspicious packages, but complete prevention is challenging in the Elixir ecosystem as well.
        *   **Dependency Confusion:** Low to Medium reduction, primarily mitigated by careful Elixir package name management and awareness within the Hex ecosystem.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `mix.lock` is committed to version control for Elixir projects.
        *   `mix audit` is run occasionally during Elixir development, but not integrated into CI/CD.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated Hex dependency audits in CI/CD pipeline for Elixir projects.
        *   Formal process for reviewing and updating Hex dependencies, including security considerations in Elixir development workflow.
        *   No proactive source code review of critical Hex dependencies.
        *   No measures in place to specifically address supply chain attack risks beyond basic Hex dependency auditing for Elixir projects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Serialization and Deserialization Security (ETF and External Formats)](./mitigation_strategies/serialization_and_deserialization_security__etf_and_external_formats_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize ETF Deserialization from Untrusted Sources:**  Avoid directly deserializing Erlang Term Format (ETF) data from external, untrusted sources whenever possible in your Elixir application.  Prefer using standard, well-vetted formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers for external data exchange, especially when security is critical, instead of relying on ETF for external communication.
    2.  **Validate Deserialized Data:**  Regardless of the serialization format used in Elixir, always validate data *after* deserialization.  Do not assume that deserialized data is safe or in the expected format. Apply the same input validation and sanitization principles as described earlier to the deserialized data within your Elixir processes.
    3.  **Use Secure Deserialization Libraries:**  When using external serialization libraries in Elixir, choose well-maintained and reputable libraries that have a good security track record. Keep these libraries updated to patch any known vulnerabilities in your Elixir project's dependencies.
    4.  **Avoid Custom Deserialization Logic for ETF:**  If possible in Elixir, rely on Elixir's built-in ETF deserialization mechanisms. Avoid implementing custom ETF decoding logic, as this can introduce vulnerabilities if not done carefully in your Elixir code.
    5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Phoenix Web Applications:** If using ETF in Phoenix web contexts (e.g., for WebSocket communication), implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS vulnerabilities that might arise from mishandling deserialized data in the browser, especially if ETF data is involved in client-side rendering.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Exploitation of flaws in deserialization logic (including ETF deserialization) to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or gain unauthorized access within your Elixir application.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  If deserialized data (potentially from ETF via WebSockets in Phoenix) is used in web contexts without proper sanitization, leading to XSS attacks in your Phoenix application.
        *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):**  Maliciously crafted serialized data (including ETF) causing data corruption or unexpected application behavior within your Elixir system.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** High reduction in risk by minimizing ETF usage from untrusted sources and validating deserialized data in Elixir.
        *   **XSS:** High reduction in risk in Phoenix web applications by sanitizing deserialized data and implementing CSP, especially if ETF is used in web contexts.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Medium reduction, as validation helps prevent data corruption caused by malicious or malformed serialized data, including ETF data, within Elixir.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   JSON is primarily used for API communication in the Elixir application.
        *   ETF is used for internal Elixir process communication.
        *   Basic validation is performed on JSON request bodies in Phoenix web controllers.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No formal policy on when to use ETF vs. other serialization formats in Elixir, especially for external data handling.
        *   No specific security review of ETF deserialization points in Elixir code, particularly if custom logic is involved.
        *   CSP is not fully implemented in the Phoenix application, which could be relevant if ETF is used in web contexts.
        *   No specific measures to prevent deserialization vulnerabilities beyond general input validation in Elixir processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Phoenix Framework Specific Security Best Practices](./mitigation_strategies/phoenix_framework_specific_security_best_practices.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable CSRF Protection:** Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in your Phoenix application configuration (`config.exs`). Phoenix provides built-in CSRF protection that should be enabled by default in new projects. Verify this setting in your Phoenix configuration.
    2.  **Use Input Validation Helpers:**  Utilize Phoenix's input validation helpers (`param/2`, `validate_required/3`, `validate_format/3`, etc.) in controllers to validate user input received through web requests. Define clear schemas and use `Ecto.Changeset` for robust validation of data coming into your Phoenix controllers.
    3.  **Sanitize Output in Templates:**  Use Phoenix's template engine (EEx) and its automatic HTML escaping features to prevent XSS vulnerabilities in your Phoenix views and templates.  Be mindful of when to use raw output (`<%= raw(...) %>`) and ensure it's only used for trusted content within your Phoenix application.
    4.  **Secure Password Hashing:**  Use `bcrypt_elixir` (or similar secure hashing libraries compatible with Elixir) for password hashing in your Phoenix application.  Never store passwords in plain text. Phoenix libraries like `Pow` provide secure password hashing and authentication features specifically designed for Phoenix.
    5.  **Implement Authorization and Access Control:**  Use Phoenix contexts to encapsulate business logic and enforce authorization rules within your Phoenix application. Implement access control checks at the context level to ensure users only have access to authorized resources and actions in your Phoenix application. Libraries like `Pleroma.ActivityPub.Policy` or custom policy modules can be used for authorization within Phoenix.
    6.  **Keep Phoenix and Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Phoenix and its dependencies (Hex packages) to patch known security vulnerabilities. Follow Phoenix release notes and security advisories for updates relevant to your Elixir Phoenix application.
    7.  **HTTPS Everywhere:**  Enforce HTTPS for all communication with the Phoenix application. Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Caddy) to handle HTTPS and redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS for your Phoenix deployment.
    8.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS and other client-side vulnerabilities in your Phoenix application. Configure your web server or Phoenix application to send appropriate CSP headers for Phoenix responses.
    9.  **Security Headers:**  Configure your web server to send other security-related HTTP headers, such as `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)` for your Phoenix application's web responses.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities to inject malicious scripts into Phoenix web pages.
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (High Severity):**  Attackers performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users in your Phoenix application.
        *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  If database queries in your Phoenix application are not properly parameterized, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities (mitigated indirectly by using Ecto and parameterized queries, but still requires care in Phoenix contexts).
        *   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass (High Severity):**  Weak password hashing, insecure session management, or inadequate access control in Phoenix leading to unauthorized access.
        *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):**  Tricking users into clicking on hidden elements on Phoenix web pages.
        *   **MIME Sniffing Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):**  Browsers misinterpreting file types served by Phoenix, potentially leading to security issues.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** High reduction in risk in Phoenix applications by using template escaping, CSP, and input sanitization.
        *   **CSRF:** High reduction in risk in Phoenix applications by enabling CSRF protection.
        *   **SQL Injection:** High reduction in risk in Phoenix applications when using Ecto and parameterized queries correctly.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:** High reduction in risk in Phoenix applications with secure password hashing and robust access control.
        *   **Clickjacking:** Medium reduction in risk in Phoenix applications by using `X-Frame-Options`.
        *   **MIME Sniffing Vulnerabilities:** Low reduction in risk in Phoenix applications by using `X-Content-Type-Options`.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   CSRF protection is enabled in the Phoenix application.
        *   Phoenix input validation helpers are used in controllers.
        *   HTML escaping is used in Phoenix templates.
        *   `bcrypt_elixir` is used for password hashing via `Pow` in the Phoenix application.
        *   Basic authorization checks are implemented in Phoenix contexts.
        *   HTTPS is enabled in production for the Phoenix application.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   CSP is not fully implemented in the Phoenix application and needs to be strengthened.
        *   Security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, HSTS) are not fully configured in the web server serving the Phoenix application.
        *   Authorization logic in Phoenix contexts needs to be reviewed and strengthened for all critical actions.
        *   Regular security audits of Phoenix-specific configurations and code are not performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Request Throttling for Processes Handling External Requests](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_request_throttling_for_processes_handling_external_requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rate-Limited Endpoints:** Determine which API endpoints or Elixir processes handling external requests are susceptible to abuse or DoS attacks. This typically includes login endpoints, public APIs exposed by your Elixir application, and resource-intensive operations handled by Elixir processes.
    2.  **Choose Rate Limiting Strategy:** Select a rate limiting strategy that suits your needs for your Elixir application. Common strategies include Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket, Fixed Window, and Sliding Window.
    3.  **Implement Rate Limiting Middleware or Logic:** Implement rate limiting using Phoenix middleware (if applicable), custom plugs in Phoenix, or dedicated Elixir rate limiting libraries (e.g., `ex_rated`, `ratex`). Configure the rate limiting logic to apply to the identified endpoints or Elixir processes.
    4.  **Configure Rate Limits:**  Set appropriate rate limits based on your Elixir application's capacity and expected traffic patterns. Start with conservative limits and adjust them based on monitoring and performance testing of your Elixir application.
    5.  **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded Responses:**  Implement proper handling for rate limit exceeded scenarios in your Elixir application. Return informative HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) and include `Retry-After` headers to indicate when clients can retry requests to your Elixir application.
    6.  **Logging and Monitoring of Rate Limiting:**  Log rate limiting events (e.g., rate limit exceeded, requests throttled) for monitoring and analysis within your Elixir application's logging system. Monitor rate limiting effectiveness and adjust limits as needed for your Elixir deployment.
    7.  **Consider Different Rate Limiting Scopes:**  Rate limit based on different scopes relevant to your Elixir application, such as IP address, user ID, API key, or a combination of factors, depending on your application's requirements and user authentication mechanisms.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):**  Overwhelming the Elixir application with a flood of requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  Attempting to guess passwords or API keys by making a large number of requests to your Elixir application.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Malicious or unintentional excessive requests consuming server resources and impacting performance of your Elixir application.
        *   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized or excessive use of public APIs exposed by your Elixir application, potentially leading to cost overruns or service degradation.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS:** High reduction in risk by preventing request floods from overwhelming the Elixir application.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium to High reduction, slowing down brute-force attempts and making them less effective against your Elixir application.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction, preventing resource exhaustion due to excessive requests to your Elixir application.
        *   **API Abuse:** Medium reduction, controlling API usage and preventing abuse of your Elixir application's APIs.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic rate limiting is implemented for login endpoints using a custom plug based on IP address in the Phoenix application.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No rate limiting implemented for public API endpoints exposed by the Elixir application.
        *   Rate limiting is not consistently applied across all relevant endpoints in the Elixir application.
        *   Rate limiting configuration is not easily adjustable and lacks fine-grained control (e.g., different limits for different user roles or API tiers) in the Elixir application.
        *   No monitoring or alerting for rate limiting events within the Elixir application's monitoring system.
