# Threat Model Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Threat: [Process Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/process_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit Elixir's lightweight processes to launch a massive number of processes, overwhelming system resources (memory, CPU). This renders the application unresponsive or crashes the BEAM VM, causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Critical Denial of Service, complete application unavailability.
*   **Affected Elixir Component:** BEAM VM, Process Spawning Mechanisms, Application Supervision Trees.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict rate limiting on process creation at all entry points.
    *   Set hard limits on maximum process count.
    *   Implement robust resource monitoring and alerting.
    *   Utilize backpressure mechanisms (e.g., `GenStage`, `Flow`) to control process creation.
    *   Ensure proper supervision strategies to prevent cascading failures.

## Threat: [Message Queue Flooding (DoS)](./threats/message_queue_flooding__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood critical Elixir process mailboxes with a massive volume of messages. This overwhelms the target process, leading to unresponsiveness or crashes, effectively causing a denial of service for key application functionalities.
*   **Impact:** High Denial of Service for critical features or the entire application, potential process crashes and instability.
*   **Affected Elixir Component:** Elixir Processes, Message Queues, OTP Actors (e.g., `GenServer`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement message queue size limits for critical processes.
    *   Apply rate limiting on message sending to sensitive processes.
    *   Prioritize messages to ensure critical messages are processed under load.
    *   Use backpressure to manage message flow and prevent queue buildup.
    *   Consider circuit breakers to halt message processing during overload.

## Threat: [Concurrency Bugs and Race Conditions (Severe Impact)](./threats/concurrency_bugs_and_race_conditions__severe_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit subtle race conditions in concurrent Elixir code to cause significant harm. This could involve manipulating timing to corrupt data, bypass critical checks (like authentication or authorization), or trigger unexpected and harmful application states.
*   **Impact:** High Data Corruption, Critical Security Bypasses (authentication, authorization), Severe Financial Loss, Major Application Malfunction.
*   **Affected Elixir Component:** Concurrent Code, Shared State (if any), Message Handling Logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly adhere to functional programming principles and minimize shared mutable state.
    *   Forcefully use immutable data structures.
    *   Rigorous design and testing of message passing protocols.
    *   Extensive concurrency testing, including edge cases and failure scenarios.
    *   Static analysis for race condition detection.
    *   Employ robust synchronization mechanisms if shared state is absolutely necessary.

## Threat: [Supervisor Loop Exploitation (DoS, Critical Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/supervisor_loop_exploitation__dos__critical_resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers induce crashes in supervised processes, triggering rapid restarts by misconfigured supervisors. This leads to a resource exhaustion loop, consuming CPU and memory, resulting in a critical denial of service and potentially masking underlying critical failures.
*   **Impact:** High Denial of Service, Critical Resource Exhaustion, Application Crash, Masking of Critical Errors.
*   **Affected Elixir Component:** Supervision Trees, Supervisors, Restart Strategies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design supervision trees with appropriate restart strategies.
    *   Implement exponential backoff for supervisor restarts to prevent rapid loops.
    *   Aggressively monitor supervisor behavior and log restarts for anomaly detection.
    *   Thoroughly investigate and resolve root causes of process crashes, not just rely on restarts.
    *   Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures and supervisor loops.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Erlang/OTP Libraries (Critical Impact)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_erlangotp_libraries__critical_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities in underlying Erlang/OTP libraries are exploited. Since Elixir relies on these libraries, vulnerabilities in areas like parsing, networking, or cryptography directly impact Elixir applications, potentially leading to remote code execution or complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Critical Remote Code Execution, Full System Compromise, Data Breach, Complete Application Takeover.
*   **Affected Elixir Component:** Erlang/OTP Libraries, Dependencies (e.g., `cowboy`, `ssl`, crypto libraries).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandatory and immediate updates of Erlang/OTP and all dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    *   Proactive monitoring of Erlang/OTP security advisories and vulnerability databases.
    *   Automated dependency scanning and vulnerability detection integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Establish incident response plans for rapid patching of critical Erlang/OTP vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (ETF) - Remote Code Execution](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities__etf__-_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send malicious Erlang Term Format (ETF) data to the application, exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities in the Erlang VM or ETF handling libraries. Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution on the server, allowing complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Critical Remote Code Execution, Full System Compromise, Data Breach, Complete Application Takeover.
*   **Affected Elixir Component:** Erlang VM, ETF Deserialization, Network Communication handling ETF.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Absolutely avoid deserializing ETF data from untrusted or external sources.
    *   If ETF deserialization from untrusted sources is unavoidable, implement extremely rigorous validation and sanitization *before* deserialization.
    *   Maintain constant vigilance for and patching of deserialization vulnerabilities in Erlang/OTP.
    *   Prefer safer serialization formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers) for external communication.
    *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization on all external data before any processing.

## Threat: [Macro-based Code Injection (Remote Code Execution)](./threats/macro-based_code_injection__remote_code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code through improperly secured Elixir macros. By manipulating input used in macros for dynamic code generation, attackers can inject arbitrary Elixir code that executes with application privileges, leading to remote code execution and full system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Critical Remote Code Execution, Full System Compromise, Data Breach, Complete Application Takeover.
*   **Affected Elixir Component:** Elixir Macros, Metaprogramming Features, Code Generation Logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Completely avoid using macros to generate code based on *any* untrusted or external input.
    *   If dynamic code generation with macros is absolutely necessary, implement extreme input sanitization and validation, but recognize this is inherently risky.
    *   Extensive and rigorous code review and security audits of all macros, especially those handling external data.
    *   Limit the use of dynamic code generation and explore safer, less dynamic alternatives.
    *   Employ static analysis tools specifically designed to detect code injection risks in metaprogramming.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attacks (High Impact)](./threats/dependency_confusionsupply_chain_attacks__high_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers publish malicious packages to public registries with names that clash with internal or private dependencies. Mix might mistakenly download and use these malicious packages, injecting malicious code into the application build and runtime, leading to potential backdoors, data breaches, or other severe compromises.
