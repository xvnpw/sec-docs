## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **1.1. Dependency Confusion Attack [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   **1.1.1. Introduce Malicious Package with Same Name [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
            *   Attacker publishes a malicious Hex package with the same name as an internal or commonly used package, but on a public repository.
            *   If the application's dependency resolution is misconfigured or doesn't prioritize private repositories correctly, the malicious public package might be installed instead of the intended legitimate one.
            *   The malicious package can contain code to compromise the application during installation or runtime.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or full system compromise.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Utilize private Hex repositories for internal packages.
        *   Strictly verify the origin of all dependencies.
        *   Implement dependency pinning and use lock files (`mix.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.

*   **1.2. Vulnerable Dependency [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   **1.2.1. Exploit Known CVE in Hex Package [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
            *   Attacker identifies known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in outdated or vulnerable Hex packages used by the application.
            *   Exploits for these CVEs are often publicly available or easily developed.
            *   By targeting application endpoints or functionalities that rely on the vulnerable dependency, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Impact varies depending on the specific CVE, but can range from Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), to data breaches and privilege escalation.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regularly audit and update all dependencies to their latest secure versions.
        *   Use vulnerability scanning tools specifically designed for Hex packages.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for Hex packages and Erlang/OTP.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Elixir/BEAM Runtime Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_elixirbeam_runtime_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **2.1. BEAM VM Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **2.1.2. Denial of Service via BEAM Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Attacker crafts malicious inputs or requests designed to consume excessive resources within the Erlang VM (BEAM).
            *   This can include triggering memory leaks, creating a large number of processes (process explosion), or exploiting inefficient algorithms within the application or BEAM itself.
            *   The goal is to overwhelm the BEAM VM, leading to service degradation or complete Denial of Service.
        *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability, potential system instability.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious inputs from reaching resource-intensive parts of the application.
            *   Apply rate limiting to control the number of requests and prevent sudden spikes in resource usage.
            *   Implement resource monitoring to detect and respond to unusual resource consumption patterns.
            *   Utilize proper supervision strategies to handle process failures gracefully and prevent cascading failures.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Concurrency and Process Management Issues [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_concurrency_and_process_management_issues__critical_node_.md)

*   **3.1. Race Conditions in Process Communication [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   **3.1.1. Manipulate Shared State in Concurrent Processes [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
            *   Elixir applications heavily rely on concurrency and message passing between processes.
            *   If process communication and shared state updates are not carefully designed, race conditions can occur.
            *   An attacker can exploit these race conditions by sending carefully timed messages or requests to manipulate shared state in unexpected ways, leading to data corruption, inconsistent application state, or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unexpected behavior, potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized access depending on the affected functionality.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Carefully design process interactions and communication patterns.
        *   Use appropriate concurrency primitives like ETS (Erlang Term Storage), Mnesia (distributed database), or database transactions to manage shared state atomically.
        *   Implement proper locking mechanisms or atomic operations where necessary to ensure data consistency in concurrent environments.

*   **3.1.2. Deadlocks or Livelocks leading to DoS [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   Attacker crafts specific sequences of inputs or interactions that trigger deadlocks or livelocks within the application's process structure.
        *   Deadlocks occur when processes are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other. Livelocks occur when processes are continuously changing state in response to each other, preventing progress.
        *   Both scenarios can lead to a Denial of Service by halting critical application functionalities or the entire application.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability, Denial of Service.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly test concurrent code for potential deadlock and livelock scenarios.
        *   Implement timeouts in process communication to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   Consider deadlock detection mechanisms if feasible for the application's architecture.
        *   Design for resilience and graceful degradation to minimize the impact of concurrency issues.

*   **3.2. Supervisor Tree Exploitation:**
    *   **3.2.1. Trigger Supervisor Restart Loops [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   Elixir applications use supervisor trees to manage process failures and ensure application resilience.
            *   An attacker can craft inputs or actions that cause processes to crash repeatedly in a way that triggers supervisor restart loops.
            *   If the restart strategy is not properly configured or if the underlying issue causing crashes is not resolved, this can lead to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) and ultimately a Denial of Service.
        *   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion, service degradation, Denial of Service.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Design robust error handling within processes to prevent crashes in the first place.
            *   Implement backoff strategies in supervisors to prevent rapid restart loops.
            *   Monitor supervisor behavior and restart patterns to detect potential issues.
            *   Set reasonable restart limits for supervisors to prevent indefinite restart loops.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Error Handling and Logging Issues [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_error_handling_and_logging_issues__critical_node_.md)

*   **5.1. Information Leakage via Error Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   **5.1.1. Expose Sensitive Data in Error Responses [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
            *   Applications might inadvertently include sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, internal file paths, API keys, session tokens) in error messages returned to users or logged in an insecure manner.
            *   Attackers can trigger errors (e.g., by providing invalid input) to elicit these error messages and extract sensitive data.
        *   **5.1.2. Stack Trace Information Disclosure [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
            *   Detailed stack traces, often exposed in error responses or logs, can reveal internal application structure, code paths, and library versions.
            *   This information can aid attackers in understanding the application's internals and identifying potential vulnerabilities for further exploitation.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for further attacks by leveraging leaked credentials or understanding application internals.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement generic, user-friendly error responses that do not reveal sensitive details.
        *   Log detailed error information securely in separate logs with restricted access.
        *   Sanitize error messages before displaying them to users, removing sensitive data.
        *   Configure error reporting in production to minimize stack trace exposure and use error monitoring services that handle stack traces securely.

*   **5.2. Denial of Service via Error Loops [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   Attacker crafts inputs or requests that trigger infinite loops within the application's error handling logic.
        *   For example, an error handler might recursively call itself or repeatedly attempt to process the same invalid input without proper termination conditions.
        *   This can lead to resource exhaustion and a Denial of Service.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability, Denial of Service.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Design robust error handling logic with clear termination conditions to prevent infinite loops.
        *   Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures and error loops.
        *   Monitor error rates and patterns to detect potential error loop scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Misconfiguration and Deployment Issues [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/7__misconfiguration_and_deployment_issues__critical_node_.md)

*   **7.1. Insecure BEAM Node Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **7.1.1. Weak Erlang Cookie [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   In distributed Elixir systems, Erlang cookies are used for authentication between nodes.
            *   If weak or default Erlang cookies are used, or if the cookie is easily accessible, an attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to BEAM nodes.
            *   This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the compromised nodes, take over the application, or disrupt services.
        *   **Impact:** Node takeover, full control over BEAM instance, data breach, service disruption.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Generate strong, unique Erlang cookies for each distributed system.
            *   Securely store and distribute Erlang cookies, restricting access to authorized personnel and systems.
            *   Regularly rotate Erlang cookies.

    *   **7.1.2. Unnecessary Open Ports on BEAM Nodes [HIGH-RISK LEAF NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   BEAM nodes expose various ports for communication, including the Erlang distribution port (default 4369 and range).
            *   If unnecessary ports are left open and accessible from untrusted networks, attackers can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in these services or gain information about the system.
            *   For example, an open distribution port might be vulnerable to exploits or allow unauthorized node connections if not properly secured with cookies and firewalls.
        *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for further exploitation by leveraging open services, unauthorized access to BEAM nodes.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege for port exposure, only opening necessary ports.
            *   Use firewalls to restrict access to BEAM node ports to trusted networks and sources.
            *   Regularly audit open ports on BEAM nodes and close any unnecessary ones.
