# Threat Model Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Threat: [Process Dictionary Abuse](./threats/process_dictionary_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits the use of the process dictionary (using `Process.put/2` and `Process.get/1`) to store sensitive information. If not properly secured, another process (potentially malicious) within the same BEAM instance could read or manipulate this data. This directly involves the `Process` module in Elixir.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, data tampering, or unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the process dictionary.

**Affected Component:** `Elixir.Process` module, specifically `Process.put/2` and `Process.get/1`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing sensitive information in the process dictionary.
* If absolutely necessary, encrypt data before storing it in the process dictionary.
* Carefully control which processes have access to sensitive data.

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Message Passing](./threats/race_conditions_in_message_passing.md)

**Description:** Improperly synchronized access to shared state through asynchronous message passing can lead to race conditions. An attacker could manipulate the timing of messages to cause unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized state changes. This directly involves Elixir's core message passing features.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent state, unauthorized access or modification of data.

**Affected Component:** Elixir's message passing system (`send/2`, `receive/1`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully design state management and message handling logic.
* Use mechanisms like agents or GenServers to serialize access to shared state.
* Employ state machines and well-defined message protocols to avoid ambiguous states.
* Thoroughly test concurrent code for potential race conditions.

## Threat: [Process Impersonation/Spoofing](./threats/process_impersonationspoofing.md)

**Description:** While the BEAM provides process isolation, vulnerabilities in application logic could allow a malicious process (perhaps due to code injection or a compromised dependency) to send messages impersonating a legitimate process. This could trick other processes into performing unauthorized actions. This directly involves Elixir's message passing.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the application.

**Affected Component:** Elixir's message passing system (`send/2`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization within the application's message handling logic.
* Avoid relying solely on process PIDs for authentication.
* Sanitize and validate all incoming messages.

## Threat: [Code Injection through `eval`/`Code.string_to_quoted`/`Code.eval_quoted`](./threats/code_injection_through__eval__code_string_to_quoted__code_eval_quoted_.md)

**Description:** The application uses functions like `eval`, `Code.string_to_quoted`, or `Code.eval_quoted` to dynamically evaluate code based on user input or data from untrusted sources. An attacker can inject malicious code into this input, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. These are core Elixir functions.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including the ability to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, and disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** `Kernel.eval/1`, `Code.string_to_quoted/1`, `Code.eval_quoted/2`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Absolutely avoid** using `eval`, `Code.string_to_quoted`, or `Code.eval_quoted` with user-provided input or data from untrusted sources.
* If dynamic code generation is absolutely necessary, use safer alternatives and carefully sanitize all inputs.

## Threat: [Macro Abuse](./threats/macro_abuse.md)

**Description:** A malicious or poorly written macro, either within the application's code or a dependency, introduces unexpected and potentially harmful code into the application during compilation. This directly involves Elixir's macro system.

**Impact:** Can range from subtle bugs to severe security vulnerabilities, including arbitrary code execution during compilation or runtime.

**Affected Component:** Elixir's macro system (e.g., `defmacro`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review the code of any macros used, especially from external dependencies.
* Use reputable and well-maintained libraries.
* Be cautious when using complex or dynamically generated macros.

## Threat: [Template Injection in EEx (Embedded Elixir)](./threats/template_injection_in_eex__embedded_elixir_.md)

**Description:** The application uses EEx templates to generate dynamic content, and user-provided data is directly embedded into the template without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker can inject malicious code into the input, which will then be executed when the template is rendered. EEx is part of the `elixir` repository.

**Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, information disclosure, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Affected Component:** `EEx` module and related functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before embedding it in EEx templates.
* Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when generating dynamic content involving database interactions.
* Follow secure coding practices for template rendering.

## Threat: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Elixir's built-in serialization mechanisms (e.g., using `:erlang.term_to_binary/1` and `:erlang.binary_to_term/1` directly or indirectly through Elixir code), vulnerabilities in the serialization format or implementation could be exploited. This is especially risky when deserializing data from untrusted sources. While the underlying functions are in Erlang, Elixir code directly uses them.

**Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial-of-service, or other unexpected behavior.

**Affected Component:** While the underlying functions are Erlang (`:erlang.term_to_binary/1`, `:erlang.binary_to_term/1`), their direct use in Elixir code makes this a relevant Elixir threat.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
* If deserialization is necessary, use safer serialization formats and libraries that provide better security guarantees.
* Carefully validate the structure and content of deserialized data.
