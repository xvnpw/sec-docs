## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit BEAM VM Weaknesses -> Process Isolation Bypass -> Exploit vulnerabilities in inter-process communication (e.g., message handling bugs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_beam_vm_weaknesses_-_process_isolation_bypass_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_inter-process_com_9c055713.md)

This path involves identifying and exploiting specific vulnerabilities in how BEAM processes communicate with each other.
An attacker could craft malicious messages that, when processed by a vulnerable process, allow them to escape the intended isolation and potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the target process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit BEAM VM Weaknesses -> Erlang Distribution Vulnerabilities -> Node Takeover -> Exploit insecure cookie management or authentication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_beam_vm_weaknesses_-_erlang_distribution_vulnerabilities_-_node_takeover_-_exploit_insecure__b74c9e00.md)

This path targets applications using Erlang's distribution. If the application uses weak or default "cookies" (authentication tokens) for inter-node communication, an attacker can potentially guess or obtain these cookies and join the cluster as a rogue node.
Once part of the cluster, the attacker can execute commands and potentially compromise other nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit BEAM VM Weaknesses -> Erlang Distribution Vulnerabilities -> Remote Code Execution -> Leverage vulnerabilities in distributed Erlang functions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_beam_vm_weaknesses_-_erlang_distribution_vulnerabilities_-_remote_code_execution_-_leverage__a32da2b0.md)

This path involves finding and exploiting specific vulnerabilities in the functions used for remote procedure calls (RPC) in Erlang's distribution.
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote node within the cluster without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Metaprogramming Features -> Macro Injection -> Inject malicious code via dynamically generated macros](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_metaprogramming_features_-_macro_injection_-_inject_malicious_code_via_dynamically_generated_aa502463.md)

This path targets applications that dynamically generate code using Elixir's macro system.
If user input or external data influences macro expansion without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious Elixir code that gets compiled and executed as part of the application's logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Metaprogramming Features -> Compile-Time Code Execution -> Exploit vulnerabilities in build tools or dependencies to execute code during compilation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_metaprogramming_features_-_compile-time_code_execution_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_build_to_f68d538a.md)

This path focuses on compromising the application's build process.
Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the Mix build tool itself, or in dependencies that execute code during the compilation phase (e.g., through build scripts or code generation hooks). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the final application artifact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Management (Mix) -> Dependency Confusion Attack -> Introduce a malicious package with the same name as an internal dependency](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_management__mix__-_dependency_confusion_attack_-_introduce_a_malicious_package_wi_41baac1f.md)

This path exploits how Elixir's Mix resolves dependencies. If an application uses internal (private) dependencies, an attacker can upload a malicious package with the same name to a public repository (like Hex.pm).
If the application's Mix configuration isn't set up to prioritize internal repositories, it might mistakenly download and use the attacker's malicious package, leading to code execution within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Management (Mix) -> Supply Chain Attack -> Compromise a legitimate dependency to inject malicious code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_management__mix__-_supply_chain_attack_-_compromise_a_legitimate_dependency_to_in_ae53fd9f.md)

This path targets the dependencies that the Elixir application relies on.
If an attacker can compromise a legitimate, trusted dependency (e.g., by gaining access to its repository or developer accounts), they can inject malicious code into that dependency. When the target application updates or installs this compromised dependency, the malicious code is included and executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Management (Mix) -> Vulnerable Dependencies -> Exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party Elixir libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_management__mix__-_vulnerable_dependencies_-_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_thi_f384e987.md)

This is a common attack vector in many software ecosystems. Elixir applications rely on third-party libraries, and these libraries may contain known security vulnerabilities.
If the application uses an outdated version of a library with a known vulnerability, an attacker can exploit that vulnerability to compromise the application. This often involves using publicly available exploits or crafting specific inputs to trigger the vulnerability.
