## Deep Dive Analysis: Code Injection through `eval`/`Code.string_to_quoted`/`Code.eval_quoted` in Elixir

This analysis provides a comprehensive look at the threat of code injection through the use of `Kernel.eval/1`, `Code.string_to_quoted/1`, and `Code.eval_quoted/2` in an Elixir application. We will dissect the threat, explore its mechanics, assess the impact, and detail robust mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Overview:**

The core of this threat lies in the dynamic execution of Elixir code provided by an untrusted source. Elixir, like many dynamic languages, offers powerful introspection and metaprogramming capabilities. Functions like `eval`, `Code.string_to_quoted`, and `Code.eval_quoted` are designed to convert strings into executable code at runtime. While these functions are valuable for certain advanced use cases (e.g., building DSLs, metaprogramming), their misuse with untrusted input creates a significant security vulnerability.

**2. Detailed Explanation of the Threat:**

Imagine an Elixir application that takes user input, perhaps through a web form or an API endpoint, and uses this input directly within one of the vulnerable functions. An attacker can craft malicious Elixir code within this input. When the application executes this code, the attacker gains control over the application's execution environment.

**Here's a breakdown of how each function can be exploited:**

* **`Kernel.eval/1`:** This function directly evaluates a string as Elixir code. If a user-controlled string is passed to `eval`, the attacker's code will be executed with the privileges of the application.

   ```elixir
   # Vulnerable Example
   user_input = "IO.puts(\"Hello from the attacker!\")"
   eval(user_input) # Executes the attacker's code
   ```

* **`Code.string_to_quoted/1`:** This function parses a string and returns its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation as an Elixir term (a quoted expression). While it doesn't directly execute code, it's a crucial step for `Code.eval_quoted`. If an attacker can control the input to `string_to_quoted`, they can craft malicious AST structures.

   ```elixir
   # Vulnerable Example
   user_input = "quote do: System.cmd(\"rm\", [\"-rf\", \"/\"]) end"
   quoted_expression = Code.string_to_quoted(user_input)
   # The attacker has crafted a malicious AST
   ```

* **`Code.eval_quoted/2`:** This function takes a quoted expression (typically generated by `string_to_quoted`) and evaluates it. If the quoted expression originates from untrusted input, `eval_quoted` will execute the attacker's malicious code.

   ```elixir
   # Vulnerable Example (building on the previous example)
   user_input = "quote do: System.cmd(\"rm\", [\"-rf\", \"/\"]) end"
   quoted_expression = Code.string_to_quoted(user_input)
   case quoted_expression do
     {:ok, ast, _} -> Code.eval_quoted(ast) # Executes the attacker's code
     {:error, _, _} -> IO.puts("Invalid code")
   end
   ```

**3. How the Attack Works (Technical Details):**

The attack typically follows these steps:

1. **Identify Vulnerable Input:** The attacker identifies an input vector where the application uses one of the vulnerable functions with data potentially influenced by the attacker. This could be a web form field, API parameter, data from a database controlled by the attacker, or even a configuration file if it's processed dynamically.

2. **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious Elixir code snippet or AST representation. This payload can perform various actions, such as:
    * **Remote Code Execution:** Execute arbitrary system commands using `System.cmd/3`.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Read sensitive data from the application's database, environment variables, or file system.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crash the application or consume excessive resources.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gain access to resources or functionalities beyond the application's intended scope.
    * **Lateral Movement:** If the application interacts with other systems, the attacker might use the compromised application as a stepping stone.

3. **Inject Payload:** The attacker injects the crafted payload into the identified input vector.

4. **Execution:** The application processes the input and passes it to `eval`, `string_to_quoted`, or `eval_quoted`. The malicious code is then executed within the application's context.

**4. Real-World Examples (Illustrative):**

While directly using `eval` with user input is a well-known anti-pattern, subtle variations can introduce vulnerabilities:

* **Dynamic Rule Engines:** An application might allow users to define custom rules using a string-based syntax, which is then converted to Elixir code using `string_to_quoted` and `eval_quoted`. If not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious rules.

* **Configuration from External Sources:** An application might load configuration from a database or external file where some values are treated as Elixir code to be evaluated. If an attacker can manipulate this configuration, they can inject malicious code.

* **Dynamic Form Processing:**  A system that dynamically generates and processes forms might use `eval` to handle custom logic defined within the form structure.

**5. Deeper Dive into the Vulnerable Functions:**

* **`Kernel.eval/1`:** This is the most direct and dangerous function. It takes a string and executes it as Elixir code within the current scope. There is no inherent safety mechanism.

* **`Code.string_to_quoted/1`:** While not directly executing code, it's the gateway to `eval_quoted`. It parses a string into Elixir's internal representation. The complexity of Elixir's syntax makes it challenging to perfectly sanitize input before passing it to this function. Even seemingly harmless input can be crafted to produce malicious AST when combined with other code.

* **`Code.eval_quoted/2`:** This function evaluates a quoted expression. Its safety depends entirely on the source and integrity of the quoted expression. If the AST has been tampered with or originates from untrusted input, `eval_quoted` will execute the malicious logic.

**6. Impact Assessment (Expanding on the Initial Description):**

The impact of successful code injection through these functions is severe and far-reaching:

* **Complete Server Compromise:** As stated, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server. This means they can:
    * **Access and Modify Sensitive Data:** Read database credentials, API keys, user data, financial information, etc.
    * **Install Malware:** Deploy backdoors, keyloggers, or other malicious software.
    * **Disrupt Services:** Shut down the application, delete critical files, or launch denial-of-service attacks against other systems.
    * **Take Over the Server:** Potentially gain root access, depending on the application's privileges.

* **Data Breach:**  Compromised data can lead to significant financial losses, legal repercussions, and reputational damage.

* **Reputational Damage:**  News of a successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the compromised application is part of a larger system or interacts with other applications, the attacker might be able to use it as a stepping stone to compromise other systems.

* **Financial Losses:**  Incident response, recovery efforts, legal fees, and potential fines can result in significant financial losses.

**7. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed):**

The primary mitigation strategy is to **absolutely avoid** using `eval`, `Code.string_to_quoted`, or `Code.eval_quoted` with user-provided input or data from untrusted sources. This is not just a recommendation; it's a fundamental security principle.

If dynamic code generation is absolutely necessary, consider these safer alternatives and implement robust sanitization measures:

* **Predefined Logic and Configuration:**  Design your application to handle different scenarios through predefined logic and configuration options. Avoid allowing users to provide arbitrary code.

* **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs):** If you need to allow users to define custom logic, create a restricted DSL with a limited set of safe operations. Parse and interpret the DSL instead of directly evaluating it as Elixir code. Tools like `Yecc` or `Leex` can be helpful for building parsers.

* **Sandboxing and Isolation:** If dynamic code execution is unavoidable, consider using a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions. Elixir's lightweight processes can offer some isolation, but true sandboxing might require leveraging operating system-level features or specialized libraries. However, even with sandboxing, the complexity of Elixir's runtime makes it difficult to guarantee complete isolation.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Even for Alternatives):**  Even if you're using safer alternatives, rigorously validate and sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks within the context of your chosen approach. For DSLs, ensure the parser correctly handles potentially malicious input.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run your Elixir application with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can cause even if they manage to execute code.

* **Code Review and Static Analysis:** Regularly review your code for instances of these vulnerable functions and ensure that they are not used with untrusted input. Static analysis tools can help automate this process.

**8. Detection Strategies:**

Identifying potential vulnerabilities related to these functions requires a multi-pronged approach:

* **Code Audits:** Manually review the codebase, specifically looking for instances of `eval`, `Code.string_to_quoted`, and `Code.eval_quoted`. Pay close attention to how the arguments for these functions are constructed.

* **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools designed for Elixir (e.g., Credo with custom checks) to automatically identify potential uses of these functions with untrusted input.

* **Dynamic Analysis and Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify if an attacker can inject malicious code through these functions.

* **Runtime Monitoring (with Caution):** While difficult, you could potentially monitor the arguments passed to these functions at runtime in a development or staging environment to identify unexpected or suspicious input. However, this approach can be resource-intensive and may not catch all vulnerabilities.

**9. Prevention Best Practices:**

Beyond specific mitigation strategies, adopting general secure development practices is crucial:

* **Security Awareness Training:** Ensure developers understand the risks associated with code injection and the dangers of using dynamic evaluation functions with untrusted input.

* **Secure Coding Practices:** Implement secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle.

* **Regular Security Updates:** Keep your Elixir, Erlang/OTP, and all dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.

* **Input Validation Everywhere:** Validate all user inputs, regardless of the source, to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious code.

* **Output Encoding:** When displaying user-generated content, properly encode it to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can sometimes be a precursor to code injection.

**10. Conclusion:**

The threat of code injection through `eval`, `Code.string_to_quoted`, and `Code.eval_quoted` in Elixir applications is a critical security concern. These powerful functions, while useful in specific scenarios, pose a significant risk when used with untrusted input. The potential impact of exploitation is severe, ranging from data breaches to complete server compromise.

The most effective mitigation strategy is to **avoid using these functions with untrusted input altogether.**  If dynamic code generation is absolutely necessary, explore safer alternatives like DSLs or sandboxing, and implement robust input validation and sanitization. A proactive approach to security, including code reviews, static analysis, and security awareness training, is essential to prevent this dangerous vulnerability from being introduced into your Elixir applications.
