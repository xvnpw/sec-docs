**Subject:** Deep Dive Analysis: EEx Template Injection Vulnerability

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the identified threat: **Template Injection in EEx (Embedded Elixir)**. We will delve into the mechanics of this vulnerability, its potential impact, specific exploitation scenarios within the Elixir/EEx context, and detailed recommendations for prevention and detection.

**1. Understanding Template Injection**

Template injection is a server-side vulnerability that arises when user-provided data is directly embedded into a template engine's code without proper sanitization or escaping. Template engines, like EEx in Elixir, are designed to generate dynamic output by combining static templates with dynamic data. When attackers can control the data being inserted, they can manipulate the template logic itself, leading to unintended code execution.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Templates:** Files containing static content with placeholders or directives for dynamic data. In EEx, these are often `.eex` files.
* **Template Engine (EEx):**  The software responsible for parsing the template and replacing placeholders with actual data.
* **User-Provided Data:** Any data originating from outside the application's trusted environment, such as user input from forms, URLs, APIs, or databases.
* **Sanitization:** The process of removing potentially harmful characters or code from user input.
* **Escaping:** The process of converting special characters into their safe equivalents, preventing them from being interpreted as code.

**2. EEx Specifics and Vulnerability Points**

EEx (Embedded Elixir) is Elixir's built-in templating engine. It uses special tags to embed Elixir code within HTML or other text-based formats. The primary tags of concern for template injection are:

* **`<%= expression %>`:** Evaluates the Elixir expression and outputs the result. This is the most common vector for template injection. If `expression` contains unsanitized user input, it will be executed as Elixir code.
* **`<%- expression %>`:** Similar to `<%= expression %>`, but it trims leading and trailing whitespace from the output. Still vulnerable to injection.

**Why is EEx vulnerable?**

EEx, by design, executes the code within its tags. If the content within these tags originates from an untrusted source without proper sanitization, the template engine will interpret and execute it as legitimate Elixir code.

**Example of Vulnerable Code:**

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.PageController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller

  def vulnerable_greeting(conn, %{"name" => name}) do
    render(conn, :greeting, name: name)
  end
end
```

**`greeting.html.eex`:**

```html
<h1>Hello, <%= @name %>!</h1>
```

If a user sends a request like `/?name=<%= System.cmd("rm", ["-rf", "/tmp/important_files"]) %>`, the EEx engine will execute the `System.cmd` function, potentially deleting critical files on the server.

**3. Impact Analysis: Delving Deeper**

The impact of EEx template injection can be severe and multifaceted:

* **Arbitrary Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical impact. Attackers can execute arbitrary Elixir code on the server, allowing them to:
    * **Gain complete control of the server:** Install malware, create backdoors, manipulate system configurations.
    * **Access sensitive data:** Read files, environment variables, database credentials.
    * **Disrupt services:** Crash the application, overload resources.
* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can inject code to access and exfiltrate sensitive information, even if they don't gain full RCE. This could involve reading database records, accessing internal application state, or revealing configuration details.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While template injection is a server-side vulnerability, it can be leveraged to inject malicious client-side scripts. By injecting JavaScript code into the template, attackers can:
    * **Steal user credentials:** Capture login details, session tokens.
    * **Perform actions on behalf of users:** Submit forms, make purchases, change account settings.
    * **Redirect users to malicious websites.**
    * **Deface the application.**
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** In certain scenarios, attackers might be able to manipulate the template to make the server send requests to internal or external resources, potentially bypassing firewalls or accessing internal services.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting resource-intensive code, attackers could potentially overload the server and cause a denial of service.

**4. Detailed Exploitation Scenarios in Elixir/EEx Context**

Let's explore specific ways an attacker might exploit this vulnerability in an Elixir application using EEx:

* **Direct Code Execution:** As shown in the earlier example, injecting Elixir functions directly within `<%= ... %>` can lead to immediate code execution. This could involve using modules like `System`, `File`, `Erlang`, or any other accessible module.
* **Accessing Application State:** Attackers might try to access application variables or data structures within the template context. While Elixir's immutability provides some protection, access to certain data could still be harmful.
* **Manipulating Database Interactions (If Improperly Handled):** If the template directly constructs database queries using user input (without parameterized queries), attackers can inject malicious SQL statements (SQL injection) through the template.
* **Exploiting Libraries and Dependencies:** If the application uses external libraries, attackers might try to inject code that interacts with these libraries in unintended ways, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities within those libraries.
* **Environment Variable Access:** Attackers could inject code to read environment variables, which often contain sensitive information like API keys or database credentials. Example: `<%= System.get_env("DATABASE_URL") %>`.
* **File System Manipulation:**  Injecting code to read, write, or delete files on the server's file system. Example: `<%= File.read!("config/secrets.exs") %>`.

**5. Prevention Strategies: A Deeper Dive**

The mitigation strategies mentioned earlier are crucial. Let's elaborate on them with Elixir-specific considerations:

* **Always Sanitize and Escape User-Provided Data:** This is the **most critical** step.
    * **Context-Aware Escaping:**  The escaping mechanism should be appropriate for the output context (HTML, JavaScript, URL, etc.). For HTML, use `Phoenix.HTML.Tag.escape/1`.
    * **Avoid Raw Output:**  Be extremely cautious with functions like `raw/1` in Phoenix templates. Only use them when you are absolutely sure the content is safe and has been properly sanitized.
    * **Sanitize on Input:**  Consider sanitizing user input as early as possible in the application lifecycle, preferably during data validation.
* **Use Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements:** This is essential when dealing with database interactions. Elixir libraries like `Ecto` provide robust mechanisms for parameterized queries, preventing SQL injection. **Never construct SQL queries by directly concatenating user input.**
* **Follow Secure Coding Practices for Template Rendering:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of a successful attack.
    * **Input Validation:**  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and constraints. This can prevent unexpected data from reaching the template.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks even if template injection occurs.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Elixir, Erlang, Phoenix, and all other dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Consider Using a Templating Engine with Auto-Escaping (with Caution):** While EEx doesn't have automatic escaping by default, some alternative templating libraries might offer this feature. However, relying solely on auto-escaping can be risky if not fully understood and configured correctly.

**6. Detection Strategies: Identifying the Vulnerability**

Proactive detection is crucial to address template injection vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

* **Code Reviews:**  Manually inspect the codebase, paying close attention to how user input is used within EEx templates. Look for instances where user-provided data is directly embedded within `<%= ... %>` without proper escaping.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools:** Utilize SAST tools that can analyze the source code and identify potential template injection vulnerabilities. Some tools might have specific rules for EEx.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools:** Employ DAST tools to test the running application by sending malicious payloads and observing the responses. These tools can simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities that might not be apparent during code review.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage experienced security professionals to conduct penetration testing. They can use manual techniques and specialized tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including template injection.
* **Security Audits:**  Regular security audits should include a focus on template handling and input sanitization practices.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** While not a primary prevention mechanism for template injection, a WAF can help detect and block malicious requests that might be attempting to exploit this vulnerability. Configure the WAF with rules that look for common template injection payloads.
* **Runtime Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity, such as unusual code execution or access to sensitive resources.

**7. Collaboration with the Development Team**

As a cybersecurity expert, effective collaboration with the development team is paramount.

* **Educate Developers:** Provide training on common web application vulnerabilities, including template injection, and secure coding practices for Elixir and EEx.
* **Establish Secure Development Guidelines:**  Work with the team to establish clear guidelines for handling user input and rendering templates securely.
* **Code Review and Pair Programming:** Participate in code reviews to identify potential security flaws early in the development process. Encourage pair programming on security-sensitive components.
* **Security Champions:** Identify and empower security champions within the development team to promote secure coding practices and act as a point of contact for security-related questions.
* **Incident Response Plan:**  Collaborate on developing an incident response plan to address security vulnerabilities effectively if they are discovered.
