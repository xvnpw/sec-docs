# Attack Surface Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions in Concurrent Processes](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_concurrent_processes.md)

* **Description:** When multiple Elixir processes access and modify shared resources or state concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable and potentially exploitable outcomes.
    * **How Elixir Contributes:** Elixir's actor model inherently promotes concurrency. If shared state is not managed with concurrency in mind, race conditions can arise due to the lightweight nature and ease of spawning processes.
    * **Example:** Two concurrent processes attempting to update the same piece of application state (e.g., using an `Agent` without proper synchronization), leading to data corruption or inconsistent application behavior that can be exploited.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for privilege escalation depending on the affected data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize mechanisms like `Agent`, `GenServer` with explicit state management and controlled access patterns.
        * Employ message passing for state updates to enforce sequential processing of state changes.
        * Thoroughly test concurrent code paths, including edge cases and potential race conditions.
        * Consider using libraries or patterns that provide higher-level concurrency abstractions and safety guarantees.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

* **Description:** Deserializing data from untrusted sources using Elixir's built-in mechanisms or external libraries can lead to arbitrary code execution if the data is maliciously crafted.
    * **How Elixir Contributes:** Elixir's `Marshal` module (though less commonly used for external data) can be a vector if employed for handling untrusted input. The potential for integrating with libraries that perform deserialization also exists.
    * **Example:** An application receives serialized data from a user-controlled source and uses `Marshal.from_binary/1` (or a similar function from a third-party library) to deserialize it. A malicious payload within the serialized data could execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid deserializing untrusted data entirely whenever feasible.**
        * If deserialization is absolutely necessary, prefer well-established and secure formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers with strict schema validation enforced by Elixir code.
        * Sanitize and validate all deserialized data thoroughly before using it within the application logic.
        * Consider using isolated environments or sandboxing for deserialization processes.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution via Dynamic Code Evaluation](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution_via_dynamic_code_evaluation.md)

* **Description:** Using Elixir functions like `eval` or `Code.require_file` with user-controlled input allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **How Elixir Contributes:** Elixir's powerful metaprogramming capabilities, including dynamic code evaluation, are a direct contributor to this attack surface when used without strict control over the input.
    * **Example:** An application takes a code snippet as input from a user (e.g., via a web form or API) and executes it using `eval/1`. A malicious user could inject arbitrary Elixir code to compromise the system.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never use `eval` or similar dynamic code evaluation functions with any form of user-controlled input.**
        * If dynamic code loading is required for specific functionalities, restrict the source paths from which code can be loaded and implement rigorous validation and sanitization of any input involved in the loading process.
        * Explore alternative architectural patterns that avoid the need for dynamic code execution, such as using predefined functions, configuration files, or plugin systems with clearly defined interfaces.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Elixir projects rely on external libraries managed by `Mix`. Vulnerabilities within these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    * **How Elixir Contributes:** Elixir's dependency management system (`Mix`) is central to building applications, and the inclusion of vulnerable dependencies directly introduces risk into the Elixir application.
    * **Example:** A widely used Elixir library has a security vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. An application using this vulnerable library is susceptible to this attack.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a robust dependency management strategy that includes regular auditing and updating of dependencies to their latest secure versions.
        * Utilize tools like `mix audit` to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        * Carefully evaluate the security and trustworthiness of new dependencies before incorporating them into the project.
        * Consider using dependency management tools that offer security scanning and vulnerability alerting features.
        * Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) practices.
