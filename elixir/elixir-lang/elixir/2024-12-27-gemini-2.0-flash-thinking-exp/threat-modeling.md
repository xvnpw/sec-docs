## High and Critical Elixir-Specific Threats

This table outlines high and critical security threats that directly involve the Elixir programming language itself.

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Elixir Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Message Injection/Spoofing** | An attacker crafts and sends malicious messages to Elixir processes (Actors/GenServers) impersonating legitimate senders or containing harmful data. This could lead to unauthorized state changes, data manipulation, or triggering unintended actions within the Elixir application logic. |  **Integrity:** Compromised process state, incorrect data. **Availability:** Process crashes, denial of service if the process is critical. **Confidentiality:** Potential disclosure of sensitive information if the process handles it. | `GenServer`, `Agent`, `Task`, `send/2`, `receive/1`, `handle_cast/2`, `handle_call/3`, `handle_info/2` | **High** | - Implement robust message validation and sanitization within process handlers. - Use unique identifiers or tokens within messages to verify origin and integrity. - Consider using OTP's `:pg` (process groups) for controlled communication between related processes. - Employ encryption for sensitive data within messages. |
| **Resource Exhaustion through Uncontrolled Process Creation** | An attacker sends a flood of requests or triggers actions that cause the application to spawn an excessive number of Elixir processes using Elixir's concurrency primitives, consuming system resources (CPU, memory) and leading to a denial of service. | **Availability:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion. | `spawn/1`, `spawn_link/1`, `Task.start_link/1`, supervision trees if not properly configured | **High** | - Implement rate limiting and request throttling at the application entry points. - Use supervision trees to monitor and restart failing processes, preventing cascading failures, and potentially implement dynamic supervisor strategies. - Set limits on the number of concurrent processes that can be spawned based on available resources. - Employ backpressure mechanisms to handle surges in requests. |
| **Code Injection through Macro Misuse** | Elixir's powerful metaprogramming capabilities, particularly macros, can be misused to inject malicious code at compile time if user input or untrusted data is directly incorporated into macro definitions or expansions. This allows for arbitrary code execution within the Elixir application. | **Confidentiality:** Exposure of secrets, unauthorized access. **Integrity:** Code manipulation, arbitrary code execution. **Availability:** Denial of service, potential for complete application takeover. | Macros (`defmacro`), `quote/1`, `unquote/1`, compile-time code generation | **High** | - **Strongly avoid** using user input or untrusted data directly within macro definitions or expansions. - Sanitize and validate any data used within macros with extreme caution. - Carefully review the code of any third-party macros before using them. Consider the security implications of any compile-time code generation. |
