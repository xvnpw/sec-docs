# Threat Model Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Threat: [Race Condition in Message Handling](./threats/race_condition_in_message_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the timing of messages sent to an Elixir process to exploit a race condition. This might involve sending messages in an unexpected order or sending multiple messages concurrently to trigger a vulnerable state within the Elixir process's logic.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption within the process's state, inconsistent application behavior leading to incorrect outputs or unauthorized actions, or denial of service if the race condition leads to a process crash.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific Elixir modules or functions that manage shared state and rely on the order of message processing within a process or between processes using Elixir's message passing primitives (e.g., `send/2`, `receive/1`, `GenServer.handle_info/2`, `GenServer.handle_call/3`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement proper synchronization mechanisms when accessing and modifying shared state within an Elixir process. Consider using techniques like message queue ordering guarantees (where applicable), state management libraries with built-in concurrency control, or explicit locking mechanisms if absolutely necessary.
    *   Design Elixir process logic to be as stateless as possible or to handle concurrent updates gracefully.
    *   Thoroughly test concurrent code paths using Elixir's concurrency features to identify and address potential race conditions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Process Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_process_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send a large number of malicious or crafted messages to an Elixir application, specifically targeting the mechanisms that spawn new Elixir processes. This could lead to the uncontrolled creation of processes, exhausting system resources (CPU, memory, process IDs) and causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** The Elixir application becomes unresponsive, crashes due to resource exhaustion, or consumes excessive resources, potentially impacting other services on the same system.
*   **Affected Component:** Elixir functions and constructs used for process creation, such as `spawn/1`, `spawn_link/1`, `Task.start_link/1`, `Supervisor.start_child/2`, or custom process spawning logic within Elixir OTP applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on incoming requests or messages that trigger process creation.
    *   Set appropriate limits on the number of child processes a Supervisor can spawn using its configuration options.
    *   Use backpressure mechanisms or queueing to manage bursts of incoming requests that might lead to excessive process creation.
    *   Monitor system resources and Elixir application metrics (e.g., number of processes) to detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Code Injection through Unsanitized Macro Inputs](./threats/code_injection_through_unsanitized_macro_inputs.md)

*   **Description:** If an Elixir macro is designed in a way that it directly incorporates external, untrusted input (e.g., configuration values, environment variables) into the code it generates without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker could inject malicious Elixir code. This injected code would then be executed during the compilation process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during the compilation phase, potentially compromising the build environment, injecting malicious code into the final application artifact, or revealing sensitive information present during compilation.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific macro definitions within the Elixir application or its dependencies that process external input and generate Elixir code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly embedding external, untrusted input into macro-generated code.
    *   If external input is absolutely necessary within a macro, rigorously sanitize and validate it to ensure it cannot be interpreted as executable Elixir code.
    *   Treat macro code with the same level of security scrutiny as runtime code, as it can have significant impact during the build process. Consider using safer alternatives to dynamic code generation if possible.
