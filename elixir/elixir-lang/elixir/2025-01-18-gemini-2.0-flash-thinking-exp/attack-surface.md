# Attack Surface Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Erlang Term Format - ETF)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data__erlang_term_format_-_etf_.md)

* **Attack Surface: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Erlang Term Format - ETF)**
    * **Description:**  Deserializing data in the Erlang Term Format (ETF) from untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution. ETF is used extensively in Elixir for inter-process communication and data storage.
    * **How Elixir Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elixir applications often rely on ETF for communication between processes (using `send`, `receive`), storing data (e.g., in ETS tables), and potentially when interacting with external systems. The `erlang:term_to_binary/1` and `erlang:binary_to_term/1` functions are central to this.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted binary payload to an Elixir process that deserializes it using `erlang:binary_to_term/1`. This payload contains instructions that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:**  The primary mitigation is to avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources whenever possible.
        * **Use Secure Alternatives for Data Exchange:**  Prefer using well-defined and safer data formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers for communication with external systems or when handling user input.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If deserialization is unavoidable, rigorously validate and sanitize the data *before* deserialization. However, this is extremely difficult to do reliably with ETF.
        * **Consider Using Signed and Encrypted Payloads:** If ETF must be used, sign and encrypt the payloads to ensure integrity and authenticity.
        * **Restrict Access to Deserialization Endpoints:** Limit which processes or services can receive and deserialize ETF data.

## Attack Surface: [Process Flooding and Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/process_flooding_and_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Attack Surface: Process Flooding and Resource Exhaustion**
    * **Description:** An attacker can overwhelm an Elixir process by sending a large number of messages to its mailbox, leading to denial of service or resource exhaustion.
    * **How Elixir Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elixir's actor model relies on message passing. If processes are designed to handle messages without proper backpressure or rate limiting, they become vulnerable to flooding.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor sends a flood of requests to a GenServer process responsible for handling user authentication, overwhelming its mailbox and preventing legitimate users from logging in.
    * **Impact:** **High**. Denial of Service (DoS), impacting application availability and potentially leading to system instability.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation and Rate Limiting:** Validate incoming messages and implement rate limiting to prevent excessive message sending from a single source.
        * **Backpressure Mechanisms:** Implement backpressure strategies to signal to senders when a process is overloaded and cannot accept more messages. This can be done using techniques like `GenStage` or custom logic.
        * **Message Queueing:** Use message queues (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) to buffer incoming requests and decouple senders from receivers, providing resilience against sudden spikes in traffic.
        * **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor process mailboxes and system resources to detect and respond to potential flooding attacks.
        * **Process Supervision and Restarting:** Utilize Elixir's supervision trees to automatically restart processes that crash due to overload, ensuring some level of resilience.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks via `System.cmd` and Similar Functions](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks_via__system_cmd__and_similar_functions.md)

* **Attack Surface: Injection Attacks via `System.cmd` and Similar Functions**
    * **Description:**  Using functions like `System.cmd` or `Port.open` with unsanitized user input can lead to command injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    * **How Elixir Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elixir provides convenient ways to interact with the underlying operating system. If these functions are used without proper care for input sanitization, they become attack vectors.
    * **Example:** An application allows users to specify a filename to process. This filename is then directly used in a `System.cmd` call to execute a system utility. An attacker could provide a malicious filename like `; rm -rf /`, leading to the execution of the `rm` command.
    * **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote Code Execution (RCE), potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, and full server control.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Using `System.cmd` with User Input:**  Whenever possible, avoid using `System.cmd` or similar functions with data derived from user input or external sources.
        * **Input Sanitization and Validation:** If using `System.cmd` is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all input to ensure it does not contain malicious characters or commands. Use allow-lists rather than block-lists.
        * **Use Libraries or Built-in Functions:** Prefer using Elixir libraries or built-in functions for tasks that might otherwise require system commands. For example, use libraries for file manipulation instead of calling `mv` or `cp`.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Elixir application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Node Communication in Distributed Elixir Applications](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-node_communication_in_distributed_elixir_applications.md)

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Inter-Node Communication in Distributed Elixir Applications**
    * **Description:**  Communication between Elixir nodes in a distributed system, if not properly secured, can be vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.
    * **How Elixir Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elixir's support for distributed applications relies on the Erlang distribution protocol. By default, this communication is not encrypted.
    * **Example:** In a clustered Elixir application, sensitive data is exchanged between nodes over an unencrypted connection. An attacker on the network can intercept this traffic and gain access to the data.
    * **Impact:** **High**. Information disclosure, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, and compromise of the distributed system.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enable TLS for Inter-Node Communication:** Configure Elixir and Erlang to use TLS for communication between nodes. This encrypts the traffic and protects against eavesdropping.
        * **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only trusted nodes can join the cluster and communicate with each other. Use cookie-based authentication or other secure methods.
        * **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Ensure the network infrastructure connecting the nodes is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
        * **Avoid Exposing Distribution Ports to the Public Internet:**  Restrict access to the Erlang distribution ports (typically 4369 and a dynamically assigned port) to only trusted networks.
