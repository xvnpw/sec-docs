## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Elixir Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_elixir_application__critical_node_.md)

- This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the Elixir application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Concurrency Issues [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_concurrency_issues__critical_node_.md)

- Elixir's concurrency model, while powerful, introduces opportunities for race conditions and other concurrency-related vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Process Execution Timing](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_process_execution_timing.md)

    - Attackers can attempt to influence the order in which concurrent processes execute to trigger race conditions or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Messages to Trigger Race](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_messages_to_trigger_race.md)

        - Sending specific sequences of messages designed to exploit timing windows in the application's logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overload System to Exacerbate Timing Issues](./attack_tree_paths/overload_system_to_exacerbate_timing_issues.md)

        - Flooding the system with requests to increase the likelihood of race conditions occurring due to unpredictable process scheduling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Uncontrolled Process Spawning [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_uncontrolled_process_spawning__critical_node_.md)

    - If the application allows users to trigger the creation of new processes without proper limits, attackers can exhaust system resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Function Leading to Process Creation](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_function_leading_to_process_creation.md)

        - Identifying and invoking application functionalities that create new processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Repeated Requests to Exhaust Resources](./attack_tree_paths/send_repeated_requests_to_exhaust_resources.md)

        - Sending a high volume of requests to trigger process creation, leading to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, process limits).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Message Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_message_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

    - Improper validation of messages exchanged between Elixir processes can lead to vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Unexpected Message Types](./attack_tree_paths/send_unexpected_message_types.md)

        - Sending messages with types that the receiving process is not designed to handle, potentially causing crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malformed Messages to Crash Processes](./attack_tree_paths/send_malformed_messages_to_crash_processes.md)

        - Sending messages with invalid or unexpected structures to trigger errors and potentially crash processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies (Mix.Exs) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies__mix_exs___critical_node_.md)

- Elixir applications rely on external libraries managed by Mix. This introduces supply chain risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Confusion Attack](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_confusion_attack.md)

    - Attackers can publish malicious packages with the same name as internal or private dependencies, tricking the application into downloading the malicious version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Package with Same Name](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_package_with_same_name.md)

        - Creating and publishing a package with a name that clashes with an internal dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Force Application to Download Malicious Package](./attack_tree_paths/force_application_to_download_malicious_package.md)

        - Exploiting misconfigurations in the package resolution process to prioritize the malicious package.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromised Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/compromised_dependency.md)

    - A vulnerability in a legitimate dependency (direct or transitive) can be exploited to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in a Direct or Transitive Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_a_direct_or_transitive_dependency.md)

        - Identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in any of the application's dependencies.
