### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Elixir Application

**CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Elixir Application**

This node represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the Elixir application, leading to a compromise. This compromise can manifest in various ways, including:

* **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application data, including user credentials, personal information, or business-critical data.
* **Code Execution:**  The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker renders the application unavailable to legitimate users.
* **Account Takeover:**  The attacker gains control of legitimate user accounts.
* **Application Defacement:**  The attacker modifies the application's content or functionality.

To achieve this critical node, an attacker would likely exploit one or more of the following categories of vulnerabilities:
