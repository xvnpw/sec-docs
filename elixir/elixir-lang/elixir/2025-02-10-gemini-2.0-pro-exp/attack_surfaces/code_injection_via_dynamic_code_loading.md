# Deep Analysis: Code Injection via Dynamic Code Loading in Elixir

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with code injection vulnerabilities arising from Elixir's dynamic code loading capabilities.  This includes identifying specific attack vectors, assessing the potential impact, and proposing concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview. We aim to provide the development team with the knowledge necessary to prevent this class of vulnerability effectively.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Elixir Language Features:**  `Code.eval_string`, `Code.eval_quoted`, `Code.require_file`, `Code.load_file`, `Module.create/3`, and any other built-in functions that allow dynamic code execution or module creation.
*   **Common Use Cases:**  Identifying scenarios where developers might be tempted to use dynamic code loading with user-supplied data (e.g., configuration files, user-defined scripts, plugin systems).
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Exploring how an attacker might exploit these features, including specific input crafting techniques.
*   **Mitigation Techniques:**  Providing detailed, practical guidance on preventing code injection, including code examples and best practices.
* **Impact on different deployment scenarios:** How the impact changes if the application is running as root, a limited user, or within a container.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General code injection vulnerabilities unrelated to Elixir's dynamic code loading (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, except as they relate to dynamic code loading.
*   Denial-of-service attacks, unless they are a direct consequence of code injection.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Feature Examination:**  Detailed review of the Elixir documentation and source code for the relevant functions (`Code` and `Module` modules).
2.  **Use Case Analysis:**  Identify common patterns and anti-patterns in Elixir code that could lead to dynamic code loading vulnerabilities.  This includes reviewing open-source projects and community discussions.
3.  **Attack Vector Simulation:**  Construct proof-of-concept exploits to demonstrate how an attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Develop and refine mitigation strategies, providing concrete code examples and best practices.
5.  **Impact Assessment:** Analyze the potential consequences of successful code injection in various deployment scenarios.
6.  **Documentation:**  Compile the findings into this comprehensive report.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Elixir's Dynamic Code Loading Mechanisms

Elixir provides several functions for dynamic code loading and execution:

*   **`Code.eval_string(string, binding \\ [], opts \\ [])`:**  Evaluates a string of Elixir code.  The `binding` allows passing variables into the evaluated code.  `opts` can control compilation options.  This is the *most dangerous* function if used with untrusted input.
*   **`Code.eval_quoted(quoted, binding \\ [], opts \\ [])`:** Similar to `eval_string`, but takes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation instead of a string.  While slightly less direct, it's still highly vulnerable if the AST is derived from user input.
*   **`Code.require_file(path, opts \\ [])`:**  Loads and compiles an Elixir file.  If the `path` is controlled by an attacker, they can point it to a malicious file.
*   **`Code.load_file(path, opts \\ [])`:** Similar to `require_file`, but doesn't raise an error if the file has already been loaded.  Still vulnerable to path manipulation.
*   **`Module.create(module, quoted, opts \\ [])`:**  Dynamically creates a module from an AST.  Again, if the `quoted` AST is derived from user input, this is vulnerable.
* **`spawn/1, spawn/3, spawn_link/1, spawn_link/3` and related functions:** While not directly loading code, these functions create new processes. If the function or arguments passed to `spawn` are derived from user input, it could lead to code injection. For example, if an attacker can control the module and function name passed to `spawn`, they could execute arbitrary code.

### 4.2. Common Use Cases and Anti-Patterns

Here are some scenarios where developers might be tempted to use dynamic code loading, and how they can become vulnerabilities:

*   **User-Defined Plugins/Extensions:**  A system that allows users to upload Elixir code to extend functionality.  If the uploaded code is loaded directly using `Code.require_file` or `Code.eval_string` without proper sandboxing, it's a major vulnerability.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Using Elixir code as configuration files and loading them with `Code.require_file`.  If an attacker can modify the configuration file, they can inject code.
*   **Dynamic Dispatch Based on User Input:**  Constructing module or function names based on user input and then calling them dynamically.  For example:
    ```elixir
    # VULNERABLE!
    module_name = String.to_atom(params["module"])
    function_name = String.to_atom(params["function"])
    apply(module_name, function_name, [params["arg"]])
    ```
*   **"Eval" Features in Web Applications:**  Providing a web interface where users can enter and execute Elixir code snippets (e.g., for educational purposes or debugging).  This is inherently dangerous without extremely robust sandboxing.
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** If Elixir terms (including code) are serialized and then deserialized from an untrusted source (e.g., a message queue, a database), an attacker could inject malicious code during deserialization.  `Kernel.binary_to_term/2` with the `:safe` option should *always* be used, and even then, caution is advised.

### 4.3. Attack Vector Examples

*   **`Code.eval_string` Injection:**
    ```elixir
    # Vulnerable code:
    user_input = params["code"] # Assume this comes from a web form
    Code.eval_string(user_input)

    # Attacker input (in params["code"]):
    "; System.cmd(\"rm\", [\"-rf\", \"/\"]); :ok"
    ```
    This would attempt to delete the root directory (if the process has sufficient privileges). The `; :ok` is added to ensure the injected code is a valid Elixir expression.

*   **`Code.require_file` Path Traversal:**
    ```elixir
    # Vulnerable code:
    user_provided_path = params["plugin_path"]
    Code.require_file("plugins/#{user_provided_path}.ex")

    # Attacker input (in params["plugin_path"]):
    "../../../../etc/passwd"
    ```
    This would attempt to load the `/etc/passwd` file as an Elixir module, potentially leading to information disclosure or errors that reveal system details.  A more sophisticated attacker would provide a path to a file they control, containing malicious Elixir code.

*   **`Module.create` Injection:**
    ```elixir
    # Vulnerable code (highly contrived, but illustrative):
    user_input = params["module_definition"]
    quoted = Code.string_to_quoted!(user_input)
    Module.create(MyModule, quoted, __ENV__)

    # Attacker input (in params["module_definition"]):
    "defmodule MyModule do; def evil_function do; System.cmd(\"whoami\", []); end; end"
    ```
    This would create a module named `MyModule` with an `evil_function` that executes the `whoami` command.

* **`spawn` injection:**
    ```elixir
    #Vulnerable code
    module_name = String.to_atom(params["module"])
    function_name = String.to_atom(params["function"])
    spawn(module_name, function_name, [])

    #Attacker input
    # params["module"] = "IO"
    # params["function"] = "puts"
    # params["args"] = ["$(whoami)"] # This won't work directly, needs further exploitation

    # More realistic attacker input (using a pre-existing, vulnerable module)
    # Assume there's a module VulnerableModule with a function execute_command/1
    # params["module"] = "VulnerableModule"
    # params["function"] = "execute_command"
    # params["args"] = ["rm -rf /"] # Or any other malicious command
    ```
    This example highlights that even without direct code evaluation, controlling the function called by `spawn` can be dangerous.

### 4.4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Avoid Dynamic Code Loading with User Input (Primary Mitigation):**  This is the most crucial step.  Re-architect the application to avoid needing to execute user-provided code.  Consider alternative approaches:
    *   **For plugins:** Use a well-defined interface and load plugins from a trusted directory.  Implement a whitelist of allowed functions or modules.  Consider using a separate process for plugin execution with limited privileges (sandboxing).
    *   **For configuration:** Use a data format like JSON, YAML, or TOML instead of Elixir code.  If you *must* use Elixir code, parse it using `Code.string_to_quoted!/2` and then *inspect the AST* to ensure it only contains allowed constructs.  *Never* use `Code.eval_string` or `Code.require_file` directly on configuration files.
    *   **For dynamic dispatch:** Use a map of allowed functions instead of constructing module and function names dynamically.
        ```elixir
        # Safe approach:
        allowed_functions = %{
          "action1" => &MyModule.action1/1,
          "action2" => &MyModule.action2/1
        }

        function = Map.get(allowed_functions, params["action"])
        if function do
          function.(params["arg"])
        else
          # Handle invalid action
        end
        ```

2.  **Strict Input Validation (If Unavoidable):**  If dynamic code loading is absolutely necessary (which should be extremely rare and heavily justified), implement rigorous input validation:
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters, patterns, or values.  Reject anything that doesn't match the whitelist.  *Never* use blacklisting.
    *   **Regular Expressions (with caution):**  Use regular expressions to validate the *structure* of the input, but be aware of ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities.  Use simple, well-tested regular expressions.
    *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce strict length limits on any input that influences code loading.
    *   **Path Sanitization:**  If dealing with file paths, use `Path.expand/1` and `Path.absname/1` to resolve the path and ensure it's within the expected directory.  Check for directory traversal attempts (`../`).  Use a whitelist of allowed directories.

3.  **Code Signing (Limited Applicability):**  While not common in Elixir, code signing could be used to verify the integrity of loaded modules.  This would require a trusted certificate authority and a mechanism to verify signatures before loading code. This is more complex to implement and maintain.

4.  **Dependency Management:**  Use Hex (the Elixir package manager) and keep dependencies updated.  Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.  Consider using tools like `mix audit` (available in newer Elixir versions) or `Sobelow` to identify potential security issues.

5.  **Sandboxing (Advanced):**  For high-risk scenarios (like user-provided plugins), consider running the dynamically loaded code in a separate process with severely restricted privileges.  This can be achieved using:
    *   **OS-Level Sandboxing:**  Use tools like `chroot`, `jails` (FreeBSD), or `containers` (Docker, LXC) to isolate the process.
    *   **Elixir's `Port`:**  Use Elixir's `Port` mechanism to communicate with an external process (written in another language, perhaps) that executes the untrusted code in a sandboxed environment.

6.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the Elixir application with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid running as `root`.  Use a dedicated user account with limited access to the file system and other resources.

7.  **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews, focusing on areas where dynamic code loading is used.  Use static analysis tools (like `Sobelow`) to identify potential vulnerabilities.

8. **Deserialization Safety:** Always use `Kernel.binary_to_term(binary, [:safe])` when deserializing data from untrusted sources. Even with `:safe`, be extremely cautious about deserializing complex terms. Consider using a safer data format like JSON for untrusted data exchange.

### 4.5. Impact Assessment in Different Deployment Scenarios

*   **Running as Root:**  Complete system compromise is highly likely.  The attacker could gain full control of the server, access all data, install malware, and pivot to other systems.
*   **Running as a Limited User:**  The impact is reduced, but still significant.  The attacker could access and modify data accessible to that user, potentially escalate privileges through other vulnerabilities, or disrupt the application.
*   **Running within a Container (e.g., Docker):**  The container provides some isolation, but it's not a perfect security boundary.  The attacker could potentially escape the container (through container escape vulnerabilities) or compromise other containers running on the same host.  The impact depends on the container's configuration (e.g., capabilities, network access, mounted volumes).  Properly configured containers significantly reduce the attack surface.
* **Serverless Functions:** The impact is usually limited to the single invocation of the function. However, if the attacker can modify the function's code or configuration, they could gain persistent access.

## 5. Conclusion

Dynamic code loading in Elixir, while powerful, presents a significant security risk if misused.  The primary mitigation is to *avoid* using user-supplied input in functions like `Code.eval_string`, `Code.require_file`, and `Module.create/3`.  If dynamic code loading is unavoidable, rigorous input validation, whitelisting, and sandboxing techniques are essential.  Running the application with the least privilege and regularly auditing the codebase are crucial for maintaining security.  Developers should prioritize secure coding practices and be acutely aware of the potential consequences of code injection vulnerabilities.
