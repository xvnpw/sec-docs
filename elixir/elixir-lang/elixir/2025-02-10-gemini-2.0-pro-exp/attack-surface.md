# Attack Surface Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Distribution](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__via_distribution.md)

**Description:** Unauthenticated or weakly authenticated access to the Erlang distribution mechanism allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Elixir Contribution:** Elixir's built-in distribution features (and reliance on Erlang's distribution) make clustering and remote communication easy, but this ease of use can lead to insecure configurations if not carefully managed. The standard library provides functions like `:rpc` and `Node` that, if exposed insecurely, are direct RCE vectors.

**Example:** An attacker connects to an Elixir node running with the default cookie (`CHANGEME`) and uses `:rpc.call` to execute a system command, such as downloading and running a malicious script.

**Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the server and can steal data, install malware, or use the server for further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong, Unique Cookies:** *Always* use a strong, randomly generated, and unique cookie for each deployment. Never use the default. Store the cookie securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets manager).
    *   **Firewall:** Block all external access to the Erlang distribution port (4369 and dynamic ports) unless absolutely necessary. Only allow connections from trusted hosts/networks, using a properly configured firewall.
    *   **TLS for Distribution:** Enable TLS for *all* distributed communication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure confidentiality. Configure strong cipher suites and verify certificates.
    *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously sanitize any user input that could *possibly* influence node connections or remote function calls. Assume all input is malicious.
    *   **Disable Distribution if Unused:** If the application doesn't *require* distribution, disable it completely to eliminate this attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Process Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_process_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker overwhelms the system by causing the creation of a large number of Elixir processes, exhausting available resources and crashing the application.

**Elixir Contribution:** Elixir's lightweight processes are a core strength, enabling high concurrency. However, uncontrolled process creation is a significant DoS vector *because* spawning processes is so easy and efficient.  This efficiency makes it easier for an attacker to trigger a large number of processes.

**Example:** An attacker sends a flood of HTTP requests, each of which triggers the creation of a new GenServer process (e.g., a new process per connection). Without limits, this quickly exhausts the process table.

**Impact:** Application unavailability. The server becomes unresponsive and crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Process Supervision:** Use supervisors to manage processes and automatically restart them if they crash. Configure restart limits (intensity and period) to prevent rapid process churn and potential cascading failures.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application and/or infrastructure level (e.g., using a reverse proxy or API gateway) to prevent attackers from sending excessive requests. This is crucial for any publicly exposed endpoint.
    *   **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for *all* operations, especially those involving external resources, network communication, or potentially long-running computations. This prevents processes from getting stuck indefinitely.
    *   **Bounded Mailboxes:** Consider using bounded mailboxes (e.g., with the `gen_statem` behavior or libraries that provide this functionality) to prevent unbounded message queue growth, which can lead to memory exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor process count, memory usage, and message queue lengths. Set up alerts for anomalies to detect potential DoS attacks early.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Dynamic Code Loading](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_dynamic_code_loading.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in dynamic code loading mechanisms.

**Elixir Contribution:** Elixir's ability to dynamically load and execute code (e.g., `Code.eval_string`, `Code.require_file`, `Module.create/3`) provides flexibility but introduces a significant code injection risk if misused. This is a *direct* feature of the language.

**Example:** An attacker provides a malicious string as input to a form field that is then passed to `Code.eval_string`, allowing them to execute arbitrary Elixir code.  Another example: an attacker influences the file path passed to `Code.require_file`.

**Impact:** Potentially complete system compromise, depending on the privileges of the running process. The attacker could gain access to data, modify the application, or execute system commands.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Loading with User Input:** *Never* use user-provided input directly in functions like `Code.eval_string`, `Code.require_file`, or `Module.create/3`. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** If dynamic code loading is *absolutely unavoidable* (which is extremely rare and should be questioned), rigorously validate and sanitize any input that influences the code to be loaded. Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good values) instead of blacklisting.
    *   **Code Signing:** Consider code signing to verify the integrity of loaded modules, although this is less common in the Elixir ecosystem.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a trusted package manager (Hex) and keep dependencies updated to minimize the risk of compromised packages being loaded.
