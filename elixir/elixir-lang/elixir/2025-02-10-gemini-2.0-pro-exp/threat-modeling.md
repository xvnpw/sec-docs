# Threat Model Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

## Threat: [Process Spoofing/Impersonation](./threats/process_spoofingimpersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious messages and sends them to a GenServer (or other process) pretending to be a legitimate process. They achieve this by guessing or obtaining the target process's PID or registered name, especially if predictable naming schemes are used.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can trigger unintended actions within the targeted process, potentially leading to data modification, unauthorized access to resources, or disruption of service. The attacker might bypass intended authorization checks.
*   **Affected Component:** `GenServer`, `Agent`, `Task`, any process that receives messages (especially those using `Process.register` with predictable names).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if the targeted process handles sensitive data or critical operations).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid predictable process names. Use dynamically generated, unique identifiers (e.g., UUIDs) when registering processes.
    *   Implement authentication/authorization *within* the message handling logic. Pass a token or credential in the message itself, rather than relying solely on the sender's PID.
    *   Use `Process.send_after` with a unique reference for delayed messages.
    *   Employ process groups and monitoring to detect anomalous process behavior.

## Threat: [Node Impersonation (Distributed Elixir)](./threats/node_impersonation__distributed_elixir_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to join a distributed Elixir cluster as a rogue node. If successful, they can intercept messages, access data, and potentially execute code on other nodes. This is facilitated by weak or default distribution settings.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the distributed system. The attacker gains access to all data and functionality across the cluster.
*   **Affected Component:** Distributed Elixir (`Node.connect`, `:net_kernel`, epmd).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory:** Use TLS for all distributed Elixir communication. Configure certificates and secure connections.
    *   Use a strong, randomly generated cookie for node authentication. Change the default cookie.
    *   Restrict network access using firewalls. Allow only trusted nodes to connect on distribution ports.
    *   Consider VPNs or secure network tunnels for inter-node communication.

## Threat: [Code Injection via `Code.eval_string`](./threats/code_injection_via__code_eval_string_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is passed to `Code.eval_string`, `Code.eval_quoted`, or similar functions. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Elixir code within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the application and potentially the underlying operating system.
*   **Affected Component:** `Code` module (specifically `eval_string`, `eval_quoted`, `compile_string`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Primary:** Avoid using `Code.eval_string` and related functions with *any* untrusted input.
    *   If unavoidable, implement *extremely* rigorous input sanitization and validation (though this is highly discouraged due to its difficulty).
    *   Explore safer alternatives like parsers or controlled code generation.

## Threat: [ETS/DETS Table Tampering](./threats/etsdets_table_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a process with write permissions to a shared ETS or DETS table. They modify the table's contents, corrupting data, disrupting application logic, or causing unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application instability, potential denial of service, or incorrect results. The severity depends on the importance of the data stored in the table.
*   **Affected Component:** `ets` and `dets` modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the table's purpose and access control).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `:protected` or `:private` access control when creating ETS/DETS tables. Avoid `:public` unless strictly necessary.
    *   Restrict write access to the minimum number of processes.
    *   Implement a dedicated process (e.g., a GenServer) to manage table access and enforce rules.
    *   Perform data validation and integrity checks on both read and write operations.

## Threat: [Hot Code Reloading Abuse](./threats/hot_code_reloading_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to trigger a hot code reload with malicious code, replacing legitimate code with their own.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, similar to code injection. The attacker gains control over the application's behavior.
*   **Affected Component:** Code loading mechanisms, release handling, potentially custom scripts or functions used for deployments.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable or severely restrict hot code reloading in production environments.
    *   Digitally sign code releases and verify signatures before loading.
    *   Implement strict access controls on code reload triggers.
    *   Monitor for unexpected code reloads.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Distributed Elixir Communication](./threats/unencrypted_distributed_elixir_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker eavesdrops on the network traffic between nodes in a distributed Elixir cluster that is not using TLS. They intercept messages, potentially revealing sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure. The attacker can read all data exchanged between nodes, including potentially sensitive information.
*   **Affected Component:** Distributed Elixir (`Node.connect`, `:net_kernel`, epmd).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** (Same as Node Impersonation)
    *   **Mandatory:** Use TLS for all distributed Elixir communication.
    *   Use a strong, randomly generated cookie.
    *   Restrict network access.
    *   Consider VPNs or secure tunnels.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Process Memory](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_process_memory.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data (passwords, API keys) remains in process memory after it's no longer needed due to the BEAM's garbage collection behavior. An attacker with access to memory dumps or other memory inspection techniques could potentially recover this data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure. The attacker gains access to sensitive credentials or data.
*   **Affected Component:** Any process handling sensitive data; potentially ETS/DETS if used to store sensitive information without encryption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize the lifetime of sensitive data in memory. Overwrite variables with dummy values after use.
    *   Consider secure memory allocation libraries or techniques.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data in long-lived processes or ETS/DETS without encryption.
    *   Prefer binaries for sensitive string data.

## Threat: [Process Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/process_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates a large number of processes, exceeding the BEAM's process limit, preventing the application from creating new processes needed for normal operation.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
*   **Affected Component:** The BEAM VM itself; any code that creates processes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Set a reasonable maximum process limit using the `+P` option when starting the VM.
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive process creation from a single source.
    *   Use process supervisors for automatic restart and resource management.
    *   Monitor process count and alert on anomalies.

## Threat: [Message Queue Overflow (DoS)](./threats/message_queue_overflow__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends messages to a process faster than it can handle them, causing the process's message queue to grow unbounded, leading to memory exhaustion and a crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service. The targeted process and potentially the entire application become unresponsive.
*   **Affected Component:** Any process that receives messages (GenServers, Agents, Tasks, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use bounded message queues (set a maximum queue length).
    *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to signal message producers to slow down.
    *   Monitor message queue lengths and alert on excessive growth.
    *   Use asynchronous processing (e.g., `Task.async`) to avoid blocking.

## Threat: [Atom Table Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/atom_table_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker causes the application to create a large number of unique atoms (e.g., by converting user-supplied strings to atoms), exhausting the atom table and causing the VM to crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service. The entire BEAM VM crashes.
*   **Affected Component:** Any code that uses `String.to_atom` or `:\"#{...}\" (string interpolation that creates atoms) with untrusted input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucial:** Avoid converting untrusted user input directly to atoms.
    *   Use a predefined set of atoms whenever possible.
    *   If dynamic atom creation is necessary, use a strict whitelist.
    *   Prefer strings or binaries for data that doesn't require atom-specific features.
    *   Monitor the atom table size.

## Threat: [CPU Starvation (DoS)](./threats/cpu_starvation__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** A long-running NIF or BIF, or a computationally intensive operation within a process, blocks the scheduler, preventing other processes from running.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service or significant performance degradation. The application becomes unresponsive or slow.
*   **Affected Component:** NIFs, BIFs, any Elixir code performing long-running computations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid long-running computations in the main event loop.
    *   Use `Task.async` or GenServers to offload work to separate processes.
    *   Design NIFs to be non-blocking or yield to the scheduler. Use "dirty NIFs" with extreme caution.
    *   Implement timeouts for potentially long operations.

## Threat: [Unsafe NIF Usage (Privilege Escalation)](./threats/unsafe_nif_usage__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerable NIF (Native Implemented Function) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code at the operating system level, potentially gaining elevated privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** NIFs (written in C or other languages).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and audit all NIFs.
    *   Use well-vetted NIF libraries.
    *   Avoid writing custom NIFs unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Follow secure coding practices for the NIF's language.
    *   Consider "dirty NIFs" for isolation (but be aware of performance).
    *   Run the application with minimal OS privileges.

## Threat: [Misuse of System Processes (Privilege Escalation)](./threats/misuse_of_system_processes__privilege_escalation_.md)

* **Description:** The attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the application to execute arbitrary system commands through functions like `os:cmd/1` or similar, potentially with elevated privileges.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or unauthorized system modifications.
    * **Affected Component:** `os` module (specifically functions like `cmd/1`), `System.cmd/3`, and any other functions that interact with the operating system shell.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to system-level functions to highly trusted parts of the application.
        *   Implement rigorous input sanitization and validation for *any* data passed to system commands.  Use whitelisting whenever possible.
        *   Avoid using system commands if equivalent Elixir/Erlang functionalities are available.
        *   Run the application with the least necessary operating system privileges.  Do not run as root.
        *   Consider using a dedicated, sandboxed process for executing system commands, if absolutely necessary.
