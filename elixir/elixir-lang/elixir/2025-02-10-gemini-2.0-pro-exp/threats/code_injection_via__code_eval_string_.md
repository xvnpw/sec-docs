# Deep Analysis: Code Injection via `Code.eval_string` in Elixir

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the threat of code injection via the `Code.eval_string` family of functions in Elixir.  This includes understanding the attack vectors, potential consequences, and effective mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview provided in the initial threat model.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent this vulnerability.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `Code` module in Elixir, particularly the functions:

*   `Code.eval_string/3`
*   `Code.eval_quoted/3`
*   `Code.compile_string/2`
*   `Code.compile_quoted/2`
*   Any other function within the `Code` module that dynamically executes Elixir code based on string or AST input.

The analysis will cover:

*   How these functions can be exploited.
*   The types of input that can trigger the vulnerability.
*   The impact of successful exploitation.
*   Detailed mitigation strategies, including code examples and best practices.
*   Alternative approaches to achieving similar functionality without using dynamic code evaluation.
*   Limitations of mitigation strategies.

The analysis *excludes* other forms of code injection (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) that are not directly related to the Elixir `Code` module.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Thorough examination of the official Elixir documentation for the `Code` module and related functions.
2.  **Code Analysis:**  Review of example code snippets (both vulnerable and secure) to illustrate the attack and mitigation techniques.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigation of known vulnerabilities and exploits related to dynamic code evaluation in Elixir and other languages (to understand common patterns).
4.  **Best Practices Review:**  Consultation of established security best practices for Elixir and general secure coding guidelines.
5.  **Scenario Analysis:**  Development of realistic scenarios where this vulnerability might occur in an Elixir application.
6.  **Expert Consultation:** (Implicit) Leveraging existing cybersecurity expertise and knowledge.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Attack Vectors and Exploitation

The core vulnerability lies in the ability of `Code.eval_string` (and related functions) to execute arbitrary Elixir code provided as a string.  An attacker can exploit this by injecting malicious code into any input field that is subsequently passed to one of these functions.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```elixir
defmodule Unsafe do
  def evaluate(user_input) do
    Code.eval_string(user_input)
  end
end

# Attacker input:  "IO.puts(:os.cmd('rm -rf /'))"
Unsafe.evaluate("IO.puts(:os.cmd('rm -rf /'))") # Extremely dangerous!
```

In this example, if an attacker can control the `user_input`, they can execute arbitrary shell commands.  The provided example attempts to delete the root directory (which would likely fail due to permissions, but demonstrates the potential for severe damage).  The attacker doesn't need to inject a complete Elixir module; any valid Elixir expression will be executed.

**Common Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Web Applications:**  User input from forms, URL parameters, or API requests that are directly or indirectly used in `Code.eval_string`.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Loading configuration data from untrusted sources (e.g., user-uploaded files) and evaluating parts of it as Elixir code.
*   **Templating Systems:**  If a templating system uses `Code.eval_string` to process user-provided templates, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Database Queries:**  Constructing dynamic queries where parts of the query are built using user input and then evaluated. (This is more common with Ecto's dynamic query features, but could theoretically be combined with `Code.eval_string`).
* **Message Queues:** Processing messages from untrusted sources that contain Elixir code to be evaluated.

### 2.2. Impact of Successful Exploitation

The impact is **complete system compromise**.  Successful code injection allows the attacker to:

*   **Execute Arbitrary Code:** Run any Elixir code within the application's context.
*   **Access Sensitive Data:** Read, modify, or delete data stored by the application (databases, files, etc.).
*   **Execute System Commands:**  Use `System.cmd` or `:os.cmd` (as shown in the example) to execute commands on the underlying operating system.
*   **Network Access:**  Make network connections, potentially exfiltrating data or attacking other systems.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Crash the application or consume excessive resources.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially gain higher privileges on the system.
* **Persistence:** Install backdoors or other malicious software to maintain access.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

#### 2.3.1. Avoidance (Primary and Best Practice)

The **absolute best mitigation** is to **completely avoid** using `Code.eval_string` and related functions with *any* input that originates from an untrusted source, even indirectly.  This includes:

*   User input (web forms, API requests, etc.).
*   Data from external databases or APIs.
*   Configuration files from untrusted sources.
*   Data received over the network.

If you find yourself needing to evaluate user-provided code, fundamentally reconsider your application's design.  There are almost always safer alternatives.

#### 2.3.2. Safer Alternatives

Instead of dynamic code evaluation, consider these alternatives:

*   **Parsers:** If the user input represents a specific language or data format (e.g., JSON, XML, a custom DSL), use a dedicated parser.  Elixir has excellent libraries for parsing various formats (e.g., `Jason` for JSON, `SweetXml` for XML).  For custom DSLs, consider using a parser generator like `NimbleParsec` or `leex` and `yecc`.

    ```elixir
    # Example using Jason (JSON parser) - SAFE
    defmodule Safe do
      def parse_json(user_input) do
        case Jason.decode(user_input) do
          {:ok, data} ->
            # Process the parsed data (which is now a safe Elixir data structure)
            IO.inspect(data)
          {:error, reason} ->
            # Handle parsing errors
            IO.puts("Invalid JSON: #{reason}")
        end
      end
    end

    Safe.parse_json(~s({"key": "value"})) # Safe
    Safe.parse_json(~s({"key": "value", "evil": "IO.puts(:os.cmd('rm -rf /'))"})) # Safe - the "evil" key is just a string.
    ```

*   **Controlled Code Generation:** If you need to generate code dynamically, do so in a controlled and predictable manner.  Instead of evaluating arbitrary strings, build the code using Elixir's metaprogramming features (macros, `quote`, `unquote`) with carefully validated inputs.  This allows you to generate code *without* ever evaluating an untrusted string.

    ```elixir
    # Example:  Safely generating a function call based on a validated input.
    defmodule SafeCaller do
      def call_function(function_name, arguments) when is_atom(function_name) and is_list(arguments) do
        # Whitelist allowed functions
        case function_name do
          :add ->
            apply(Kernel, :+, arguments)
          :subtract ->
            apply(Kernel, :-, arguments)
          _ ->
            raise "Invalid function name"
        end
      end
       def call_function(_function_name, _arguments), do: raise "Invalid input types"
    end

    SafeCaller.call_function(:add, [1, 2]) # => 3
    SafeCaller.call_function(:subtract, [5, 2]) # => 3
    # SafeCaller.call_function(:os.cmd, ["rm -rf /"])  # Raises "Invalid function name"
    ```

*   **Data Validation and Whitelisting:**  If the user input is expected to be a specific value or from a limited set of options, use strict whitelisting.  Do *not* try to "sanitize" the input by removing dangerous characters; it's almost impossible to do this reliably.

    ```elixir
    # Example: Whitelisting allowed operations
    defmodule SafeOperation do
      def perform_operation(operation, a, b) do
        case operation do
          "add" -> a + b
          "subtract" -> a - b
          "multiply" -> a * b
          "divide" -> a / b
          _ -> raise "Invalid operation"
        end
      end
    end

    SafeOperation.perform_operation("add", 2, 3) # => 5
    # SafeOperation.perform_operation("evil", 2, 3) # Raises "Invalid operation"
    ```

*   **Sandboxing (Extremely Difficult and Not Recommended):**  In theory, it might be possible to create a highly restricted sandbox environment to execute untrusted code.  However, this is *extremely* complex and prone to errors.  It would require deep understanding of the Erlang VM and careful control over all aspects of the execution environment (memory, I/O, system calls, etc.).  This approach is **strongly discouraged** unless you have extensive security expertise and are willing to invest significant effort in maintaining the sandbox.  Even then, it's likely to be less secure than the other alternatives.

#### 2.3.3. Input Sanitization and Validation (Highly Discouraged)

If, *and only if*, you absolutely *must* use `Code.eval_string` with untrusted input (which is almost never the case), you would need to implement *extremely* rigorous input sanitization and validation.  **This is the least secure option and is highly discouraged.**  It's incredibly difficult to anticipate all possible attack vectors and create a truly secure sanitization routine.

**Even if you think you've sanitized the input, there's a high probability of overlooking something.**  Attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass security measures.

**If you choose this path (against strong advice), you MUST:**

1.  **Understand Elixir Syntax:**  Have a deep understanding of Elixir's syntax and how code is parsed and evaluated.
2.  **Whitelist, Don't Blacklist:**  Define a very strict whitelist of allowed characters and constructs, rather than trying to blacklist dangerous ones.
3.  **Limit Input Length:**  Impose a strict limit on the length of the input.
4.  **Regularly Review and Update:**  Continuously review and update your sanitization logic as new attack techniques are discovered.
5.  **Extensive Testing:**  Perform extensive penetration testing and fuzzing to try to break your sanitization.
6. **Consider AST parsing:** Parse the string into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) using `Code.string_to_quoted/2` and then analyze the AST to ensure it only contains allowed constructs. This is still complex and error-prone, but it's *slightly* better than trying to sanitize the raw string. *However*, even with AST analysis, you must be extremely careful about what you allow.

**Example (Flawed Sanitization - DO NOT USE):**

```elixir
# THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT *NOT* TO DO.  IT IS INSECURE.
defmodule UnsafeSanitizer do
  def sanitize(input) do
    # Remove potentially dangerous characters (INCOMPLETE AND INSECURE)
    String.replace(input, ~r/[;()]/, "")
  end

  def evaluate(user_input) do
    sanitized_input = sanitize(user_input)
    Code.eval_string(sanitized_input)
  end
end

# Attacker input: "IO.puts :os.cmd 'rm -rf /'"
UnsafeSanitizer.evaluate("IO.puts :os.cmd 'rm -rf /'") # Still executes the command!
```

This example demonstrates how easily sanitization can be bypassed.  The attacker simply used single quotes instead of double quotes to avoid the (incomplete) character filtering.

### 2.4. Limitations of Mitigation Strategies

*   **Complexity:**  Implementing secure alternatives like controlled code generation or parsers can be more complex than simply using `Code.eval_string`.
*   **Performance:**  Parsing and validating input can have performance implications, especially for complex data formats.
*   **Human Error:**  Even with the best intentions, developers can make mistakes that introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  There's always the possibility of unknown vulnerabilities (zero-day exploits) in the Elixir runtime or libraries that could bypass even the most robust security measures.

## 3. Conclusion

Code injection via `Code.eval_string` and related functions is a critical security vulnerability in Elixir applications.  The best mitigation is to **completely avoid** using these functions with untrusted input.  If dynamic code evaluation is absolutely necessary, explore safer alternatives like parsers or controlled code generation.  Input sanitization is highly discouraged due to its inherent complexity and the high risk of overlooking vulnerabilities.  By understanding the attack vectors, impact, and mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of code injection vulnerabilities in their Elixir applications.  Prioritize secure design and avoid dynamic code evaluation whenever possible.
