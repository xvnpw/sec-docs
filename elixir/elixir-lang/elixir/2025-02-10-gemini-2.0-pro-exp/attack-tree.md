# Attack Tree Analysis for elixir-lang/elixir

Objective: Gain Remote Code Value (RCE) [HIGH]

## Attack Tree Visualization

*   **Exploit Distribution/Cl
    *   **2. Cookie Theft** [HIGH]
        *   **Description:** If an attacker can obtain the Erlang cookie (a shared secret used for node authentication), they can impersonate a legitimate node and execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on how the cookie is stored and managed. If it's hardcoded in a publicly accessible file, likelihood is high.)
        *   **Impact:** High (Complete system compromise, similar to EPMD attack.)
        *   **Effort:** Variable (Could be easy if the cookie is poorly protected, very difficult if it's stored securely.)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Understanding of Erlang distribution is needed, but the attack itself can be simple if the cookie is exposed.)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to detect unless you have robust intrusion detection systems monitoring for unusual node connections.)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Secure Cookie Storage:** Never hardcode the cookie in source code. Use environment variables or a secure configuration store.
            *   **Restrict File Permissions:** Ensure the cookie file (usually `.erlang.cookie`) has the most restrictive permissions possible (e.g., `chmod 600`).
            *   **Regular Cookie Rotation:** Change the cookie periodically.
            *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Elixir cluster on a separate network segment.

*   **Exploit Elixir-Specific Code Issues
    *   **5. Code Loading Vulnerabilities (e.g., `Code.eval_string/1`)** [HIGH]
        *   **Description:** If an attacker can inject code into functions like `Code.eval_string/1` or `Code.eval_quoted/1`, they can execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires a significant vulnerability in the application logic to allow user input to reach these functions.)
        *   **Impact:** High (Complete system compromise.)
        *   **Effort:** High (Requires finding and exploiting a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code injection.)
        *   **Skill Level:** High (Requires a good understanding of Elixir and security vulnerabilities.)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (Code audits and static analysis can help, but dynamic code evaluation can be difficult to track.)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Evaluation:** Do *not* use `Code.eval_string/1` or `Code.eval_quoted/1` with untrusted input. There are almost always safer alternatives.
            *   **Input Sanitization:** If dynamic code evaluation is absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate any user-provided input.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the code runs with the minimum necessary privileges.
