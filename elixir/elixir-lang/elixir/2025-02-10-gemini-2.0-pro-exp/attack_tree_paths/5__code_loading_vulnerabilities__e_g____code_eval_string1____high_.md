# Deep Analysis: Code Loading Vulnerabilities in Elixir Applications (`Code.eval_string/1`)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with the `Code.eval_string/1` (and related functions like `Code.eval_quoted/1`) attack vector in Elixir applications.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific scenarios where this vulnerability could be exploited.
*   Assess the practical likelihood and impact of such exploits.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendations.
*   Develop detection methods to identify potential vulnerabilities in existing code.
*   Provide guidance for developers to avoid introducing this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target:** Elixir applications built using the Elixir language and potentially leveraging the Phoenix framework or other Elixir libraries.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Exploitation of `Code.eval_string/1`, `Code.eval_quoted/1`, and any other function that allows dynamic code execution from a string or quoted expression.  We will consider both direct and indirect uses (e.g., a library wrapping these functions).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Scenarios where attacker-controlled input can reach these dynamic code evaluation functions.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover other types of code injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) unless they directly relate to triggering Elixir code execution.  We also do not cover vulnerabilities in the Elixir runtime itself, focusing instead on application-level misuse.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  We will examine hypothetical and (if available) real-world code examples to identify vulnerable patterns.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  We will construct realistic attack scenarios to understand how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Static Analysis:**  We will discuss the use of static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  We will explore techniques for dynamically testing applications to identify code injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Literature Review:**  We will review existing security advisories, blog posts, and research papers related to code injection in Elixir.
*   **Best Practices Research:** We will identify and document secure coding practices to prevent this vulnerability.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: `Code.eval_string/1`

### 4.1. Understanding the Vulnerability

`Code.eval_string/1` and `Code.eval_quoted/1` are powerful functions in Elixir that allow for the dynamic execution of Elixir code.  `Code.eval_string/1` takes a string containing Elixir code and executes it, returning the result. `Code.eval_quoted/1` does the same, but with a quoted expression (AST).  The danger lies in allowing *untrusted* input (e.g., user input from a web form, data from an external API, contents of a file) to be passed directly to these functions.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```elixir
defmodule MyWebApp.UserController do
  use MyWebApp, :controller

  def eval_code(conn, %{"code" => code}) do
    try do
      result = Code.eval_string(code)
      render(conn, "result.html", result: result)
    rescue
      e -> render(conn, "error.html", error: e)
    end
  end
end
```

In this (highly contrived) example, a user could submit Elixir code via a POST request to the `eval_code` action.  The server would then execute this code *without any validation*.

### 4.2. Attack Scenarios

Here are several realistic attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Web Form Input:**  A web application has a form field (perhaps intended for a "calculator" feature or a "custom script" option) that directly feeds user input into `Code.eval_string/1`.  An attacker could submit malicious Elixir code to:
    *   Read sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on a Linux system, configuration files).
    *   Execute system commands (e.g., `System.cmd("rm", ["-rf", "/"])` - **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**).
    *   Access the application's database.
    *   Modify application state.
    *   Launch denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Install backdoors.

*   **Scenario 2: API Parameter Injection:** An API endpoint accepts a parameter that is later used in dynamic code evaluation.  An attacker could craft a malicious API request to inject code.

*   **Scenario 3: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:**  If an application deserializes data (e.g., from JSON, YAML, or a custom format) and that data contains a string that is later passed to `Code.eval_string/1`, an attacker could control the executed code.

*   **Scenario 4: Indirect Calls through Libraries:** A seemingly safe library function might internally use `Code.eval_string/1` or `Code.eval_quoted/1` in a way that is vulnerable to user input.  This is less likely with well-vetted libraries, but custom or less-maintained libraries could be a risk.

* **Scenario 5: Configuration Files:** If an application loads configuration from a file, and that file is editable by an attacker (e.g., due to misconfigured permissions), the attacker could inject Elixir code into the configuration file, which would then be executed when the application starts or reloads its configuration.

### 4.3. Likelihood and Impact Assessment

*   **Likelihood:**  While the attack tree lists the likelihood as "Low," this is highly dependent on the application's design.  If an application *intentionally* provides a feature that involves executing user-provided code, the likelihood is much higher.  However, in most well-designed applications, there should be no legitimate reason to directly use user input in `Code.eval_string/1`.  Therefore, the *accidental* introduction of this vulnerability is relatively low, but the *intentional* (but misguided) use is a significant concern.

*   **Impact:**  The impact is correctly assessed as "High."  Successful exploitation grants the attacker *complete control* over the application and potentially the underlying server.  This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, and other severe consequences.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

*   **1. Avoid Dynamic Code Evaluation (Primary Mitigation):**  This is the most crucial mitigation.  Re-evaluate the application's design to eliminate the need for dynamic code evaluation.  Consider alternative approaches:
    *   **For calculations:** Use a dedicated math library or parser instead of evaluating arbitrary expressions.
    *   **For custom logic:**  Implement a domain-specific language (DSL) or a scripting language with limited capabilities (e.g., a sandboxed environment).  Consider using a rules engine.
    *   **For configuration:** Use a standard configuration format (e.g., JSON, YAML) and validate the configuration data against a schema.

*   **2. Input Sanitization and Validation (If Unavoidable):**  If dynamic code evaluation is *absolutely* necessary (and you've exhausted all other options), implement rigorous input sanitization and validation.  This is extremely difficult to do correctly and should be considered a last resort.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Define a very strict whitelist of allowed characters and reject any input that contains characters outside this whitelist.  This is often impractical for Elixir code.
    *   **Parse and Validate the AST:**  Instead of directly evaluating the string, parse it into an Elixir Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using `Code.string_to_quoted/2`.  Then, *thoroughly* inspect the AST to ensure it only contains allowed operations and values.  This is complex and requires a deep understanding of the Elixir AST.  You would need to recursively traverse the AST and check each node.
    *   **Limit Execution Time and Resources:** Use timeouts and resource limits to prevent malicious code from consuming excessive resources or running indefinitely.  Elixir's `:timer.kill_after/2` can be used for timeouts.

*   **3. Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the Elixir application with the minimum necessary operating system privileges.  Do *not* run the application as root.  Use a dedicated user account with restricted access to files, network resources, and system commands.  Consider using containers (e.g., Docker) to further isolate the application.

*   **4. Sandboxing (Advanced):**  Explore the possibility of running the dynamically evaluated code in a sandboxed environment.  This is a complex undertaking, but it can provide an additional layer of security.  There are no readily available, production-ready sandboxing solutions for Elixir, so this would likely involve significant custom development.  Potential approaches include:
    *   **Separate Process:**  Spawn a separate Elixir process with severely restricted capabilities.  Communicate with this process using inter-process communication (IPC).
    *   **Operating System-Level Sandboxing:**  Use operating system features like seccomp (Linux) or AppArmor to restrict the system calls that the Elixir process can make.

*   **5. Code Audits and Static Analysis:**
    *   **Manual Code Review:**  Regularly review code for any use of `Code.eval_string/1`, `Code.eval_quoted/1`, and related functions.  Pay close attention to how user input is handled.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools like `Sobelow` (specifically designed for Phoenix security) and `Credo` (a general-purpose Elixir linter) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Configure these tools to flag any use of dynamic code evaluation functions.  Sobelow has specific checks for code execution vulnerabilities.

*   **6. Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to send a wide range of unexpected inputs to the application and monitor for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior.  This can help identify code injection vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing on the application.  They will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, including code injection, to assess the application's security posture.

*   **7. Dependency Management:**  Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities in libraries.  Use tools like `mix deps.audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.

* **8. Logging and Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity. Log any attempts to use dynamic code evaluation functions, even if they are blocked. Monitor for unusual system resource usage or network traffic.

### 4.5. Detection Methods

*   **Static Analysis (Automated):**
    *   `sobelow --skip-csp --only code-execution` (Phoenix specific, highly recommended)
    *   `credo --strict` (General Elixir linter, can be configured to flag `Code.eval_string`)
    *   Custom scripts to grep for `Code.eval_string`, `Code.eval_quoted`, etc.

*   **Dynamic Analysis (Manual/Automated):**
    *   Fuzzing tools (e.g., `AFL`, `libFuzzer`)
    *   Penetration testing tools (e.g., `Burp Suite`, `OWASP ZAP`)
    *   Manual testing with crafted inputs

*   **Code Review (Manual):**
    *   Focused code reviews targeting areas where user input is handled.
    *   Pair programming to catch potential vulnerabilities early.

### 4.6. Developer Guidance

*   **Never trust user input.**  Treat all user input as potentially malicious.
*   **Avoid dynamic code evaluation whenever possible.**  Find alternative solutions.
*   **If dynamic code evaluation is unavoidable, use extreme caution.**  Implement multiple layers of defense, including input validation, sandboxing, and least privilege.
*   **Stay informed about security best practices.**  Follow security blogs, attend conferences, and participate in the Elixir security community.
*   **Use static analysis tools and code reviews to catch vulnerabilities early.**
*   **Regularly update dependencies.**
* **Document any use of dynamic code evaluation.** Clearly explain the rationale and the security measures taken.

## 5. Conclusion

The `Code.eval_string/1` vulnerability in Elixir applications is a serious threat that can lead to complete system compromise.  While the likelihood of accidental introduction might be low in well-designed applications, the potential impact is extremely high.  The best mitigation is to avoid dynamic code evaluation entirely.  If it is absolutely necessary, a multi-layered approach to security, including rigorous input validation, sandboxing, and least privilege, is essential.  Regular code audits, static analysis, and dynamic testing are crucial for identifying and preventing this vulnerability. Developers must be educated about the risks and follow secure coding practices to minimize the likelihood of introducing this vulnerability.
