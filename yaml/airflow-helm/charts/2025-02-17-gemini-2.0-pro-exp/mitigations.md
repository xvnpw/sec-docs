# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for airflow-helm/charts

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Chart Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_chart_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Monitoring Process:** Set up a system (e.g., a scheduled task, a script, or a dedicated tool) to check the `airflow-helm/charts` GitHub repository for new releases. This could be a simple script that runs weekly and checks the "Releases" page.
    2.  **Review Changelog and Release Notes:** When a new release is detected, *carefully* read the changelog and release notes. Pay close attention to any entries mentioning security fixes, vulnerability patches, or breaking changes *specifically related to the chart itself or its bundled components*.
    3.  **Update Dependencies:** Before upgrading the main chart, run `helm dependency update` to ensure that any sub-charts or dependent charts (those *included within* the `airflow-helm/charts` package) are also updated to compatible versions. This is crucial because vulnerabilities can exist in these dependencies.
    4.  **Test in a Non-Production Environment:** Create a staging or development environment that mirrors your production setup as closely as possible. Deploy the updated chart to this environment *first*.
    5.  **Thorough Testing:** Run comprehensive tests in the staging environment, including functional tests, integration tests, and performance tests. Verify that all Airflow components are working as expected and that there are no regressions *caused by the chart update*.
    6.  **Production Deployment:** Once testing is successful, deploy the updated chart to your production environment. Use a rolling update strategy (if supported by your Kubernetes setup) to minimize downtime.
    7.  **Automate (CI/CD):** Integrate the update process into your CI/CD pipeline. This should include automated checks for new releases, dependency updates, testing, and deployment. The automation should specifically target the Helm chart.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Chart Logic (Severity: High):** Older chart versions might contain bugs or misconfigurations *within the chart's templates or scripts* that could be exploited by attackers.  Regular updates ensure you're using the latest, most secure version of the *chart itself*.
    *   **Outdated Dependencies (Severity: Medium to High):** The chart relies on other components (e.g., Docker images specified *within* the chart, sub-charts).  Outdated dependencies *bundled with the chart* might have known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Missed Security Patches (Severity: High):**  The chart maintainers might release patches specifically to address security issues *in the chart's configuration or deployment logic*.  Failing to update means you're missing these critical fixes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Chart Logic:** Risk reduction: High.  Updates directly address these vulnerabilities *within the chart*.
    *   **Outdated Dependencies:** Risk reduction: Medium to High.  Updates bring in newer, patched dependencies *as defined by the chart*.
    *   **Missed Security Patches:** Risk reduction: High.  Updates apply the necessary patches *to the chart*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   Manual checks for new releases are performed monthly.
    *   Basic testing is done in a staging environment.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated monitoring of the chart repository.
    *   Integration with CI/CD for automated chart updates and testing.
    *   Comprehensive testing suite (including performance and security-specific tests) focused on chart changes.
    *   Formalized process for reviewing changelogs and release notes, specifically looking for chart-related security issues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict `values.yaml` Configuration (Chart-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict__values_yaml__configuration__chart-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Least Privilege (Chart Resources):** Review each setting in `values.yaml` that controls resource allocation or permissions *defined by the chart*. Ensure that it grants only the *minimum* necessary permissions to the components *deployed by the chart*. Avoid using default values that are overly permissive. Focus on settings that affect the behavior of the chart's templates.
    2.  **Secrets Management (Chart Integration):**
        *   Identify all sensitive values used *within the chart's templates* (passwords, API keys, etc.).
        *   Choose a secrets management solution (Kubernetes Secrets, Vault, etc.).
        *   Replace hardcoded secrets in `values.yaml` with references to the secrets management solution, using the *mechanisms provided by the chart* for integrating with secret stores.
        *   Configure Airflow (via the chart's settings) to retrieve secrets from the chosen solution.
        *   Implement a process for regularly rotating secrets, ensuring the chart's configuration is updated to use the new secrets.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Chart Features:**
        *   Identify any features *provided by the chart* in `values.yaml` that are not required (e.g., Flower, certain executors, optional components).
        *   Disable these features *using the chart's configuration options* to reduce the attack surface. This directly reduces the complexity of the deployed resources.
    4.  **Configuration as Code (Chart Focus):**
        *   Store `values.yaml` in a version control system (e.g., Git).
        *   Use a linter or validator (e.g., `kubeval`, `conftest`) to check for common misconfigurations *specifically related to the chart's schema and expected values*.
        *   Implement a code review process (e.g., pull requests) for any changes to `values.yaml`, focusing on the security implications of chart-specific settings.
    5. **Avoid default passwords (Chart-Provided):**
        *   Identify all default passwords *set by the chart*.
        *   Generate strong, random passwords for each component *managed by the chart*.
        *   Store these passwords securely using a secrets management solution.
        *   Configure the chart (via `values.yaml`) to use the new passwords, leveraging the chart's built-in mechanisms for password management.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):**  Misconfigured permissions or exposed secrets *within the chart's deployment* can allow attackers to gain access to Airflow.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):**  Exposed secrets or weak authentication *configured through the chart* can lead to data breaches.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):**  Overly permissive chart configurations can allow attackers to escalate their privileges within the cluster.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Severity: Medium):** Mistakes in `values.yaml` specific to the chart can lead to instability or security vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Threats:** Risk reduction: High.  Strict configuration of the chart itself is fundamental to securing the deployment.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Hypothetical)
    *   `values.yaml` is stored in Git.
    *   Kubernetes Secrets are used for *some* sensitive values, configured through the chart.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive use of a dedicated secrets management solution, fully integrated with the chart's configuration.
    *   Configuration validation using linters, specifically targeting the chart's schema.
    *   Formal code review process for `values.yaml` changes, with a focus on chart-specific security.
    *   Disabling all unnecessary features *provided by the chart*.
    *   Automated secret rotation, coordinated with the chart's configuration.
