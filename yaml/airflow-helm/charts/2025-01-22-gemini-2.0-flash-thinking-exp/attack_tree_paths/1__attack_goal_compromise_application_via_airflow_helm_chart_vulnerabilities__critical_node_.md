**Attack Goal:** Compromise Application via Airflow Helm Chart Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities introduced or not mitigated by the `airflow-helm/charts` Helm chart to gain unauthorized access and control over the Airflow application and/or its underlying infrastructure.

*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Successful compromise can lead to severe consequences, including:
    *   **Data Breaches:** Access to sensitive data managed by Airflow, including connection details, variables, logs, and potentially data processed by DAGs.
    *   **Service Disruption:**  Disruption of critical workflows managed by Airflow, leading to business impact.
    *   **Malicious Workflow Execution:**  Manipulation of DAGs or creation of malicious DAGs to perform unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, or further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Using compromised Airflow components as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.
    *   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust and reputational harm due to security incidents.

*   **Mitigation:** Implement the detailed mitigations outlined below for each potential attack vector.

**Detailed Breakdown of Potential Attack Vectors and Mitigations:**

To achieve the goal of compromising the application via Helm chart vulnerabilities, an attacker might exploit the following attack vectors:

**4.1. Exploiting Default Configurations and Secrets:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The Helm chart might deploy Airflow components with default, weak, or hardcoded secrets (e.g., database passwords, Fernet key, broker credentials). Attackers could discover these defaults through public documentation, code analysis, or by directly accessing the deployed Kubernetes secrets if RBAC is misconfigured.

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Use of default or weak secrets.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Gaining unauthorized access to Airflow components (e.g., database, broker, webserver) using default credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the affected component and potentially the entire Airflow application.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strong Secret Generation:**  **[CRITICAL]** Ensure the Helm chart *forces* the generation of strong, unique secrets for all components during deployment.  Avoid default secrets in the chart's `values.yaml` or templates.
        *   **External Secret Management:** **[RECOMMENDED]** Integrate with external secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and retrieve secrets dynamically. The Helm chart should support and encourage this approach.
        *   **Secret Rotation:** **[BEST PRACTICE]** Implement a process for regular secret rotation for all Airflow components.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (RBAC):** **[CRITICAL]**  Enforce strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to limit access to secrets only to authorized components and users.

**4.2. Insecure Default RBAC and Permissions:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The Helm chart might deploy Airflow components with overly permissive RBAC roles and permissions within Kubernetes. This could allow unauthorized access to Airflow pods, services, secrets, or other Kubernetes resources.

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Overly permissive default RBAC configurations.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Gaining unauthorized access to Airflow components or Kubernetes resources by exploiting weak RBAC policies.
    *   **Impact:**  Lateral movement within the Kubernetes cluster, access to sensitive data, and potential control over Airflow components.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Least Privilege RBAC:** **[CRITICAL]**  Review and configure RBAC roles and role bindings deployed by the Helm chart to adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant only the necessary permissions to each component.
        *   **Namespace Isolation:** **[RECOMMENDED]** Deploy Airflow in a dedicated Kubernetes namespace to limit the blast radius of a potential compromise.
        *   **Regular RBAC Audits:** **[BEST PRACTICE]** Periodically audit RBAC configurations to ensure they remain secure and aligned with the principle of least privilege.

**4.3. Exposed Services and Network Policies:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The Helm chart might expose Airflow services (e.g., Webserver, Flower) publicly or to a wider network than necessary.  Lack of proper network policies could allow unauthorized network access to Airflow components.

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Unnecessarily exposed services and lack of network segmentation.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Direct access to Airflow services from untrusted networks, potentially bypassing authentication or exploiting vulnerabilities in exposed services.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to Airflow UI, API, and other services, leading to potential data breaches, service disruption, and malicious actions.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Restrict Service Exposure:** **[CRITICAL]**  Configure Kubernetes Services to be of type `ClusterIP` by default and expose them only internally within the cluster. Use Ingress controllers or Kubernetes Network Policies to control external access and enforce network segmentation.
        *   **Network Policies:** **[CRITICAL]** Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network traffic between Airflow components and between Airflow and other namespaces/networks. Follow the principle of least privilege for network access.
        *   **Ingress Controller Security:** **[RECOMMENDED]** If exposing the Airflow Webserver externally, use a secure Ingress controller with features like TLS termination, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and rate limiting.
        *   **Service Mesh (Optional):** **[BEST PRACTICE]** Consider using a service mesh for enhanced network security, mutual TLS (mTLS), and fine-grained traffic control within the Airflow deployment.

**4.4. Vulnerable Dependencies and Container Images:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The container images used by the Helm chart might contain known vulnerabilities in their base operating system, Airflow dependencies, or other included software. Outdated images or lack of regular image updates can exacerbate this risk.

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Vulnerabilities in container images.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in container images to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code within Airflow pods.
    *   **Impact:**  Container escape, privilege escalation, and compromise of Airflow components and potentially the underlying Kubernetes node.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   ** নিয়মিত Image Scanning:** **[CRITICAL]** Implement automated container image scanning for vulnerabilities as part of the CI/CD pipeline and regularly scan running images in the Kubernetes cluster.
        *   **Up-to-date Images:** **[CRITICAL]** Ensure the Helm chart uses up-to-date and actively maintained base images and Airflow versions. Regularly update the Helm chart and redeploy to incorporate security patches.
        *   **Minimal Images:** **[RECOMMENDED]**  Use minimal container images to reduce the attack surface and the number of potential vulnerabilities. Consider using distroless images where appropriate.
        *   **Image Provenance and Signing:** **[BEST PRACTICE]**  Verify the provenance and integrity of container images used by the Helm chart through image signing and verification mechanisms.

**4.5. Misconfigured SecurityContext:**

*   **Attack Vector:** The Helm chart might not properly configure the `securityContext` for Airflow pods, potentially allowing containers to run with excessive privileges (e.g., running as root, allowing privilege escalation).

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Insecure `securityContext` configurations.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Container escape, privilege escalation, and easier exploitation of vulnerabilities within containers due to elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of Airflow components and potentially the underlying Kubernetes node.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Restrictive SecurityContext:** **[CRITICAL]**  Configure the `securityContext` for all Airflow pods to enforce security best practices:
            *   `runAsNonRoot: true` - Run containers as a non-root user.
            *   `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` - Make the root filesystem read-only (where applicable).
            *   `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` - Prevent containers from gaining more privileges.
            *   `capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]` - Drop all unnecessary Linux capabilities.
        *   **Pod Security Admission (PSA):** **[RECOMMENDED]**  Enforce Pod Security Admission (PSA) at the namespace level to prevent the deployment of pods that violate security best practices, including `securityContext` configurations.

**4.6. Lack of Resource Limits and Quotas:**

*   **Attack Vector:**  The Helm chart might not define or enforce resource limits and quotas for Airflow pods. This could allow a compromised component or a malicious actor to consume excessive resources, leading to denial-of-service (DoS) or resource exhaustion for other components or applications in the cluster.

    *   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of resource limits and quotas.
    *   **Exploitation:**  Resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Impact:**  Service disruption and potential instability of the Airflow application and the Kubernetes cluster.

    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Resource Limits and Requests:** **[CRITICAL]**  Define appropriate resource limits and requests (CPU and memory) for all Airflow pods in the Helm chart.
        *   **Resource Quotas:** **[RECOMMENDED]**  Implement Kubernetes Resource Quotas at the namespace level to limit the total resources that can be consumed by the Airflow deployment.
        *   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA):** **[BEST PRACTICE]**  Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to automatically scale Airflow components based on resource utilization, improving resilience and preventing resource exhaustion.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**
