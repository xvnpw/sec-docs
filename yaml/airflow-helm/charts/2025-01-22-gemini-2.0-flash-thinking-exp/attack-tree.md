## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Airflow Helm Chart Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_goal_compromise_application_via_airflow_helm_chart_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the overall objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access and control over the Airflow application and/or its infrastructure.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:**  Represents the ultimate negative outcome. Successful compromise can lead to data breaches, service disruption, and malicious workflow execution.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement all mitigations outlined in the detailed breakdown below to reduce the likelihood of reaching this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misconfigurations in Chart Deployment (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misconfigurations_in_chart_deployment__and___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses arising from how the Helm chart is configured and deployed. This path relies on misconfigurations being present in the deployed application.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Misconfigurations are common, especially if default settings are insecure or users lack security expertise. This path can lead to direct and easily exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Harden default chart configurations.
    *   Provide clear documentation and guidance on secure configuration.
    *   Automate configuration validation and security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Insecure Default Configurations (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3__insecure_default_configurations__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging insecure settings that are pre-configured in the Helm chart's `values.yaml` or templates and are not changed during deployment.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Default configurations are often prioritized for ease of use over security. Users may overlook changing these defaults, leaving easily exploitable weaknesses.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Design charts with secure defaults.
    *   Force or strongly encourage users to change default passwords and sensitive settings.
    *   Provide security hardening guides and best practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exposed Services with Default Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exposed_services_with_default_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Services like the Airflow UI, databases, or message brokers are exposed to the network (potentially publicly) with default, well-known credentials.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:**  Extremely easy to exploit. Attackers can quickly gain access using readily available default credentials.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Airflow UI Exposed with Default Admin Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Airflow UI is accessible, and the default admin username/password (`airflow`/`airflow`) is not changed.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:**  Critical impact (full control of Airflow), medium likelihood (common oversight), very low effort/skill.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Force password change during initial setup.
            *   Generate random default admin password and store securely.
            *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   **Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) Exposed with Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Database service is network-accessible, and default database credentials are used.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Critical impact (data breach, infrastructure access), low likelihood (less common to expose DB directly, but possible), low effort/skill.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Never use default database credentials in production.
            *   Force strong, unique password configuration.
            *   Restrict database access to only Airflow components using NetworkPolicies.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. User-Introduced Misconfigurations (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/5__user-introduced_misconfigurations__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Users deploying the chart introduce security weaknesses through their configuration choices, often due to lack of security awareness or best practices.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** User errors are a significant source of vulnerabilities. Even with secure defaults, users can misconfigure the application.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Weak Passwords/Secrets in `values.yaml` or Secrets Management (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Users store weak passwords or secrets directly in `values.yaml` or use insecure secrets management practices.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Critical impact (direct credential compromise), medium likelihood (common user error), low effort/skill.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Strongly discourage** storing secrets in `values.yaml`.
            *   Provide clear documentation and examples on using Kubernetes Secrets, external secret managers, and Helm's secret management features.
            *   Implement validation to detect secrets in `values.yaml`.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Chart Dependencies (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_chart_dependencies__and___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the container images or other dependencies used by the Helm chart.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Dependencies are a common source of vulnerabilities. Outdated or vulnerable components can be easily exploited if not managed properly.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Vulnerable Container Images (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Outdated Base Images (OS Level Vulnerabilities) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Base OS images in containers are outdated and contain known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Why it's High-Risk:** High impact (OS-level vulnerabilities, container escape potential), medium likelihood (images can become outdated quickly), medium effort/skill.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Regularly update base images to the latest stable versions.
                *   Implement automated image scanning and vulnerability management.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Airflow Core Image (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities exist in the Airflow core container image itself.
            *   **Why it's High-Risk:** High impact (application-level vulnerabilities, RCE potential), low likelihood (Airflow project is maintained), medium effort/skill.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Monitor Airflow project for security advisories.
                *   Update Airflow version in the chart promptly when vulnerabilities are patched.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Database Image (PostgreSQL/MySQL) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities exist in the database container image.
            *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Critical impact (database compromise, data breach), low likelihood (database projects are maintained), medium effort/skill.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Monitor database projects for security advisories.
                *   Update database versions in the chart promptly.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Chart Acquisition (Less Direct, but Relevant) (AND) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/7__supply_chain_attacks_targeting_chart_acquisition__less_direct__but_relevant___and___critical_node_f71afb71.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the supply chain of the Helm chart itself, leading to the distribution of malicious charts.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Supply chain attacks can be very impactful and difficult to detect. A compromised chart can lead to widespread compromise of deployments.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Compromised Helm Chart Repository (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Downloading Chart from Unofficial or Compromised Repository (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Users download the Helm chart from an unofficial or compromised repository, unknowingly installing a malicious chart.
            *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Critical impact (full compromise), low likelihood (users generally use official repos), medium effort/skill for attacker.
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   **Always** download Helm charts from trusted and official repositories (e.g., `https://airflow.apache.org/`).
                *   Verify chart integrity using signatures if available.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Chart Download (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts the chart download process (MITM) and injects a malicious chart.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Critical impact (full compromise), very low likelihood (HTTPS is widely used), high effort/skill for attacker.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Always** use HTTPS for Helm repository access.
            *   Implement chart integrity verification mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. RBAC Disabled or Misconfigured (Kubernetes Level) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/8__rbac_disabled_or_misconfigured__kubernetes_level___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is disabled or misconfigured, allowing excessive permissions to Airflow components or attackers who compromise a component.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** High impact (potential cluster-wide compromise), very low likelihood (RBAC is usually enabled), medium effort/skill.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Ensure RBAC is enabled in the chart's deployment manifests.
    *   Define minimal RBAC roles and rolebindings for Airflow components, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit RBAC configurations.
