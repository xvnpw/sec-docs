# Project Design Document: Airflow Helm Charts Deployment (Improved)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced design overview of a system deployed using the Airflow Helm Charts project from [https://github.com/airflow-helm/charts](https://github.com/airflow-helm/charts). Building upon the initial design, this improved version offers greater detail and a stronger focus on security considerations, making it more effective as a foundation for threat modeling activities. It outlines the system architecture, key components, data flow, and security aspects relevant to a typical Airflow deployment on Kubernetes using these Helm charts, specifically emphasizing potential vulnerabilities and security best practices.

## 2. System Overview

The Airflow Helm Charts project simplifies and standardizes the deployment of Apache Airflow, a workflow orchestration platform, on a Kubernetes cluster. These charts offer a highly configurable and scalable method for deploying Airflow and its dependencies, leveraging Kubernetes' inherent orchestration and resource management capabilities.

This design document continues to focus on a common deployment scenario utilizing the Celery Executor, PostgreSQL database for metadata, and Redis for both caching and as the Celery message broker. While the Helm charts offer extensive customization options, this document will maintain its focus on a representative and widely used architecture to ensure clarity and relevance for threat modeling.

## 3. System Architecture

The system architecture remains microservices-based, with Airflow components deployed as distinct Kubernetes deployments and services. External access is typically managed via a Kubernetes Ingress or LoadBalancer, providing controlled entry points to the system.

**Components (Detailed):**

*   **Kubernetes Cluster:** The foundational infrastructure providing container orchestration, resource management, and a platform for deploying and managing the Airflow system. Security of the Kubernetes cluster itself is paramount.
*   **Namespace: airflow:** A dedicated Kubernetes namespace serves as a logical boundary, isolating Airflow resources and improving security by limiting the blast radius of potential security incidents.
*   **Airflow Components (Security Focused Descriptions):**
    *   **Webserver:** The user-facing interface, handling user authentication, DAG management, and visualization.  It's a critical component from a security perspective as it's exposed externally and handles user interactions. Vulnerabilities here could lead to unauthorized access and control.
    *   **Scheduler:** The brain of Airflow, responsible for DAG parsing, scheduling, and task orchestration. Compromise of the scheduler could disrupt workflow execution and potentially lead to unauthorized task execution.
    *   **Worker(s):** The execution engines for Airflow tasks. Workers execute code defined in DAGs, making them a key target for malicious DAGs or code injection attacks. Worker security is crucial to prevent unauthorized actions and data breaches.
    *   **Flower:** A Celery monitoring tool, providing insights into worker and task status. While primarily for monitoring, if exposed without proper authentication, it could reveal sensitive operational information.
    *   **Triggerer:** (Optional, depending on Airflow version and configuration)  Handles event-based DAG triggering.  If misconfigured or vulnerable, it could be exploited to trigger unintended DAG runs or bypass scheduling controls.
*   **Supporting Services (Security Focused Descriptions):**
    *   **PostgreSQL Database:** Stores all Airflow metadata, including sensitive information like connections, variables, and user credentials (if local authentication is used). Database security is paramount as it's the central repository of Airflow's operational data.
    *   **Redis:** Used as a message broker for Celery and potentially for caching. If not secured, Redis could be exploited to intercept or manipulate task messages, or to access cached data.
    *   **Ingress / LoadBalancer:** The entry point for external traffic to the Webserver and Flower.  It's a critical security boundary and must be properly configured to handle TLS termination, access control, and protection against web attacks.
*   **Persistent Storage (Security Focused Descriptions):**
    *   **Persistent Volume Claim (Logs):** Stores task logs, which can contain sensitive data depending on the workflows. Access control and secure storage of logs are important for data confidentiality and auditability.
    *   **Persistent Volume Claim (DAGs):** Stores DAG files, which define workflows and can contain sensitive configurations, credentials, or business logic. Protecting DAG storage from unauthorized access and modification is crucial.
