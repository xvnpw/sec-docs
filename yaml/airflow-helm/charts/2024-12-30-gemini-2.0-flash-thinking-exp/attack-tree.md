**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Webserver Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** This path involves an attacker gaining access to the Airflow webserver, which is made publicly accessible due to the default service type or misconfiguration. Once accessed, the attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the Airflow webserver software itself, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Sequence of Actions:**
    *   Attacker identifies an exposed Airflow webserver.
    *   Attacker researches and identifies known vulnerabilities for the specific Airflow version.
    *   Attacker crafts and executes an exploit targeting the identified vulnerability.
*   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the Airflow installation and potentially the underlying infrastructure, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt operations.

**High-Risk Path: Leverage Insecure Default Configurations**

*   **Attack Vector:** This path relies on the common practice of deploying the Airflow Helm chart with default configuration values. These default configurations often include weak or default credentials for administrative accounts or database access.
*   **Sequence of Actions:**
    *   Attacker identifies an Airflow installation likely deployed with default settings.
    *   Attacker attempts to log in using known default credentials for the Airflow webserver or database.
*   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker administrative access to the Airflow webserver, allowing them to manage DAGs, connections, and potentially execute code. Access to the database allows for direct manipulation or exfiltration of sensitive information.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Exposed Services Due to Incorrect Service Types**

*   **Attack Vector:** This path occurs when the Helm chart is configured (or left at its default in some cases) to expose internal services like the Airflow webserver directly to the public internet using service types like `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` without proper security measures (like authentication or network restrictions).
*   **Sequence of Actions:**
    *   Attacker scans for publicly accessible services on the target Kubernetes cluster.
    *   Attacker identifies an exposed Airflow webserver or other vulnerable service.
    *   Attacker directly interacts with the exposed service to exploit vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Potential Impact:** Exposing the webserver directly bypasses typical ingress controls and makes it a prime target for web application attacks. Exposing other services like the database or Redis directly can lead to data breaches or manipulation.

**Critical Node: Access Exposed Webserver (Default Service Type: LoadBalancer/NodePort)**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the initial exposure of the Airflow webserver to the internet due to the Kubernetes service configuration.
*   **Why Critical:**  A publicly accessible webserver significantly increases the attack surface, making it easier for attackers to discover and target the application. It's a prerequisite for exploiting webserver vulnerabilities.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Opens the door for web application attacks, brute-force attempts, and exploitation of known Airflow vulnerabilities.

**Critical Node: Exploit Known Airflow Webserver Vulnerabilities (e.g., Unauthenticated RCE, SSRF)**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the exploitation of specific security flaws within the Airflow webserver software.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful exploitation can grant the attacker complete control over the Airflow installation, allowing for arbitrary code execution and access to sensitive data.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Full application compromise, data breaches, service disruption, and potential lateral movement within the infrastructure.

**Critical Node: Exploit Weak Default Credentials (e.g., default admin password, database passwords)**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the exploitation of default or easily guessable credentials that are often present in default configurations.
*   **Why Critical:** It's a low-effort, high-reward attack that can grant immediate administrative access to critical components.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Full control over the Airflow webserver, access to sensitive data in the database, and the ability to manipulate workflows.

**Critical Node: Chart Deploys Services with Publicly Accessible Service Types (e.g., LoadBalancer, NodePort) without Proper Security**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents a misconfiguration in the Kubernetes service definition within the Helm chart, leading to unintended public exposure of internal services.
*   **Why Critical:** It directly exposes internal components to the internet, bypassing typical security controls and making them vulnerable to direct attacks.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Exposure of the webserver, database, or other internal services, leading to potential compromise and data breaches.

**Critical Node: Exploit Scheduler Logic (e.g., Inject Malicious DAGs, Manipulate Task Queues)**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the exploitation of the Airflow scheduler's functionality to execute malicious tasks or disrupt workflows.
*   **Why Critical:** The scheduler controls the execution of all Airflow tasks, making it a powerful target for attackers.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Execution of arbitrary code on worker nodes, manipulation of data pipelines, and disruption of critical workflows.

**Critical Node: Access Database Credentials (Potentially Stored as Kubernetes Secrets)**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the unauthorized retrieval of database credentials, often stored as Kubernetes Secrets.
*   **Why Critical:** Database credentials provide direct access to sensitive data stored within the Airflow database.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Data breaches, data manipulation, and potential compromise of other systems that rely on the same database.

**Critical Node: Exploit Database Server (e.g., SQL Injection via DAG parameters, Unpatched Vulnerabilities)**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the database server itself, often through SQL injection flaws in DAG parameters or unpatched software.
*   **Why Critical:** Direct exploitation of the database can lead to significant data breaches and manipulation.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Data exfiltration, data modification, and potential denial of service.

**Critical Node: Access Sensitive Information (Database Credentials, API Keys)**

*   **Attack Vector:** This node represents the successful retrieval of sensitive information, such as database credentials or API keys, which are often stored as Kubernetes Secrets.
*   **Why Critical:** Access to these secrets grants attackers privileged access to critical resources and systems.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to other services, and the ability to perform actions with elevated privileges.
