## 4. Component Design

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the components deployed by the Helm charts.

### 4.1. Core Airflow Components

* **Webserver:**
    * **Description:** The user interface for Airflow, providing a visual representation of DAGs, task status, logs, and administrative functions.
    * **Kubernetes Resource:** Typically deployed as a `Deployment` or `StatefulSet`.
    * **Functionality:** Serves the Airflow UI, handles user authentication (configurable through various backend options), and interacts with the metadata database (PostgreSQL). It also exposes metrics for monitoring.
    * **Configuration:** Configurable through Helm values for replica count, resource requests/limits, authentication settings, and UI customizations.
* **Scheduler:**
    * **Description:** The brain of Airflow, responsible for parsing DAG files, scheduling tasks based on defined schedules and dependencies, and triggering task execution.
    * **Kubernetes Resource:** Usually deployed as a single replica `Deployment` or `StatefulSet` for leader election.
    * **Functionality:** Continuously monitors DAG definitions, updates task states in the metadata database, and communicates with workers to execute tasks.
    * **Configuration:** Configurable through Helm values for resource requests/limits, scheduler-specific settings, and DAG synchronization parameters.
* **Worker(s):**
    * **Description:** Executes the individual tasks defined within DAGs. Workers pull tasks from a queue (e.g., Celery) or are directly invoked by the scheduler (e.g., Kubernetes Executor).
    * **Kubernetes Resource:** Deployed as a `Deployment` or `StatefulSet`, scalable based on workload demands.
    * **Functionality:** Receives task execution requests, executes the defined operations, and reports task status back to the scheduler.

    subgraph "Airflow Operations"
        direction LR
        A["'User'"]
        B["'Webserver'"]
        C["'Scheduler'"]
        D["'Worker'"]
        E["'PostgreSQL'"]
        F["'Redis'"]
        G["'DAG Files (Persistent Volume)'"]
        H["'Task Logs (Persistent Volume)'"]

        A -- \"View UI, Trigger DAGs\" --> B
        B -- \"Read/Write Metadata\" --> E
        C -- \"Read DAGs\" --> G
        C -- \"Schedule Tasks\" --> E
        C -- \"Queue Tasks (Celery)\" --> F
        C -- \"Direct Task Execution (Kubernetes Executor)\" --> D
        D -- \"Execute Tasks\" --> I["External Systems"]
        D -- \"Write Logs\" --> H
        D -- \"Update Task Status\" --> E
    end
```

**Key Data Flows:**

* **DAG Definition and Loading:** DAG files are typically stored in a persistent volume accessible by the scheduler, which parses them to understand the workflow.
* **User Interaction and Control:** Users interact with the webserver to view DAGs, trigger runs, manage connections, and monitor task status.
* **Scheduling and Task Assignment:** The scheduler reads DAG definitions, schedules tasks based on dependencies and schedules, and updates the metadata database. It then assigns tasks to workers (via Redis for Celery or directly for Kubernetes Executor).
* **Task Execution:** Workers receive task execution requests and execute the defined operations, interacting with external systems as needed.
* **Metadata Management:** All core Airflow state, including DAG definitions, task status, and connection details, is stored and managed in the PostgreSQL database.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Task logs are written to a persistent volume for auditing and debugging. Metrics are collected by Prometheus (potentially via the StatsD exporter) for monitoring and alerting.

## 6. Security Considerations

This section highlights crucial security considerations for the Airflow deployment using these Helm charts, forming the basis for threat modeling.

* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Webserver Authentication:**  Implementing robust authentication mechanisms for the Airflow webserver, such as using Flask-AppBuilder with appropriate authentication backends (e.g., database authentication, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
    * **Kubernetes RBAC:**  Strictly defining and enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies within the Kubernetes cluster to limit the permissions of Airflow components and other applications.
    * **Database Access Control:** Securing access to the PostgreSQL database by using strong passwords, network policies, and potentially connection pooling.
    * **Redis Security:**  Securing the Redis instance, potentially using authentication and network segmentation.
* **Network Security:**
    * **Kubernetes Network Policies:** Implementing Network Policies to restrict network traffic between pods and namespaces, limiting potential attack surfaces.
    * **Ingress Security:**  Securing the Ingress resource with TLS/SSL certificates (using HTTPS), implementing authentication at the Ingress level (if needed), and protecting against common web vulnerabilities.
    * **Service Exposure Minimization:**  Avoiding unnecessary exposure of internal services and carefully considering the security implications of any exposed services.
* **Secrets Management:**
    * **Secure Secret Storage:**  Utilizing Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or other secure secret management solutions to store sensitive information like database passwords, API keys, and connection strings. Avoid storing secrets directly in Helm values or environment variables.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for Secrets:**  Granting only the necessary permissions to access secrets to specific components.
* **Data Security:**
    * **Encryption at Rest:**  Encrypting data stored in persistent volumes used by PostgreSQL and potentially for logs, using Kubernetes Secret Encryption or cloud provider encryption features.
    * **Encryption in Transit:**  Ensuring all communication between components and external access uses TLS/SSL encryption.
* **Dependency and Image Security:**
    * **Regular Image Updates:** Regularly updating the base container images used for Airflow components to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Dependency Scanning:**  Implementing processes to scan Python dependencies for vulnerabilities and update them proactively.
    * **Supply Chain Security:**  Verifying the integrity and authenticity of container images and dependencies.
* **Airflow Configuration Hardening:**
    * **Reviewing Default Settings:**  Reviewing and hardening default Airflow configurations, such as disabling insecure features and setting appropriate security headers.
    * **Leveraging Airflow Security Features:**  Utilizing Airflow's built-in security features, such as the Fernet key for encrypting connections and sensitive data.
* **Resource Limits and Quotas:**
    * **Preventing Resource Exhaustion:** Setting appropriate resource limits and requests for pods to prevent denial-of-service attacks and resource contention.
    * **Namespace Quotas:**  Utilizing namespace quotas to limit resource consumption within the Airflow namespace.
* **Pod Security Standards:**
    * **Enforcing Security Best Practices:**  Utilizing Kubernetes Pod Security Admission (replacing Pod Security Policies) to enforce security best practices for pods, such as restricting privileged containers and enforcing read-only root filesystems.

## 7. Deployment Considerations

* **Helm Value Customization:**  Leveraging the extensive configurable parameters within the Helm chart to tailor the deployment to specific needs, including resource allocation, security settings, and feature flags.
* **Namespace Isolation:**  Deploying Airflow in a dedicated Kubernetes namespace to provide logical isolation and improve security.
* **Persistent Storage Configuration:**  Properly configuring persistent volume provisioning and storage classes for stateful components like PostgreSQL and Redis.
* **Executor Selection and Configuration:**  Carefully choosing the appropriate Airflow executor (e.g., Sequential, Local, Celery, Kubernetes) based on workload requirements and infrastructure constraints, and configuring it accordingly.
* **Monitoring and Logging Integration:**  Planning for integration with existing monitoring and logging infrastructure, configuring Prometheus scraping and log forwarding.
* **Upgrade Strategy and Rollbacks:**  Developing a clear strategy for upgrading Airflow versions and the underlying infrastructure, including procedures for rolling back in case of issues.
