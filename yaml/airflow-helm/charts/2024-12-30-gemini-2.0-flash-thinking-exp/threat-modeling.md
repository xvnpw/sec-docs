Here's the updated list of high and critical threats directly involving the `airflow-helm/charts`:

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Default Secrets
    *   **Description:** The `airflow-helm/charts` might deploy components with default, well-known secrets (e.g., for Redis, PostgreSQL if deployed by the chart, or internal Airflow components) that an attacker could exploit if not changed after deployment. This could involve accessing configuration values set by the chart, environment variables defined in the chart's templates, or attempting default credentials on services deployed by the chart.
    *   **Impact:**  Full control over the affected component (e.g., reading/writing to the database, impersonating Airflow components), potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of workflows, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Configuration values within the chart, environment variables defined in the chart's Deployments/StatefulSets (Webserver, Scheduler, Workers), potentially the Redis or PostgreSQL StatefulSets/Deployments if deployed by the chart.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change all default secrets and passwords upon initial deployment using chart values or post-install hooks.
        *   Utilize Kubernetes Secrets for managing sensitive information, ensuring the chart is configured to use existing secrets or create new ones.
        *   Avoid relying on default secret generation within the chart if possible, opting for pre-generated secrets.

*   **Threat:** Secrets Stored Insecurely in ConfigMaps
    *   **Description:** The `airflow-helm/charts` might be configured to store sensitive information (passwords, API keys) in ConfigMaps instead of Kubernetes Secrets. This could be due to default chart configurations or incorrect value overrides. ConfigMaps are not designed for storing sensitive data and are easily accessible within the Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to databases, external services, or the Airflow infrastructure itself.
    *   **Affected Component:** ConfigMap templates within the chart used for configuring Airflow components (Webserver, Scheduler, Workers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the chart values are configured to use Kubernetes Secrets for all sensitive information.
        *   Review the chart's templates and ensure they are not directly embedding secrets in ConfigMaps.
        *   Audit deployed ConfigMaps to identify and migrate any stored secrets to Kubernetes Secrets.

*   **Threat:** Secrets Exposed via Environment Variables
    *   **Description:** The `airflow-helm/charts` might be configured to pass sensitive information as environment variables within container definitions. This can be less secure than using Kubernetes Secrets, especially if not handled carefully within the chart's templates. An attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster could inspect these environment variables.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to databases, external services, or the Airflow infrastructure itself.
    *   **Affected Component:** Pod specifications within the chart's Deployments/StatefulSets templates (Webserver, Scheduler, Workers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the chart to use Kubernetes Secrets mounted as volumes or environment variables via `secretKeyRef` instead of directly embedding secrets in environment variables within the chart's templates.
        *   Review the chart's templates to ensure secrets are not being directly injected as plain text environment variables.

*   **Threat:** Overly Permissive RBAC Roles
    *   **Description:** The `airflow-helm/charts` might create default Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles that grant excessive permissions to the deployed components' service accounts. An attacker who compromises a component could leverage these permissions to perform unauthorized actions within the Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **Impact:**  Privilege escalation within the Kubernetes cluster, potentially leading to control over other namespaces, nodes, or sensitive resources.
    *   **Affected Component:**  RBAC Role and RoleBinding templates within the chart, Service Account definitions within the chart.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review and restrict the permissions granted by the default RBAC roles created by the chart, potentially overriding the default roles with more restrictive ones.
        *   Configure the chart to create custom, more restrictive RBAC roles tailored to the specific needs of each component.

*   **Threat:** Insecure TLS Configuration for Ingress
    *   **Description:** The `airflow-helm/charts` might configure the Ingress resource with a weak TLS configuration (e.g., using outdated protocols or weak ciphers) or might not enforce TLS at all. This could allow an attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between users and the Airflow webserver, including credentials and workflow information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Ingress resource configuration within the chart's templates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the chart values are configured to enforce TLS for all external access points (Ingress).
        *   Configure the chart to use strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites.
        *   Utilize the chart's options for specifying TLS certificates or integrate with certificate management solutions.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Chart Repository or Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially compromise the official `airflow-helm/charts` repository or its dependencies, leading to the distribution of a malicious chart version that deploys vulnerable or malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Deployment of compromised software, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or complete control over the Airflow infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `airflow-helm/charts` itself and any dependent charts or resources it pulls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use the official and verified `airflow-helm/charts` repository.
        *   Implement a process for verifying the integrity of downloaded Helm charts (e.g., using checksums or signatures).
        *   Regularly scan the deployed containers for vulnerabilities, regardless of the source of the chart.
        *   Monitor for any unusual activity or changes in the chart repository.
