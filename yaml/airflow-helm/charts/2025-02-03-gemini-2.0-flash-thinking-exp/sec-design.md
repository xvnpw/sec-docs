# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Airflow Helm Charts, aims to simplify and standardize the deployment of Apache Airflow on Kubernetes. Apache Airflow is a critical platform for orchestrating data pipelines and workflows. Providing well-maintained and configurable Helm charts directly addresses the operational challenges of deploying and managing Airflow in a Kubernetes environment.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Goal 1: Simplify Airflow Deployment on Kubernetes: Reduce the complexity and effort required to deploy and manage Airflow clusters on Kubernetes.
- Goal 2: Provide Customizable Airflow Deployments: Offer flexible configuration options to adapt Airflow deployments to various use cases and organizational needs.
- Goal 3: Ensure Maintainability and Upgradability: Deliver Helm charts that are actively maintained, updated, and easy to upgrade, reducing operational overhead.
- Goal 4: Promote Adoption of Airflow on Kubernetes: Lower the barrier to entry for organizations wanting to leverage Airflow on Kubernetes.

Business Risks:
- Risk 1: Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities: Incorrectly configured Helm charts could introduce security vulnerabilities in deployed Airflow instances, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
- Risk 2: Service Disruption: Issues in the Helm charts or their deployment process could lead to unstable or unavailable Airflow services, impacting critical data pipelines.
- Risk 3: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Dependencies within the Helm charts or the container images they deploy could contain vulnerabilities, compromising the security of Airflow deployments.
- Risk 4: Data Integrity and Confidentiality: If not properly secured, Airflow deployments could expose sensitive workflow definitions, connection details, or data processed by workflows.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Build Process Description:

1. Developer makes changes to the Helm charts, configuration files, or documentation on their local workstation.
2. Code changes are committed and pushed to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
3. Git push triggers the CI/CD pipeline defined in GitHub Actions.
4. Build Process in GitHub Actions:
    - Helm Linting: Checks Helm chart syntax and best practices.
    - Security Scanning: Scans Helm charts for potential security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency Scanning: Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    - Unit and Integration Tests: Executes automated tests to validate chart functionality.
    - Package Chart: Packages the Helm chart into a distributable artifact.
    - Versioning and Tagging: Versions and tags the chart artifact.
    - Publish Chart: Publishes the Helm chart artifact to a Helm chart registry (e.g., GitHub Packages, Artifact Hub).
5. Helm Chart Artifact is stored in the Helm Chart Registry, ready for users to download and deploy.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) - Helm linting tools are used to identify potential misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in Helm charts.
- security control: Dependency Scanning - Automated tools scan chart dependencies and container images for known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Automated Testing - Unit and integration tests are executed to ensure chart functionality and prevent regressions.
- security control: Secure Build Environment - GitHub Actions provides a secure and isolated environment for building and packaging charts.
- security control: Access Control - Access to the Git repository and CI/CD pipeline is controlled via GitHub permissions.
- security control: Chart Signing (Optional) - Helm chart signing can be implemented to ensure chart integrity and provenance (not explicitly mentioned in input, but recommended).
- security control: Version Control - Git is used for version control of the Helm charts, providing traceability and rollback capabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Deployment and Management of Apache Airflow: The primary business process is enabling users to easily and securely deploy and manage Airflow on Kubernetes.
- Workflow Orchestration: Indirectly, the charts support critical business processes that rely on Airflow for workflow orchestration and data pipeline management.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Helm Chart Code: Source code of the Helm charts, including Kubernetes manifests and configuration templates. Sensitivity: Low to Medium (code is generally public, but unauthorized modifications could lead to malicious charts).
- Chart Configuration Values: Default and example configuration values included in the charts. Sensitivity: Low.
- Security Configurations within Charts: Security-related configurations within the charts (e.g., RBAC settings, network policies). Sensitivity: Medium (incorrect configurations could weaken security).
- Container Images Referenced in Charts: Container images used for Airflow components. Sensitivity: Medium (vulnerable images could compromise deployments).
- Helm Chart Artifacts: Packaged Helm charts stored in the chart registry. Sensitivity: Medium (compromised charts could be distributed to users).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the target risk appetite for users of these Helm charts? Are they primarily startups, enterprises, or a mix? This will influence the level of security rigor required.
- Are there specific Kubernetes distributions or cloud providers that are primarily targeted or need to be explicitly supported from a security perspective?
- What are the expected security skills and knowledge of the users deploying these charts? Should the charts be secure by default, or rely on users to implement security best practices?
- Are there existing security tools or processes within the user organizations that these charts should integrate with (e.g., vulnerability scanning, security monitoring)?
- Is Helm chart signing and provenance a requirement for users?

Assumptions:
- Users deploying these Helm charts are aiming to run production workloads of Apache Airflow on Kubernetes.
- Security is a significant concern for users, but ease of use and configurability are also important priorities.
- Users have a basic understanding of Kubernetes and Helm concepts.
- The project aims to provide reasonably secure defaults in the Helm charts, but users are ultimately responsible for securing their own deployments based on their specific requirements and risk tolerance.
- The project will be actively maintained and updated to address security vulnerabilities and incorporate security best practices.
