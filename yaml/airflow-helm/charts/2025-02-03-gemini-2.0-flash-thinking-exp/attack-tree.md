## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Airflow Helm Chart Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_via_airflow_helm_chart_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access and control over the Airflow application and/or its infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the application, potential data breach, service disruption, and infrastructure compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Chart Deployment (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_chart_deployment__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from insecure configurations introduced during the deployment of the Helm chart. This is a broad category encompassing several specific misconfigurations.
*   **Breakdown of Sub-Paths:**

    *   **Insecure Default Configurations (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Description:** Relying on insecure default settings provided by the Helm chart without proper hardening.
        *   **Exposed Services with Default Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   **Airflow UI Exposed with Default Admin Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Airflow UI is publicly accessible and the default admin credentials (`airflow`/`airflow`) are not changed.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** Critical
                *   **Effort:** Very Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
                *   **Action:** Change default admin password immediately. Enforce strong password policies.
            *   **Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) Exposed with Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Database service is publicly accessible or accessible from outside the intended network segment, and default database credentials are used.
                *   **Likelihood:** Low
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Action:** Change default database passwords. Restrict database access to Airflow components only.
        *   **Insecure Network Policies (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   **Allowing Public Access to Internal Services (e.g., Database, Redis, Celery) (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Lack of NetworkPolicies or misconfigured NetworkPolicies allow public or external access to internal services like databases, Redis, or Celery.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Action:** Implement NetworkPolicies to restrict access to internal services within the Kubernetes cluster.
            *   **Overly Permissive Ingress Rules (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Ingress rules are configured too broadly, exposing more services or endpoints than intended, potentially including sensitive internal services.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** Medium
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
                *   **Action:** Review and restrict Ingress rules to only expose necessary services (Airflow UI, potentially API if needed) and enforce proper authentication.
        *   **User-Introduced Misconfigurations (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            *   **Weak Passwords/Secrets in `values.yaml` or Secrets Management (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Users mistakenly store weak passwords or secrets directly in `values.yaml` or use insecure methods for managing secrets, making them easily accessible to attackers.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** Critical
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult
                *   **Action:** Never store secrets directly in `values.yaml`. Utilize Kubernetes Secrets, external secret management solutions (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.), and Helm's secret management features.
