        print("The potential for insecure Ingress configuration stems from the chart's role in automating the deployment of Kubernetes resources. While this automation simplifies setup, it can also lead to security oversights if secure defaults are not enforced or clear guidance is lacking.\n")

        print("**1. Missing TLS Configuration:**")
        print("   - **Vulnerability:** If TLS is not enabled, all traffic between the user's browser and the Airflow webserver is transmitted in plaintext. This includes sensitive data like login credentials, API keys stored in connections, and potentially sensitive data displayed on the UI.")
        print("   - **Exploitation:** Attackers on the network path (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks on public Wi-Fi) can easily intercept this traffic using tools like Wireshark.")
        print("   - **Impact:** Direct exposure of sensitive information, leading to account compromise and potential data breaches.\n")

        print("**2. Weak Cipher Suites:**")
        print("   - **Vulnerability:** Even with TLS enabled, using outdated or weak cipher suites makes the encryption susceptible to cryptanalysis. Modern cryptographic attacks can break these weaker ciphers.")
        print("   - **Exploitation:** Attackers can perform more sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt the traffic if weak ciphers are negotiated.")
        print("   - **Impact:**  Compromise of confidentiality, similar to missing TLS, although requiring more advanced attacker capabilities.\n")

        print("**3. Lack of Rate Limiting:**")
        print("   - **Vulnerability:** Without rate limiting, there are no restrictions on the number of requests an IP address or user can send to the Ingress.")
        print("   - **Exploitation:** Attackers can launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by flooding the Ingress with requests, overwhelming the Airflow webserver and making it unavailable to legitimate users.")
        print("   - **Impact:**  Disruption of Airflow operations, preventing users from accessing the UI to monitor workflows, trigger DAGs, or manage connections. This can severely impact business processes reliant on Airflow.\n")

        print("**4. Other Potential Ingress Misconfigurations:**")
        print("   - **Insecure Headers:** Missing security headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Content-Security-Policy` can leave the application vulnerable to various web-based attacks (e.g., clickjacking, cross-site scripting).")
        print("   - **Open Ports/Services:**  If the Ingress controller itself is not properly secured, it might expose unnecessary ports or services, creating additional attack surfaces.\n")

        print("\n### Attack Scenarios:\n")
        print("* **Credential Theft:** An attacker intercepts login credentials transmitted over an unencrypted connection due to missing TLS.")
        print("* **Session Hijacking:** An attacker intercepts session cookies over an unencrypted connection, allowing them to impersonate a legitimate user.")
        print("* **Denial of Service:** An attacker floods the Ingress with requests, making the Airflow web UI unavailable.")
        print("* **Data Breach:** Sensitive data within the Airflow UI (e.g., connection details, DAG configurations) is intercepted due to lack of encryption or weak ciphers.\n")

        print("\n### Root Cause Analysis:\n")
        print("* **Default Configuration:** The chart might deploy an Ingress with minimal configuration for ease of use, potentially neglecting security best practices.")
        print("* **Lack of User Awareness:** Users deploying the chart might not be aware of the security implications of an improperly configured Ingress.")
        print("* **Complexity of Ingress Configuration:** Securely configuring an Ingress involves understanding TLS certificates, cipher suites, and annotations, which can be complex for some users.")
        print("* **Insufficient Documentation:** The chart's documentation might not adequately emphasize the importance of secure Ingress configuration and provide clear instructions.\n")

        print("\n### Detailed Mitigation Strategies:\n")

        print("**1. Enforce or Strongly Recommend TLS Configuration:**")
        print("   - The chart should, by default, enforce TLS. If not feasible as a hard default, it MUST provide a very strong recommendation and clear, prominent instructions on how to enable it.")
        print("   - Leverage Kubernetes Secrets to manage TLS certificates. The chart should provide guidance on creating and referencing these secrets.")
        print("   - **Cert-Manager Integration:**  The chart should offer seamless integration with cert-manager, allowing for automatic certificate provisioning and renewal. This can be achieved through annotations in the Ingress resource definition.")
        print("   - **Example `values.yaml` configuration:**")
        print("     ```yaml")
        print("     ingress:")
        print("       enabled: true")
        print("       tls:")
        print("         enabled: true")
        print("         secretName: airflow-tls-secret  # User creates this secret")
        print("         # Alternatively, for cert-manager:")
        print("         certManager:")
        print("           issuerRef:")
        print("             name: letsencrypt-prod")
        print("             kind: ClusterIssuer")
        print("     ```\n")

        print("**2. Provide Options to Configure TLS Settings:**")
        print("   - The `values.yaml` should allow users to configure TLS settings, including specifying allowed cipher suites and TLS protocols.")
        print("   - Utilize Ingress controller specific annotations to configure these settings (e.g., `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-ciphers` for Nginx Ingress).")
        print("   - The chart should provide examples of secure cipher suite configurations.")
        print("   - **Example `values.yaml` configuration (for Nginx Ingress):**")
        print("     ```yaml")
        print("     ingress:")
        print("       enabled: true")
        print("       annotations:")
        print("         nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-ciphers: \"TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\"")
        print("         nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-protocols: \"TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3\"")
        print("     ```\n")

        print("**3. Recommend or Provide Options for Rate Limiting:**")
        print("   - The chart's documentation should strongly recommend implementing rate limiting at the Ingress level.")
        print("   - Provide examples and guidance on how to configure rate limiting using Ingress controller specific annotations (e.g., `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps`, `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections`).")
        print("   - Consider providing a basic rate limiting configuration as an optional setting in `values.yaml`.")
        print("   - **Example `values.yaml` configuration (for Nginx Ingress):**")
        print("     ```yaml")
        print("     ingress:")
        print("       enabled: true")
        print("       annotations:")
        print("         nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: \"100\"")
        print("         nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections: \"1000\"")
        print("     ```\n")

        print("**4. Enhance Documentation and Provide Security Best Practices:**")
        print("   - The chart's documentation MUST include a dedicated section on securing the Ingress.")
        print("   - Provide clear instructions and examples for enabling TLS, configuring secure cipher suites, and implementing rate limiting.")
        print("   - Include guidance on setting secure HTTP headers.")
        print("   - Emphasize the importance of keeping the Ingress controller and the chart itself updated.")
        print("   - Recommend using tools like SSL Labs to verify TLS configuration.\n")

        print("**5. Consider Security Context and Network Policies:**")
        print("   - While not directly related to Ingress configuration, recommend setting appropriate security contexts for the Airflow pods and implementing network policies to restrict traffic flow within the cluster.\n")

        print("\n### Recommendations for the Development Team:\n")
        print("* **Security by Default:**  Prioritize secure defaults in the chart's configuration.")
        print("* **User-Friendly Configuration:** Make it easy for users to configure security settings through `values.yaml`.")
        print("* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provide clear, concise, and up-to-date documentation on security best practices.")
        print("* **Examples and Snippets:** Include practical examples of secure Ingress configurations for various Ingress controllers.")
        print("* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security reviews of the chart and its default configurations.")
        print("* **Community Engagement:** Encourage feedback from the community on security aspects of the chart.")
