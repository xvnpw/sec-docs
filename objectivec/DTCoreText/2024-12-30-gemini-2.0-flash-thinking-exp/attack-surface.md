*   **Attack Surface:** HTML Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTML, including JavaScript, into content processed by DTCoreText. When this content is rendered by the application (often in a web view), the injected script executes in the user's browser.
    *   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** DTCoreText parses and renders HTML. While it doesn't directly execute JavaScript, it renders HTML tags and attributes that can trigger JavaScript execution in a web view (e.g., `<img>` with `onerror`, `<a>` with `href="javascript:..."`).
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects the following HTML: `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS!')">`. When DTCoreText renders this, and the application displays it in a web view, the `onerror` event will fire, executing the JavaScript alert.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's session, including stealing cookies, session tokens, and performing actions on behalf of the user. Can lead to data theft, account takeover, and malware distribution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Output Sanitization:**  Sanitize the HTML output *after* DTCoreText processing before displaying it in a web view. Use a robust HTML sanitizer library that is specifically designed to prevent XSS.
            *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the web view can load resources and execute scripts.
            *   **Avoid Rendering Untrusted HTML Directly:** If possible, avoid rendering untrusted HTML directly. Consider using a safer markup language or a more restrictive subset of HTML.

*   **Attack Surface:** CSS Injection leading to UI Redressing/Clickjacking
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious CSS to manipulate the visual presentation of the rendered content, potentially tricking users into clicking on unintended elements or revealing sensitive information.
    *   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** DTCoreText parses and applies CSS styles. Malicious CSS can be used to overlay elements, make elements invisible, or reposition them in a misleading way.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects CSS to make a seemingly harmless button overlay a "Delete Account" button. The user, thinking they are clicking the harmless button, unknowingly triggers the account deletion.
    *   **Impact:**  Unintended actions performed by the user, potentially leading to data loss, unauthorized transactions, or disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **CSS Sanitization (with caution):**  While more complex than HTML sanitization, consider carefully sanitizing CSS to remove potentially dangerous properties (e.g., `position: absolute`, `z-index`). However, be aware that overly aggressive sanitization can break legitimate styling.
            *   **Frame Options/CSP `frame-ancestors`:** If the rendered content is displayed within an iframe, use `X-Frame-Options` or the `frame-ancestors` directive in CSP to prevent the application from being framed by malicious websites.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Styling:**  Limit the scope and power of CSS that can be applied to sensitive parts of the application.

*   **Attack Surface:** Abuse of Custom URL Schemes (if supported and enabled)
    *   **Description:** If DTCoreText supports custom URL schemes, attackers can craft malicious links that, when rendered and interacted with, trigger unintended actions within the application or the underlying operating system.
    *   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** DTCoreText renders links, including those with custom URL schemes. If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize these URLs before processing them, vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a link like `<a href="myapp://deletemyaccount">Click here</a>`. If the application blindly processes the `myapp://deletemyaccount` scheme, it could unintentionally trigger account deletion.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary commands, data modification, or other unintended actions within the application or the operating system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Validation of Custom URL Schemes:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all custom URL schemes before processing them. Implement a whitelist of allowed schemes and parameters.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only allow necessary custom URL schemes and restrict their capabilities.
            *   **User Confirmation:**  Require explicit user confirmation before executing actions triggered by custom URL schemes, especially for sensitive operations.
