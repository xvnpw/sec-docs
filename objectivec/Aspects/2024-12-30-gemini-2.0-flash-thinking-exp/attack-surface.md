* **Malicious Aspect Injection:**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains control over the application's runtime environment and injects malicious aspects to alter the application's behavior.
    * **How Aspects Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Aspects provides the mechanism to dynamically modify method implementations at runtime, making it a powerful tool for injecting malicious code.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to load a malicious library containing aspects that intercept network requests to steal credentials or modify data.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Complete compromise of the application, potential data breach, unauthorized access, and execution of arbitrary code.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust code signing and integrity checks to prevent loading of unauthorized code.
        * Employ runtime application self-protection (RASP) techniques to detect and prevent malicious code injection.
        * Minimize the application's attack surface by restricting access to sensitive APIs and functionalities.

* **Overriding Security-Critical Methods:**
    * **Description:** Developers or attackers use Aspects to override methods responsible for security functionalities, effectively disabling or weakening security measures.
    * **How Aspects Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Aspects allows interception and replacement of any method, including those responsible for authentication, authorization, encryption, and input validation.
    * **Example:** An aspect is used to bypass an authentication check by always returning a successful authentication status, regardless of the provided credentials.
    * **Impact:** High - Significant weakening or complete bypass of security controls, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strictly control the usage of Aspects, especially for security-critical methods.
        * Implement thorough code reviews to identify and prevent the misuse of Aspects for overriding security measures.
        * Consider using more robust and less dynamic security mechanisms where possible.
        * Employ static analysis tools to detect potential overrides of security-sensitive methods.
