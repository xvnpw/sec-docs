Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the FMDB library:

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection through Improperly Sanitized Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into input fields that are directly incorporated into SQL queries executed via FMDB. This is done by crafting input strings that, when processed by the application and passed to FMDB's query execution methods *without using parameter binding*, alter the intended SQL logic. This directly leverages FMDB's ability to execute arbitrary SQL strings.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized data access (reading sensitive information), data modification (updating or deleting records), or even executing arbitrary SQL commands on the database.
    *   **Affected FMDB Component:** `FMDatabase` class, specifically methods like `executeQuery:`, `executeUpdate:`, and their variants **when used with string formatting instead of parameter binding.**
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) with FMDB's `?` placeholders and the `arguments:` or `argumentsArray:` methods.** This is the primary defense against SQL injection when using FMDB.
        *   Implement code review processes to ensure developers are consistently using parameterized queries.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities arising from improper FMDB usage.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the Underlying SQLite Library
    *   **Description:** FMDB is a wrapper around the SQLite library. If vulnerabilities exist in the underlying SQLite library, they could potentially be exploited through FMDB. FMDB's functionality relies directly on SQLite's capabilities and any flaws in SQLite can be exposed through FMDB's interface.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in SQLite, but it could range from data corruption and denial of service to arbitrary code execution in some scenarios. Since FMDB provides the interface to SQLite, vulnerabilities there directly impact applications using FMDB.
    *   **Affected FMDB Component:** Indirectly affects all FMDB components as they rely on SQLite's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the SQLite vulnerability, but can be High or Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Ensure the version of SQLite used by FMDB is up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities.** This often involves updating the FMDB library itself or ensuring the system's SQLite library is current.
        *   Monitor security advisories for SQLite and update FMDB accordingly.
        *   While not a direct mitigation within FMDB, being aware of SQLite vulnerabilities is crucial for developers using FMDB.
