## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using FMDB (High-Risk Sub-Tree)

**Attacker's Goal:** To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the FMDB library or its usage.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via FMDB Exploitation
    * OR: Achieve Unauthorized Data Access
        * AND: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerability [CRITICAL]
            * Leverage Unsanitized User Input in Queries [CRITICAL]
                * ***Inject Malicious SQL to Read Sensitive Data***
    * OR: Achieve Unauthorized Data Modification
        * AND: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerability [CRITICAL]
            * Leverage Unsanitized User Input in Queries [CRITICAL]
                * ***Inject Malicious SQL to Modify Data***
    * OR: Achieve Denial of Service (DoS)
        * AND: Exploit Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Queries
            * Leverage Unsanitized User Input in Queries [CRITICAL]
                * ***Inject Resource-Intensive SQL Queries (e.g., large joins, recursive queries)***
    * OR: Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution (Less Likely, Indirect)
        * AND: Exploit SQL Injection to Modify Application Logic [CRITICAL]
            * Leverage Unsanitized User Input in Queries [CRITICAL]
                * Inject SQL to Modify Data Used for Application Logic (e.g., configuration settings)

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerability**

* This node represents the fundamental vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into queries executed by the application.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, and in some cases, even arbitrary code execution.
* **Relevance:** This is a critical node because it is the gateway to multiple high-risk paths.

**Critical Node: Leverage Unsanitized User Input in Queries**

* This node highlights the dangerous practice of directly incorporating user-provided data into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
* **Impact:** This practice directly enables SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Relevance:** This is a critical node because it is the root cause of the most significant high-risk paths.

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious SQL to Read Sensitive Data**

* **Attack Steps:**
    * The attacker identifies input fields or parameters in the application that are used in database queries.
    * The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize this user input before incorporating it into an SQL query executed by FMDB.
    * The attacker crafts malicious SQL fragments within the user input.
    * When the query is executed, the injected SQL manipulates the query's logic to bypass intended access controls and retrieve sensitive data that the attacker is not authorized to access.
* **Likelihood:** High
* **Impact:** Significant (Exposure of confidential data)
* **Effort:** Low to Moderate
* **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
* **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious SQL to Modify Data**

* **Attack Steps:**
    * The attacker identifies input fields or parameters used in SQL UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE statements.
    * The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize this user input.
    * The attacker injects malicious SQL code designed to alter data within the database.
    * Upon execution, the injected SQL modifies, adds, or deletes data, potentially corrupting data integrity, manipulating application state, or causing financial loss.
* **Likelihood:** High
* **Impact:** Significant to Critical (Data corruption, manipulation of application logic, financial loss)
* **Effort:** Low to Moderate
* **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
* **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate

**High-Risk Path: Inject Resource-Intensive SQL Queries (e.g., large joins, recursive queries)**

* **Attack Steps:**
    * The attacker identifies input fields used in database queries.
    * The application fails to adequately validate or sanitize the input.
    * The attacker crafts SQL queries that are designed to consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O). Examples include queries with large joins, recursive common table expressions (CTEs), or `LIKE` clauses with leading wildcards.
    * When executed, these resource-intensive queries overload the database server, leading to performance degradation or a complete denial of service for the application.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Moderate to Significant (Application slowdown or outage)
* **Effort:** Low to Moderate
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate
* **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult

**High-Risk Path: Inject SQL to Modify Data Used for Application Logic (e.g., configuration settings)**

* **Attack Steps:**
    * The attacker identifies database tables that store configuration settings, application logic, or data used to make decisions within the application.
    * The attacker leverages an SQL injection vulnerability (due to unsanitized user input) to inject SQL code.
    * The injected SQL is designed to modify the data within these critical tables.
    * By altering this data, the attacker can indirectly influence the application's behavior, potentially leading to unintended code execution, privilege escalation, or other forms of compromise.
* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on application design)
* **Impact:** Significant to Critical (Potentially full compromise)
* **Effort:** Moderate to High (Requires understanding application logic)
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
* **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult

This focused view highlights the most critical threats related to FMDB and emphasizes the importance of preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities through robust input sanitization and parameterized queries.
