# Attack Surface Analysis for matthewyork/datetools

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Date/Time String Parsing](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_datetime_string_parsing.md)

**Description:** The application accepts date/time strings from untrusted sources without proper validation, allowing potentially malicious or malformed strings to be processed by `datetools`'s parsing functions. This is the *primary* attack vector directly related to `datetools`.

*   **How `datetools` Contributes:** `datetools`'s parsing functions (`parseDate`, `parseDateTime`, etc.) are the *direct* point of vulnerability. The library's internal parsing logic is what's being exploited.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker submits a date string like `"9999999999999999-99-99"` or a string with an extremely long sequence of repeated characters, aiming for resource exhaustion (DoS).
    *   An attacker provides a date string with an unexpected format, such as `"2024-13-32"` (invalid month and day), hoping to trigger unexpected behavior within `datetools` and, consequently, the application.
    *   An attacker attempts to exploit a known (or unknown) vulnerability in `datetools`'s parsing logic related to specific locales or date/time formats.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Excessive CPU/memory consumption during parsing within `datetools`, making the application unresponsive. This is the *most likely* and *highest impact* scenario.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior:** Incorrect date/time values *returned by datetools* are used in subsequent application logic, leading to errors, data corruption, or potential security bypasses.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is a significant and direct threat; incorrect parsing can have cascading effects on the application).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation *before* passing *any* string to `datetools`. Use a strict whitelist of allowed formats (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`). Reject *all* input that doesn't conform. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable length limits on date/time strings to prevent excessively long inputs from causing resource exhaustion within `datetools`.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Regularly fuzz `datetools`'s parsing functions directly with a wide range of invalid, unexpected, and boundary-case inputs. This is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities within the library itself.
    * **Sanitize Input:** Before passing input to `datetools`, sanitize by removing or escaping potentially harmful characters.
