# Threat Model Analysis for matthewyork/datetools

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Date Input](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_malformed_date_input.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Date Input

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends intentionally malformed or extreme date/time strings (e.g., excessively long years, invalid month/day combinations, non-numeric characters where numbers are expected) to functions within `datetools`. The attacker aims to cause the library to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), crash, or enter an infinite loop, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. This leverages vulnerabilities *within datetools' parsing and processing logic*.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability; potential resource exhaustion on the server; disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Any `datetools` function that parses or processes date/time strings from external input.  This includes, but is not limited to:
        *   `parse_date()` (if it exists - hypothetical example)
        *   `parse_datetime()` (if it exists)
        *   Any function accepting date/time strings as arguments.
        *   Functions that perform calculations based on input dates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Before passing any data to `datetools`, validate the input against a strict whitelist of allowed formats and ranges.  Reject any input that doesn't conform.  Use regular expressions or a dedicated date/time validation library *before* using `datetools`.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement timeouts and resource limits (e.g., maximum memory allocation) on any operation that involves `datetools` processing user-supplied data.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing on all `datetools` functions that accept external input.  This involves feeding the functions with a wide range of valid, invalid, and edge-case inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Ensure that any exceptions or errors thrown by `datetools` are caught and handled gracefully by the application, preventing crashes.

## Threat: [Logic Errors due to Timezone Mishandling](./threats/logic_errors_due_to_timezone_mishandling.md)

*   **Threat:** Logic Errors due to Timezone Mishandling

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits developer misunderstanding of how `datetools` handles timezones (or lack thereof), *specifically within the library's implementation*. The attacker might provide dates in a specific timezone, expecting the application to interpret them incorrectly due to flaws *in how datetools processes or converts timezones*. This could lead to incorrect authorization decisions, data corruption, or other logic errors. For example, if `datetools` has a bug in its timezone conversion logic, an attacker could bypass security checks.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect authorization; data corruption; incorrect calculations; potential security bypasses.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any `datetools` function that deals with timezones, or any function where the developer *assumes* a specific timezone behavior that isn't correctly implemented by the library.  This is highly dependent on how `datetools` is implemented. Examples might include:
        *   Functions for converting between timezones.
        *   Functions for comparing dates and times.
        *   Functions for formatting dates and times.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicit Timezone Handling:** Always explicitly specify the timezone when working with dates and times.  Never rely on implicit timezone conversions or default settings. Use a well-established timezone library (like `pytz` in Python) in conjunction with `datetools` if `datetools` doesn't provide *correct and complete* timezone support.
        *   **Comprehensive Unit Tests:** Write unit tests that specifically cover timezone-related scenarios, including daylight saving time transitions and different timezone offsets. These tests should *validate the correctness of datetools' timezone handling*.
        *   **Documentation Review:** Thoroughly review the `datetools` documentation to understand its timezone handling (or lack thereof). Look for any known issues or limitations.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Ensure that code using `datetools` is reviewed by someone with expertise in date/time handling and timezones.
        * **Validate datetools behavior:** If you suspect that datetools has incorrect timezone handling, create specific test cases to verify its behavior against known-good libraries or standards.
