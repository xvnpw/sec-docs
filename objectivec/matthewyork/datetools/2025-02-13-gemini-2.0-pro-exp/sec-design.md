# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simple, user-friendly command-line tool for date calculations.
*   Offer a lightweight alternative to more complex date manipulation libraries.
*   Ensure accuracy and reliability in date calculations.
*   Support common date-related operations.
*   Maintain a small, easily manageable codebase.

Business Risks:

*   Inaccurate calculations leading to incorrect results and potential user errors.
*   Lack of support for edge cases or specific date formats causing user frustration.
*   Security vulnerabilities, although likely minimal given the tool's scope, could still exist.
*   Poor usability or lack of features compared to alternatives, leading to low adoption.
*   Maintenance overhead if the codebase becomes difficult to manage.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and contributions, which can help identify and address security issues. (GitHub repository)
*   security control: Basic input validation is likely present to handle invalid date formats. (Needs to be verified in the code)
*   security control: The project is written in Python, which has built-in security features and a large community that actively addresses vulnerabilities.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The tool is a command-line utility, and the attack surface is relatively small.
*   accepted risk: The tool primarily performs date calculations, and the risk of sensitive data exposure is low.
*   accepted risk: The project is maintained by a single developer, which may introduce delays in addressing security issues.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement comprehensive input validation to handle various date formats and prevent potential injection vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider using a static analysis tool to automatically detect potential security issues.
*   security control: Add tests to verify that the tool handles edge cases and leap years correctly.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as the tool is a command-line utility without user accounts.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as the tool does not manage access to resources.
*   Input Validation: Crucial to prevent errors and potential vulnerabilities. The tool should handle various date formats and reject invalid inputs.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as the tool does not handle sensitive data requiring encryption. However, if the tool were to interact with external services or store data, cryptography might become relevant.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible deployment solutions:

1.  Manual installation: User downloads the source code and runs it directly using Python.
2.  Package manager: The tool could be packaged and distributed through a package manager like `pip`.
3.  Containerization: The tool could be containerized using Docker for easier distribution and execution.

Chosen solution (Package Manager - `pip`):
