## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit `eval()` in `parse_date()` [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The core vulnerability. The `_parse_rel_date_expr()` function within `parse_date()` uses Python's `eval()` function to evaluate relative date expressions. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Python code.
    *   **Mitigation:** *Immediately* remove or replace the `eval()` call. Rewrite the relative date parsing logic using a safe, non-evaluating method. This is a non-negotiable security requirement.

*   **1.1.1 Inject malicious code into relative date expression [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a string that, when passed to `parse_date()`, will be interpreted as a relative date expression containing malicious Python code.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Same as 1.1 – eliminate the `eval()` call.

    *   **1.1.1.1 Craft input that bypasses basic string checks (if any) [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to circumvent any rudimentary input validation that might be in place (e.g., simple character filtering).
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust, multi-layered input validation *at the application level*. This includes:
            *   Strict whitelisting of allowed characters.
            *   Length restrictions.
            *   Format validation (if possible).
            *   Consider using a dedicated input sanitization library.

    *   **1.1.1.2 Construct payload to execute arbitrary Python code [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker creates the malicious Python code to be executed.  Examples include:
            *   `__import__('os').system('id')`  (Executes the `id` command)
            *   `__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')` (Potentially catastrophic – attempts to delete the root directory)
            *   `__import__('socket').socket(...)` (Opens a network connection for remote control)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Again, eliminating `eval()` is the primary mitigation.  Input validation can also help limit the characters available for payload construction.

    *   **1.1.1.3 Deliver payload via application input field [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker identifies an input field in the application that is processed by `datetools.parse_date()` with relative date parsing enabled.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Ensure *all* user-supplied input, even seemingly harmless date fields, is treated as untrusted.
            *   Apply the robust input validation described above to *all* input fields.

        *   **1.1.1.3.1 Identify vulnerable input field [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker examines the application's functionality to find input fields that might be used for date/time input.
            *   **Mitigation:**  Conduct thorough code reviews and penetration testing to identify all potential entry points for user input.

        *   **1.1.1.3.2 Bypass any application-level input validation [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker tries to find ways to circumvent the application's input validation (e.g., using encoding tricks, exploiting logic flaws).
            *   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust, multi-layered input validation, as described above.  Regularly test the input validation with fuzzing and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__cause_denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Trigger Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the regular expressions used by `datetools` to cause excessive CPU consumption, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Review all regular expressions for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities (nested quantifiers, overlapping alternations).
        *   Simplify regular expressions where possible.
        *   Use a regex engine with built-in ReDoS protection, if available.
        *   Implement input validation to limit the length and complexity of input strings.
        *   Consider replacing `datetools` with a more robust library.

*   **2.1.1 Craft a malicious regular expression that causes catastrophic backtracking [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker designs an input string that triggers exponential backtracking in a vulnerable regular expression.
    *   **Mitigation:** Same as 2.1.

    *   **2.1.1.2 Identify potentially vulnerable regex patterns [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker analyzes the regular expressions in `datetools` to find patterns known to be susceptible to ReDoS.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Use automated tools and manual review to identify vulnerable regex patterns.

    *   **2.1.1.3 Construct an input string that triggers exponential backtracking [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker crafts the specific input string that will cause the ReDoS vulnerability.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Thorough testing and analysis of regular expressions are crucial.

    *   **2.1.1.4 Deliver the malicious input to the application [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Similar to the RCE path, the attacker needs to find a way to submit the malicious input to the application.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Robust input validation, as described previously, is essential.

        *   **2.1.1.4.1 Identify vulnerable input field**
            *   **Description:** Same as 1.1.1.3.1
            *   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1.1.3.1

        *   **2.1.1.4.2 Bypass any application-level input validation**
            *   **Description:** Same as 1.1.1.3.2
            *   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1.1.3.2
