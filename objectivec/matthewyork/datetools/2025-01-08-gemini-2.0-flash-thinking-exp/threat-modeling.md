# Threat Model Analysis for matthewyork/datetools

## Threat: [Malicious Input Exploiting Parsing Logic](./threats/malicious_input_exploiting_parsing_logic.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted date string as input to a `datetools` function (e.g., a function designed to parse a string into a date object). This string is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the library's parsing logic, potentially causing unexpected behavior. The attacker might try to provide extremely long strings, strings with unusual characters, or strings that trigger specific edge cases in the parsing algorithm.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The parsing function might enter an infinite loop or consume excessive resources, leading to application slowdown or unresponsiveness.
*   **Application Error/Crash:** The unexpected input could cause the parsing function to throw an unhandled exception, leading to application errors or crashes.
*   **Incorrect Date/Time Representation:** The flawed parsing logic might result in the library returning an incorrect date or time value, leading to logical errors in the application's subsequent operations.

**Affected `datetools` Component:** Parsing functions (e.g., functions that convert strings to date objects).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided date strings before passing them to `datetools`. This might involve removing or escaping potentially problematic characters.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust validation of date string formats before using `datetools`. Use regular expressions or other validation techniques to ensure the input conforms to expected patterns.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement try-catch blocks around calls to `datetools` parsing functions to gracefully handle potential exceptions thrown due to invalid input.
*   **Consider Alternative Libraries:** If the risk is deemed too high, consider using more robust and well-vetted date/time parsing libraries.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability (If Applicable)](./threats/format_string_vulnerability__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If `datetools` uses format strings for outputting dates and allows user-controlled format strings without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious format specifiers. These specifiers can be used to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially gaining control over the application's execution flow.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could read sensitive information from the application's memory.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In the most severe cases, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Affected `datetools` Component:** Formatting functions (e.g., functions that convert date objects to strings based on a format).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid User-Controlled Format Strings:**  Do not allow users to directly specify the format strings used by `datetools`.
*   **Use Predefined Formatting Options:** Offer a limited set of predefined and safe formatting options to the user.
*   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the `datetools` library's source code to identify if and how format strings are used and ensure proper sanitization.
