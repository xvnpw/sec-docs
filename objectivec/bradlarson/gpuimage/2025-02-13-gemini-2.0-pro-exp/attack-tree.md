## Attack Tree Path: [1. Shader Manipulation (Arbitrary Code Execution) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__shader_manipulation__arbitrary_code_execution___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path focuses on the attacker's ability to inject and execute malicious code within the GPU shaders processed by GPUImage. Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Input Validation Bypass (Shader Source) [CRITICAL] (Medium/Very High)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_input_validation_bypass__shader_source___critical___mediumvery_high_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the crucial first step. The attacker needs to bypass any input validation mechanisms that are supposed to prevent malicious shader code from being processed.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Input validation is often implemented, but frequently contains flaws or oversights.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Successful bypass allows for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of shader syntax and common validation weaknesses.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Craft Malicious Shader Source (Medium/Very High)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_craft_malicious_shader_source__mediumvery_high_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker constructs a shader that contains malicious code, designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the GPU driver, shader compiler, or the application's handling of shader output.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the effectiveness of input validation.
        *   **Impact:** Very High - Arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires knowledge of shader programming and potential exploits.
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Exploit insufficient sanitization of user-provided shader code. [CRITICAL] (Medium/Very High)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_exploit_insufficient_sanitization_of_user-provided_shader_code___critical___mediumvery_high_.md)

*   **Description:** The most common vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided shader code, allowing the attacker to inject malicious instructions. This might involve using an allowlist that is too permissive, failing to handle edge cases, or relying on ineffective blacklisting.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Sanitization is often incomplete or flawed.
            *   **Impact:** Very High - Leads to arbitrary code execution.
            *   **Effort:** Low - Exploiting common sanitization flaws is relatively easy.
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2 Bypass length restrictions on shader source. (Low/Very High)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_bypass_length_restrictions_on_shader_source___lowvery_high_.md)

*   **Description:** The application imposes a length limit on shader code, but the attacker finds a way to bypass this restriction, potentially allowing for more complex and malicious shaders.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low - Length restrictions are usually easier to enforce.
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3 Inject control characters or escape sequences to alter shader parsing. (Low/Very High)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3_inject_control_characters_or_escape_sequences_to_alter_shader_parsing___lowvery_high_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses special characters or escape sequences to manipulate how the shader code is parsed, potentially bypassing validation checks or causing unexpected behavior.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low - Requires a deeper understanding of the shader parser.
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** High
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Shader Parameter Manipulation (Medium/High)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_shader_parameter_manipulation__mediumhigh_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides carefully crafted texture coordinates or other shader parameters that cause the shader to access memory outside of the intended bounds. This can lead to data leaks, crashes, or potentially code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires understanding of how texture coordinates are used and how to trigger out-of-bounds access.
        *   **Impact:** High - Can lead to data leakage or potentially code execution.
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack path focuses on overwhelming the system's resources (CPU, GPU, memory) by exploiting how GPUImage handles resource allocation and processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Excessive Memory Allocation [CRITICAL] (High/Medium)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_excessive_memory_allocation__critical___highmedium_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to consume excessive amounts of memory by creating a large number of GPUImage objects, processing very large images, or chaining together many filters.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - This is a common and relatively easy attack to attempt.
    *   **Impact:** Medium - Causes denial of service, but doesn't necessarily lead to data breaches or code execution.
