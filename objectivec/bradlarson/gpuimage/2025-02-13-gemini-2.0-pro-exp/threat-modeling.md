# Threat Model Analysis for bradlarson/gpuimage

## Threat: [Shader Code Injection/Modification](./threats/shader_code_injectionmodification.md)

*   **Threat:** Shader Code Injection/Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies or injects malicious shader code into GPUImage's processing pipeline.  This could be achieved by tampering with pre-compiled shader files (if the application uses them and doesn't verify integrity), or by exploiting a vulnerability within GPUImage that allows runtime modification of shader code. The attacker's goal is to alter image processing, exfiltrate data by encoding it into the output, or, most critically, execute arbitrary code within the GPU context. This could potentially lead to a full device compromise if the GPU exploit can escalate to kernel-level privileges.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data leakage (sensitive image data, processing parameters).
        *   Arbitrary code execution on the GPU, potentially leading to device compromise.
        *   Application crash or instability.
    *   **GPUImage Component Affected:**
        *   `GPUImageShaderProgram` (This is the core component for managing shaders).
        *   Any filter class that uses custom shaders (e.g., `GPUImageSobelEdgeDetectionFilter`, `GPUImageGaussianBlurFilter`, etc.) *if* their underlying shader code is compromised.
        *   The internal shader loading and compilation mechanisms within GPUImage itself (if a vulnerability exists there).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Signing:** Digitally sign the application and all associated resources, *including* any pre-compiled shader files. This is a crucial defense on platforms that support it (iOS/macOS).
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement runtime checks to verify the integrity of loaded shader code.  This could involve hashing the shader code and comparing it to a known-good hash.  This is challenging due to performance considerations but essential for high-security scenarios.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Shader Generation:**  *Strongly* avoid generating shaders dynamically based on untrusted input.  Use pre-compiled, validated shaders whenever possible. If dynamic generation is absolutely necessary, implement *extremely* rigorous input validation and sanitization.
        *   **Shader Sandboxing (if available):** Explore platform-specific mechanisms for sandboxing shader execution. This is a relatively new area, and availability varies significantly across platforms.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Shaders](./threats/buffer_overflowunderflow_in_shaders.md)

*   **Threat:** Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Shaders

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by a GPUImage shader, triggers a buffer overflow or underflow. This exploits a bug in the shader code (either a custom shader provided by the application or, less likely, a built-in GPUImage shader) where array indexing or texture access goes out of bounds.  The attacker aims to overwrite adjacent memory regions on the GPU, potentially leading to data corruption or, more seriously, control-flow hijacking within the GPU context.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data corruption.
        *   Application crash.
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution on the GPU (although generally more difficult to achieve than with CPU-based buffer overflows).
    *   **GPUImage Component Affected:**
        *   `GPUImageShaderProgram` (if custom shaders are used).
        *   Any filter class that uses a vulnerable shader (built-in or custom).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Shader Auditing:**  *Thoroughly* audit all custom shaders for potential buffer overflows and underflows. Pay extremely close attention to array indexing, texture coordinate calculations, and any loops that access memory.
        *   **Use Safe Shader Languages/APIs:** If possible, use shader languages or APIs that offer some level of bounds checking or memory safety features.  This can help prevent common errors.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Employ fuzz testing techniques to test shaders with a wide range of inputs, specifically designed to trigger edge cases and potential out-of-bounds access. This is a crucial testing strategy.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Indirectly):** While the vulnerability is in the *shader*, sanitizing the input *to the application* can help prevent the application from passing data that is likely to trigger the vulnerability. This is a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Shaders or Library Code](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_shaders_or_library_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow/Underflow in Shaders or Library Code

    *   **Description:** Similar to buffer overflows, but this threat focuses on vulnerabilities arising from integer arithmetic errors within GPUImage's shaders or its underlying C/C++/Objective-C code. An attacker crafts input that causes an integer overflow or underflow, leading to unexpected behavior. This could result in incorrect calculations, out-of-bounds memory access (indirectly, by corrupting indices), or potentially even control-flow hijacking, although this is more challenging on the GPU.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data corruption.
        *   Application crash.
        *   Potential for control-flow hijacking (more difficult on GPUs compared to CPUs).
    *   **GPUImage Component Affected:**
        *   `GPUImageShaderProgram` (if custom shaders are used, as shader code is the most likely place for these errors).
        *   Any filter class with a vulnerable shader or vulnerable C/C++/Objective-C code within the filter's implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Shader and Code Auditing:** Thoroughly audit all custom shaders *and* the C/C++/Objective-C code of GPUImage filters for potential integer overflows and underflows.
        *   **Use Safe Integer Types:** Use integer types that are large enough to prevent overflows for the expected range of values. Consider using wider types (e.g., `int64_t` instead of `int32_t`) if necessary.
        *   **Overflow/Underflow Checks:** Add explicit checks for integer overflows and underflows *before* performing arithmetic operations, especially in loops or when dealing with user-provided values. This is crucial for security.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing to generate a wide variety of integer inputs, specifically targeting edge cases and potential overflow/underflow scenarios.
