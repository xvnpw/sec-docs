# Attack Surface Analysis for bradlarson/gpuimage

## Attack Surface: [Shader Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/shader_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into the OpenGL ES shaders executed on the GPU.
*   **How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage's core functionality is the execution of shaders.  If the application allows any user-influenced input to affect the shader code (directly or indirectly), this vulnerability exists.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to enter a "color formula" that is directly used to construct a fragment shader.  An attacker provides a formula containing malicious shader code to read from arbitrary GPU memory.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure (reading GPU memory, potentially from other processes)
    *   Denial of Service (GPU resource exhaustion)
    *   Potential (though unlikely without driver/hardware bugs) arbitrary code execution on the GPU.
    *   Data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  *Never* allow user input to directly construct shader code.  This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Parameterized Shaders:** Use a predefined set of safe, parameterized shaders.  Users can only select from these and adjust allowed parameters within safe ranges.
    *   **Templating Engine (with Extreme Caution and Review):** If dynamic shader generation is *absolutely* necessary, use a *secure* templating engine with strict escaping, input validation, and a whitelist of allowed operations and functions.  Thorough security review of the templating logic is mandatory.
    *   **Shader Validation (Pre-Compilation):** Use a shader validator (if available) to check the syntax of generated shaders *before* attempting to compile them.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce limits on GPU resource usage (execution time, memory allocation) to mitigate DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [GPU Memory Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/gpu_memory_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide input designed to consume excessive GPU memory, leading to denial of service.
*   **How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage operates on image data and creates textures/buffers on the GPU.  The library's API allows for the creation of potentially very large textures.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a series of extremely high-resolution images, or triggers a filter chain that generates a large number of intermediate textures, exceeding the available GPU memory.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application, other GPU-dependent applications, or the entire system).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Size Limits:** Enforce maximum dimensions and file sizes for all input images.  This is crucial.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Actively monitor GPU memory usage.  Implement safeguards (e.g., abort processing, clear caches, reject new requests) if limits are approached.
    *   **Progressive Processing:** For very large images, process them in smaller tiles or chunks to reduce peak memory usage.
    *   **Memory Pooling/Caching:** Reuse GPU memory resources (textures, buffers) where possible to minimize allocation overhead and reduce the likelihood of exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [GPU Processing Time Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/gpu_processing_time_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide input that causes excessively long GPU processing times, leading to denial of service.
*   **How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage's shader execution is the core processing bottleneck.  Complex shaders or large images can take a significant amount of time to process.
*   **Example:** An attacker selects a computationally intensive filter and applies it to a large image, or provides a crafted shader with an intentionally inefficient algorithm (if shader injection is possible).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application becomes unresponsive).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts for all GPU processing operations.  Terminate shaders that exceed the allowed execution time.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Perform GPU operations in a background thread (or using asynchronous APIs) to avoid blocking the main application thread.
    *   **Shader Complexity Limits:** If users can select shaders, limit the complexity of the available shaders (e.g., maximum number of operations, texture lookups, loop iterations).
    *   **Input Size Limits:** (As with memory exhaustion) - smaller inputs generally lead to shorter processing times.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Driver/Hardware Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_driverhardware_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Attackers leverage bugs in the underlying OpenGL ES driver or GPU hardware via crafted shaders or input.
* **How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage *directly* interacts with the driver and hardware through OpenGL ES calls. Malicious shaders are the primary vector.
* **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific GPU driver allows a shader to escape sandboxing. An attacker, through shader injection, exploits this.
* **Impact:** Varies greatly, up to and including arbitrary code execution (system compromise).
* **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Drivers Updated:** Encourage users to update drivers (out of developer control, but important).
    *   **Fuzzing (Advanced):** Fuzzing GPUImage and the driver with various shader inputs.
    * **Use Sandboxing Technologies:** Use all available sandboxing technologies.
    * **Prevent Shader Code Injection:** Preventing shader code injection mitigates a large portion of driver-level attacks.
