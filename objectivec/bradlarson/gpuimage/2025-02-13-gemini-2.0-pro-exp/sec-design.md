# Project Design Document: GPUImage

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a high-performance, cross-platform image and video processing framework.
*   Enable developers to easily leverage GPU acceleration for image and video manipulation.
*   Offer a flexible and extensible architecture for creating custom image processing operations.
*   Maintain a user-friendly API that simplifies complex GPU-based computations.
*   Support a wide range of image and video formats.
*   Foster an active open-source community for contributions and support.

Business Risks:

*   Performance bottlenecks: Inefficient GPU utilization or memory management could lead to performance issues, hindering the core value proposition of the framework.
*   Platform compatibility issues: Inconsistencies across different operating systems, GPU vendors, or driver versions could limit the framework's reach and usability.
*   Security vulnerabilities: Bugs in the framework, especially in custom filter implementations, could expose applications to security risks like buffer overflows or code injection.
*   Maintainability challenges: As the framework grows, maintaining code quality, API consistency, and backward compatibility could become increasingly difficult.
*   Community engagement: Lack of active community participation could slow down development, bug fixing, and feature additions.
*   Competition: Other GPU-accelerated image processing libraries could emerge, potentially offering better performance, features, or ease of use.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: The project is open-source, allowing for community code review and scrutiny. (Described in GitHub repository's contribution guidelines and pull request process).
*   security control: Limited external dependencies: Reducing the number of external dependencies minimizes the attack surface. (Visible in the project's source code and build configuration).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on underlying platform security: The framework's security depends on the security of the underlying operating system, GPU drivers, and hardware.
*   accepted risk: Potential for user-introduced vulnerabilities: Custom filters created by users may contain security flaws, as the framework cannot guarantee the security of user-provided code.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Static analysis: Integrate static analysis tools into the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the framework's code.
*   security control: Fuzz testing: Implement fuzz testing to discover edge cases and vulnerabilities that might be missed by manual code review or static analysis.
*   security control: Input validation: Implement robust input validation for all user-provided data, including image data, filter parameters, and custom shader code.
*   security control: Sandboxing (if applicable): If the framework supports running user-provided code (e.g., custom shaders), consider implementing sandboxing mechanisms to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Regular dependency updates: Keep all dependencies up-to-date to address known security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Security documentation: Provide clear documentation on secure coding practices for users developing custom filters.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as the framework itself does not handle user authentication.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable, as the framework does not manage user permissions or access control.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input data, including image dimensions, pixel formats, filter parameters, and custom shader code, must be validated to prevent buffer overflows, code injection, and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Specific validation rules should be defined based on the expected data types and ranges.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If the framework handles sensitive data (which is unlikely in this case), appropriate cryptographic algorithms and key management practices should be used.
    *   The framework itself does not appear to require cryptographic functionality.
*   Output Encoding:
    *   If the framework is used to generate output that will be displayed in a web browser or other context where cross-site scripting (XSS) is a concern, appropriate output encoding should be applied.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   **Image/Video Processing:** The core functionality of the framework, enabling users to manipulate images and videos.
*   **Custom Filter Creation:** Allowing developers to extend the framework with their own image processing operations.
*   **Application Development:** Enabling developers to build applications that leverage GPU-accelerated image/video processing.

Data Sensitivity:

*   **Image/Video Data:** The primary data processed by the framework. Sensitivity depends on the content of the images/videos.  Could range from non-sensitive (e.g., public domain images) to highly sensitive (e.g., personal photos, medical images, confidential documents).
*   **Filter Parameters:** Data used to configure image processing filters. Generally not sensitive, but could potentially leak information about the processing being performed.
*   **Custom Shader Code:** Code written by users to define custom image processing operations.  Could potentially contain sensitive algorithms or intellectual property.
