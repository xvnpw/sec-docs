## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using GPUImage [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_gpuimage__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shader Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shader_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category represents a significant weakness where attackers can manipulate or inject malicious code into the GPU processing pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Shader Injection [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/shader_injection__critical_node___high_risk_path_start_.md)

Attackers exploit insufficient input sanitization when constructing GLSL shader code dynamically. By injecting malicious code, they can gain control over GPU execution or access sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious GLSL Code](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_glsl_code.md)

The attacker crafts and injects malicious GLSL code into the application's shader pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Arbitrary Code Execution on GPU [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_arbitrary_code_execution_on_gpu__critical_node___high_risk_path_end_.md)

Successful shader injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the GPU. While direct OS-level code execution might be limited, this can lead to manipulation of application data, influence application behavior, or potentially exploit driver vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak Sensitive Data from GPU Memory [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/leak_sensitive_data_from_gpu_memory__critical_node___high_risk_path_end_.md)

Maliciously injected shaders can be designed to read and exfiltrate data from GPU memory that the attacker should not have access to. This could include processed image data, intermediate calculations, or other sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL_NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on weaknesses in how the application handles and transfers image and video data, particularly when interacting with the GPU.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Data Transfer to GPU [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_data_transfer_to_gpu__critical_node___high_risk_path_start_.md)

The application fails to properly validate the size of incoming image or video data before transferring it to the GPU.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Oversized Image/Video Data](./attack_tree_paths/send_oversized_imagevideo_data.md)

The attacker sends image or video data that exceeds the expected buffer size.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Adjacent Memory Regions](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_adjacent_memory_regions.md)

The oversized data overwrites memory locations adjacent to the intended buffer, potentially corrupting data or control flow information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Code Execution [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_execution__critical_node___high_risk_path_end_.md)

By carefully crafting the overflowed data, the attacker can overwrite critical memory regions, such as return addresses or function pointers, to redirect program execution and gain control of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Filters/Extensions [CRITICAL_NODE] [HIGH_RISK_PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_filtersextensions__critical_node___high_risk_path_start_.md)

Developers often create custom filters or extensions for GPUImage. Security flaws in this custom code can be a significant attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Security Flaws in Developer-Created Code Using GPUImage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_security_flaws_in_developer-created_code_using_gpuimage.md)

This is a broad category encompassing various vulnerabilities that can be introduced through insecure coding practices in custom GPUImage components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Code Execution, Information Disclosure, DoS, etc. [HIGH_RISK_PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_execution__information_disclosure__dos__etc___high_risk_path_end_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom filters can lead to a range of severe consequences, including the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, leak sensitive information processed by the custom filter, or cause denial of service by crashing the application or overloading resources. This can involve applying techniques from other branches of the attack tree to the custom code.
