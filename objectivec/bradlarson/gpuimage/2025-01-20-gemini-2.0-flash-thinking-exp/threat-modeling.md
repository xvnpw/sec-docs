# Threat Model Analysis for bradlarson/gpuimage

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Native Code](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_native_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input that causes `gpuimage`'s native code (likely C/C++) to write beyond the allocated buffer. This could overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten data.

**Impact:** Potentially allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. This could result in data theft, malware installation, or remote control.

**Affected Component:** Native code components of `gpuimage`, particularly memory allocation and manipulation functions within image processing filters.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest version of `gpuimage` as security vulnerabilities are discovered and patched.
* If modifying or extending `gpuimage`'s native code, perform rigorous memory safety checks and use secure coding practices to prevent buffer overflows.
* Consider using memory safety tools during development and testing of the application and `gpuimage` integration.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Vulnerability](./threats/use-after-free_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers a scenario where `gpuimage` attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to crashes or, more seriously, allow the attacker to potentially control the contents of the freed memory and gain control of the application.

**Impact:** Can lead to application crashes or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Memory management routines within `gpuimage`'s native code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest version of `gpuimage`.
* If contributing to or modifying `gpuimage`, employ careful memory management practices and utilize memory debugging tools to detect and prevent use-after-free errors.
