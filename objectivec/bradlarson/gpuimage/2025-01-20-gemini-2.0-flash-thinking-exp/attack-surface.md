# Attack Surface Analysis for bradlarson/gpuimage

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image/Video Input](./attack_surfaces/malicious_imagevideo_input.md)

**Description:** The application processes image or video data provided by users or external sources. Maliciously crafted files can exploit vulnerabilities in the decoding or processing logic.

**How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage is responsible for decoding and processing this input data to apply filters and effects. Vulnerabilities in its underlying decoding mechanisms or processing pipeline can be triggered by malformed input.

**Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted PNG file with unusual header information that causes a buffer overflow when GPUImage attempts to decode it.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize the latest version of GPUImage, which may contain fixes for known vulnerabilities.
* Implement error handling and boundary checks within the application when using GPUImage to process input.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Management Issues within GPUImage](./attack_surfaces/memory_management_issues_within_gpuimage.md)

**Description:** Bugs within GPUImage's internal memory management can lead to memory leaks or buffer overflows/underflows.

**How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage allocates and manages memory for textures, framebuffers, and intermediate processing results. Errors in this management can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Applying a specific sequence of filters in GPUImage causes a memory leak, eventually leading to the application consuming excessive memory and crashing.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service due to resource exhaustion, potential for arbitrary code execution in case of buffer overflows/underflows.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update GPUImage to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to memory management.
* Implement robust memory management practices in the application code, even when using GPUImage.
* Utilize memory profiling tools to identify potential memory leaks during development and testing.

## Attack Surface: [Shader Vulnerabilities (if custom shaders are allowed)](./attack_surfaces/shader_vulnerabilities__if_custom_shaders_are_allowed_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to provide custom shaders that are then executed by GPUImage, malicious shaders could contain vulnerabilities.

**How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage provides the mechanism to load and execute custom shaders. If these shaders are not properly vetted, they can introduce security risks.

**Example:** A user provides a custom shader that contains code to read from arbitrary memory locations on the GPU or cause a denial of service by entering an infinite loop.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential information disclosure from GPU memory.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid allowing users to provide arbitrary custom shaders if possible.
* If custom shaders are necessary, implement a strict review and sanitization process for all submitted shaders.
* Run custom shaders in a sandboxed environment with limited access to system resources.
* Implement safeguards to prevent infinite loops or excessive resource consumption within custom shaders.
