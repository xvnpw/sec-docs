# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, GPUImage, is an open-source iOS library for GPU-based image and video processing. The primary business goal is to provide iOS developers with a high-performance and easy-to-use solution for applying image and video effects within their applications. This addresses the need for efficient media processing on mobile devices, enhancing user experience in applications that require real-time or fast image and video manipulation.

Business priorities are:
- Performance: The library must be highly performant, leveraging the GPU for efficient processing to ensure smooth user experiences in mobile applications.
- Ease of Integration: The library should be simple to integrate into existing and new iOS projects, with clear documentation and a straightforward API.
- Feature Richness: Offer a wide range of image and video processing filters and effects to cater to diverse application needs.
- Stability and Reliability: The library needs to be stable and reliable to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior in applications using it.
- Community Support: As an open-source project, community support and contributions are important for long-term maintenance and growth.

Most important business risks to address:
- Performance Bottlenecks: Inefficient code or algorithms could lead to performance issues, negating the primary benefit of GPU acceleration.
- Integration Complexity: Difficult integration or unclear documentation could deter developers from adopting the library.
- Feature Gaps: Lack of essential features or filters could limit the library's applicability and adoption.
- Instability and Bugs: Bugs or instability could lead to application crashes and negative user reviews for applications using the library.
- Lack of Community Support: Insufficient community support could result in slow bug fixes, feature development, and eventual project stagnation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open Source Code Review - The code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny.
- security control: BSD License - Permissive license encourages broad usage and potential community contributions, which can indirectly lead to bug fixes and security improvements.
- security control: Dependency Management - Project likely uses dependency management tools (like CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager) which may offer some level of dependency vulnerability scanning (depending on the tools and configurations used by developers integrating the library).
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security - Security updates and vulnerability patches are dependent on community contributions and maintainer responsiveness, which can vary.
- accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies - The library may depend on third-party libraries, which could introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed and vetted.
- accepted risk: Client-Side Execution - As a client-side library, security relies heavily on the security posture of the integrating application and the iOS platform itself.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning in the development and release pipeline to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically analyze the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits, especially before major releases, to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.
- security control: Input Validation and Sanitization - Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the library to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities due to malformed input data (images, videos, filter parameters).

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a client-side library. Authentication is the responsibility of the application integrating the library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a client-side library. Authorization is the responsibility of the application integrating the library.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library must validate all input data, including image and video data, filter parameters, and any other user-provided input, to prevent unexpected behavior, crashes, or potential vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed at the library's API boundaries to ensure that only valid and expected data is processed.
    - Requirement: Error handling for invalid input should be robust and should not expose sensitive information or lead to exploitable conditions.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If the library handles sensitive image or video data that requires confidentiality or integrity, appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered. However, based on the project description, cryptography is not a primary requirement. If used, ensure proper implementation of cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.
    - Requirement: If the library interacts with external services or storage that requires secure communication, ensure that communication channels are encrypted using protocols like HTTPS.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Efficient and reliable image and video processing within iOS applications. This directly impacts the user experience of applications using the GPUImage library.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Image and video data processed by applications using the GPUImage library.
- Sensitivity of data depends on the application context. It could range from publicly available images to highly sensitive personal or medical images and videos.
- The library itself does not store data, but processes data provided by the integrating application. The risk is primarily related to vulnerabilities in the library that could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure of the data being processed by applications using it.
- Code integrity of the GPUImage library itself is also important to protect, as compromised library code could be distributed to many applications, potentially causing widespread impact.
