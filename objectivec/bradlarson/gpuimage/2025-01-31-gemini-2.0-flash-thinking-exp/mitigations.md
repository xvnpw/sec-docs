# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bradlarson/gpuimage

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate User-Provided Filter Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/validate_user-provided_filter_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all points in your application where user input can influence `GPUImage` filter selection or parameter values. This includes UI elements or API endpoints that configure `GPUImage` filters.
    *   Step 2: Define strict validation rules for each input point, specifying data type, range, and format for filter parameters relevant to `GPUImage` filters.
    *   Step 3: Implement input validation logic *before* passing user input to `GPUImage` functions. Use programming language features for validation and error handling.
    *   Step 4: Reject invalid input and provide informative error messages. Do not process images with invalid `GPUImage` parameters.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Filter Parameter Injection** (Severity: Medium to High): Malicious users could inject harmful values into `GPUImage` filter parameters, causing crashes, unexpected behavior, or exploiting vulnerabilities in `GPUImage` or graphics drivers.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion** (Severity: Medium): Extreme parameter values could lead to computationally expensive `GPUImage` filter operations, causing performance degradation or application freeze.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Filter Parameter Injection:** High reduction in risk. Proper validation prevents injection attacks by ensuring only valid `GPUImage` parameters are processed.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction in risk. Validation limits extreme values, reducing resource exhaustion through parameter manipulation in `GPUImage` filters.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Partially* - Input validation might exist in general application forms, but specific validation for `GPUImage` filter parameters is likely not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Specific validation logic for `GPUImage` filter parameters is likely missing wherever user input configures `GPUImage` filters in the application's code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Allowed Filter Selection](./mitigation_strategies/limit_allowed_filter_selection.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all `GPUImage` filters used in your application.
    *   Step 2: Create a whitelist of `GPUImage` filters necessary for your application's functionality and reviewed for security.
    *   Step 3: Restrict user filter selection to this whitelist. Prevent arbitrary filter specification or custom filter uploads to `GPUImage`.
    *   Step 4: If filter selection is exposed, populate UI elements or API options only with filters from the `GPUImage` whitelist.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Filter Exploitation** (Severity: High): If `GPUImage` or specific filters have vulnerabilities, arbitrary filter selection increases the attack surface. Malicious users could trigger vulnerabilities by selecting specific `GPUImage` filters.
    *   **Shader Injection (Indirect)** (Severity: Medium): Allowing a wide range of `GPUImage` filters increases the chance of encountering and exploiting a filter with a shader vulnerability within `GPUImage`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Filter Exploitation:** High reduction in risk. Whitelisting reduces the attack surface by limiting filters to a vetted set within `GPUImage`.
    *   **Shader Injection (Indirect):** Medium reduction in risk. Reduces the chance of vulnerable shaders by limiting the `GPUImage` filter pool.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Potentially Partially* - The application might use a limited set of `GPUImage` filters functionally, but a security-driven whitelist might be absent.

*   **Missing Implementation:** A formal, security-driven whitelist of allowed `GPUImage` filters is likely missing. Explicit checks to prevent using `GPUImage` filters outside the safe set are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Static Shader Analysis and Review](./mitigation_strategies/static_shader_analysis_and_review.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Gather all shader code used by your application, including shaders provided by `GPUImage` and any custom shaders used with `GPUImage`.
    *   Step 2: Perform manual code review of each shader, focusing on security vulnerabilities relevant to shader code in the context of `GPUImage` usage (buffer overflows, integer issues, etc.).
    *   Step 3: Use static analysis tools for shader languages (GLSL, etc.) if available to automatically scan `GPUImage` shaders for vulnerabilities.
    *   Step 4: Document findings and address vulnerabilities by modifying shader code or implementing mitigations in application logic interacting with `GPUImage`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Shader Vulnerabilities Exploitation** (Severity: High): Vulnerabilities in `GPUImage` shader code can cause crashes, memory corruption, or potentially code execution if exploited through `GPUImage`.
    *   **Information Leakage via Shaders** (Severity: Medium): `GPUImage` shaders might unintentionally leak information through output textures if not carefully designed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Shader Vulnerabilities Exploitation:** High reduction in risk. Shader analysis and remediation reduce the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities within `GPUImage` shaders.
    *   **Information Leakage via Shaders:** Medium reduction in risk. Shader review helps prevent unintended information leakage from `GPUImage` shaders.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Likely No* - Static shader analysis and security reviews of `GPUImage` shaders are not common practice.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Static shader analysis and security review of `GPUImage` shaders are likely completely missing. This should be implemented when using `GPUImage`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Dynamic Shader Generation](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_dynamic_shader_generation.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review application code to identify instances where shader code used with `GPUImage` is dynamically generated based on user input or external data.
    *   Step 2: Refactor to eliminate or minimize dynamic shader generation for `GPUImage`.
    *   Step 3: Prefer using pre-compiled and tested shaders statically included when working with `GPUImage`.
    *   Step 4: If dynamic shader generation for `GPUImage` is unavoidable, implement extremely robust input sanitization and validation for all data used in shader construction.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Shader Injection (Direct)** (Severity: High): Dynamically generating shaders for `GPUImage` based on user input creates a direct pathway for shader injection attacks within the `GPUImage` pipeline.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Shader Injection (Direct):** High reduction in risk. Eliminating dynamic shader generation removes the primary attack vector for direct shader injection in the context of `GPUImage`.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Potentially Partially* -  The application might not intentionally generate shaders from user input for `GPUImage`, but indirect dynamic construction might occur through filter parameters.

*   **Missing Implementation:** A conscious effort to eliminate dynamic shader generation for `GPUImage` and a codebase review to ensure no unintended dynamic shader construction is occurring is likely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Image Processing Complexity](./mitigation_strategies/control_image_processing_complexity.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement limits on the maximum resolution of images processed by `GPUImage`.
    *   Step 2: Limit the maximum number of filters applied in a `GPUImage` processing pipeline.
    *   Step 3: Estimate computational cost of `GPUImage` filter combinations and reject requests exceeding a complexity threshold.
    *   Step 4: Implement timeouts for `GPUImage` image processing operations to prevent resource monopolization.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion** (Severity: Medium to High): Processing large images or applying many complex `GPUImage` filters can exhaust GPU resources, leading to DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** Medium to High reduction in risk. Limiting image size and `GPUImage` filter complexity reduces potential for resource exhaustion DoS attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Potentially Partially* - Implicit limits might exist due to UI or performance, but explicit, security-driven limits on `GPUImage` processing complexity are likely missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit controls and limits on image resolution, `GPUImage` filter count, and processing complexity, designed to prevent resource exhaustion DoS related to `GPUImage`, are likely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor GPU Resource Usage](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_gpu_resource_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement monitoring of GPU resource usage (memory, processing time, utilization) within your application, specifically during `GPUImage` operations.
    *   Step 2: Set up alerts or logging to detect unusual spikes in GPU resource consumption related to `GPUImage`.
    *   Step 3: If resource usage exceeds thresholds during `GPUImage` operations, implement mechanisms to terminate tasks, throttle requests, or alert administrators.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Detection and Mitigation** (Severity: Medium): Monitoring helps detect DoS attacks that attempt to exhaust GPU resources via `GPUImage`, allowing for mitigation.
    *   **Detection of Anomalous Shader Behavior** (Severity: Low to Medium): Unusual GPU resource usage patterns during `GPUImage` operations might indicate unexpected shader behavior or exploitation attempts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Detection and Mitigation:** Medium reduction in risk. Monitoring provides visibility into resource usage during `GPUImage` operations and enables reactive mitigation.
    *   **Detection of Anomalous Shader Behavior:** Low to Medium reduction in risk. Monitoring can provide early warning signs of issues related to `GPUImage` shaders.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Likely No* - GPU resource monitoring within application code, specifically for `GPUImage` operations, is not typical.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Application-level GPU resource monitoring and automated response mechanisms specifically for `GPUImage` usage are likely missing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known GPUImage Vulnerabilities:** High reduction in risk. Regularly updating `GPUImage` patches known vulnerabilities, reducing exploitation risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *Potentially Partially* - General dependency updates might occur, but security-focused updates for `GPUImage` might not be prioritized.

*   **Missing Implementation:** A dedicated process for tracking `GPUImage` security updates and proactively applying them is likely missing.
