*   **Attack Vector:** Specifically crafting malicious image or video files designed to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities in GPUImage's image/video processing routines.
    *   **Crafting Techniques:** Manipulating file headers, color palettes, image dimensions, or video codecs to trigger buffer overflows during decoding or processing.
    *   **Delivery Methods:** User uploads, embedding in web pages, malicious links, or any method where the application processes external image/video data.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Robust input validation, secure decoding libraries, content security policies, and sandboxing of image/video processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirectly via GPUImage)](./attack_tree_paths/6___critical_node__1_3__dependency_vulnerabilities__indirectly_via_gpuimage_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries that GPUImage depends on, such as graphics libraries (OpenGL ES, Metal) or image/video decoding libraries.
    *   **Indirect Exploitation:** Attackers don't directly target GPUImage code, but rather vulnerabilities in its dependencies, which can still compromise applications using GPUImage.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, system compromise, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability in the dependency.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Regularly update system libraries and GPU drivers, monitor security advisories for dependencies, and consider using containerization or sandboxing to isolate the application and its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. [CRITICAL NODE] 1.3.1. Vulnerabilities in Underlying Graphics Libraries (OpenGL ES, Metal, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/7___critical_node__1_3_1__vulnerabilities_in_underlying_graphics_libraries__opengl_es__metal__etc__.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the graphics libraries (OpenGL ES, Metal, Vulkan, etc.) used by GPUImage to interact with the GPU.
    *   **Graphics Library as Attack Surface:** Graphics libraries are complex and interact directly with hardware, making them potential targets for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution at a lower level, potentially GPU takeover, system instability, denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep system libraries and GPU drivers updated, monitor security advisories for graphics libraries, and consider platform-specific security hardening.

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in image and video decoding libraries used by the operating system or directly by GPUImage to handle different media formats (PNG, JPEG, MP4, etc.).
    *   **Decoding Libraries as Attack Vector:** Decoding libraries are complex and handle untrusted data, making them prone to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and format string bugs.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, information leakage.
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure the operating system and relevant decoding libraries are updated, use secure and well-maintained decoding libraries, implement file format validation, and consider sandboxing decoding processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. 2. Exploit Misuse or Misconfiguration of GPUImage in Application](./attack_tree_paths/9__2__exploit_misuse_or_misconfiguration_of_gpuimage_in_application.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how developers use or configure GPUImage within their application, rather than flaws in GPUImage itself.
    *   **Developer Responsibility:**  Even a secure library can be misused to create vulnerabilities in an application.
    *   **Impact:** Range from information disclosure and denial of service to potentially triggering underlying GPUImage vulnerabilities due to improper usage.
