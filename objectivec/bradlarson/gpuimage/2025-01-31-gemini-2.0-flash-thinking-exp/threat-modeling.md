# Threat Model Analysis for bradlarson/gpuimage

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Image/Video Input](./threats/maliciously_crafted_imagevideo_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image or video file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in GPUImage's image decoding or processing logic. Exploitation could involve buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other vulnerabilities in image processing libraries used by GPUImage.
**Impact:** Application crash, unexpected behavior, potential remote code execution if vulnerabilities are severe enough. Data corruption if processing logic is compromised.
**Affected GPUImage Component:** Image Input Handling, potentially underlying image decoding libraries used by GPUImage.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to GPUImage.
* Use well-vetted and regularly updated image decoding libraries.
* Limit supported image formats to only those necessary and well-tested.
* Regularly update GPUImage and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Consider using sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [GPU Resource Exhaustion](./threats/gpu_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends numerous or resource-intensive requests that cause GPUImage to consume excessive GPU resources (memory, processing time). This could be achieved by repeatedly applying complex filter chains, processing high-resolution images/videos, or sending a flood of requests. This can lead to performance degradation for other application components or even system-wide instability, effectively causing a Denial of Service.
**Impact:** Denial of Service, application slowdown, system instability, reduced availability.
**Affected GPUImage Component:** Resource Management, Processing Pipeline, potentially all GPUImage modules involved in processing.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting and resource quotas for GPUImage operations.
* Monitor GPU resource usage and set thresholds to prevent exhaustion.
* Optimize filter chains and processing pipelines to minimize resource consumption.
* Implement timeouts for GPUImage processing operations.
* Use caching mechanisms to reduce redundant GPU processing.

## Threat: [Memory Leaks in GPU Memory](./threats/memory_leaks_in_gpu_memory.md)

**Description:** Bugs within GPUImage or its underlying OpenGL ES implementation could lead to memory leaks in GPU memory. Over time, repeated operations or specific filter combinations could cause GPU memory to be allocated but not released. An attacker might trigger these leaks by repeatedly using certain features or filters, eventually exhausting GPU memory and causing crashes or performance degradation.
**Impact:** Application crash, performance degradation over time, Denial of Service due to memory exhaustion.
**Affected GPUImage Component:** Memory Management, potentially core GPUImage modules or underlying OpenGL ES integration.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update GPUImage and the underlying graphics drivers.
* Perform thorough testing and profiling of your application's GPU memory usage when using GPUImage, especially during long-running sessions or under heavy load.
* Monitor GPU memory usage in production environments.
* Report suspected memory leaks to the GPUImage maintainers.
