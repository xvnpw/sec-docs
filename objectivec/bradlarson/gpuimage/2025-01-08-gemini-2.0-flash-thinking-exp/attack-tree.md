## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in GPUImage Library (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gpuimage_library__critical_node_.md)

This represents a direct attempt to leverage inherent flaws or weaknesses within the GPUImage library's code. Success here can lead to a wide range of compromises depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise a Dependency of GPUImage (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_a_dependency_of_gpuimage__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target libraries that GPUImage relies on. By compromising a dependency, they can inject malicious code or exploit vulnerabilities within that dependency, indirectly affecting the application using GPUImage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit a Known Vulnerability in a Dependency (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_a_known_vulnerability_in_a_dependency__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves leveraging publicly known security flaws in one of GPUImage's dependencies. Attackers can use readily available exploits if the application doesn't keep its dependencies updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Manipulation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/input_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

This focuses on providing specially crafted or malicious input to GPUImage to trigger unintended behavior or vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malformed Image Input (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/malformed_image_input__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers provide image files with unexpected or invalid data structures. This can exploit weaknesses in image decoding libraries or processing logic within GPUImage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in Image Decoding (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_image_decoding__high-risk_path_.md)

A malformed image can cause the image decoding process to write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Excessive Resource Consumption (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_excessive_resource_consumption__high-risk_path_.md)

A specially crafted image can force GPUImage to allocate excessive memory or processing power, leading to a Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion within GPUImage (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_within_gpuimage__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers aim to overwhelm the GPU or system resources by triggering computationally expensive operations within GPUImage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Computationally Expensive Filters Repeatedly (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_computationally_expensive_filters_repeatedly__high-risk_path_.md)

By repeatedly applying resource-intensive filters, attackers can exhaust GPU processing power, leading to a Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Excessive Memory Allocation on GPU (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_excessive_memory_allocation_on_gpu__high-risk_path_.md)

Providing input that forces GPUImage to allocate large textures or buffers can lead to application crashes or system instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via Unsafe Integration (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_unsafe_integration__critical_node_.md)

If the application's integration with GPUImage allows for callbacks or execution of external code, attackers might inject malicious code to gain control of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations or Misuse of GPUImage in the Application (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_or_misuse_of_gpuimage_in_the_application__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application incorrectly configures or uses GPUImage, rather than flaws within GPUImage itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Unnecessary GPUImage Functionality (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_unnecessary_gpuimage_functionality__high-risk_path_.md)

The application might expose powerful or dangerous GPUImage features to users without proper authorization or input validation, allowing malicious users to abuse them.

## Attack Tree Path: [User triggers a resource-intensive filter causing DoS (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/user_triggers_a_resource-intensive_filter_causing_dos__high-risk_path_.md)

If users can directly trigger computationally expensive filters, attackers can easily cause a Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation Before Passing to GPUImage (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_before_passing_to_gpuimage__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-provided input before passing it to GPUImage functions. This is a fundamental flaw that can enable numerous other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger vulnerabilities in GPUImage due to malformed input (as described above) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerabilities_in_gpuimage_due_to_malformed_input__as_described_above___high-risk_path_.md)

Without proper input validation, the application becomes susceptible to attacks involving malformed image data or other malicious input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Storage or Transmission of Images Processed by GPUImage (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_storage_or_transmission_of_images_processed_by_gpuimage__high-risk_path_.md)

The application stores or transmits images processed by GPUImage without adequate security measures (e.g., encryption). This can lead to the exposure of sensitive information contained within the images.
