# Threat Model Analysis for bradlarson/gpuimage

## Threat: [Malicious Image/Video Input Leading to Buffer Overflow](./threats/malicious_imagevideo_input_leading_to_buffer_overflow.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image or video file with malformed headers or embedded data. This input, when processed by `gpuimage`, triggers a buffer overflow in the underlying native code used for image decoding or processing *within the `gpuimage` library itself*. The attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent memory regions to cause a crash or, in more sophisticated attacks, inject and execute arbitrary code *within the context of the application using `gpuimage`*.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential remote code execution leading to complete system compromise or data breach.

**Affected Component:** Image decoding module (likely within the underlying native libraries used by `gpuimage`), specific filter processing functions that handle pixel data *within `gpuimage`*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `gpuimage` and its underlying native dependencies updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches provided by the `gpuimage` developers.
*   Consider using a separate, well-vetted and hardened library for initial image decoding *before* passing the decoded data to `gpuimage` if the application architecture allows. This can act as a defense in depth.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Image Dimension Calculations](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_image_dimension_calculations.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input (e.g., image dimensions or filter parameters) that, when used in calculations *within `gpuimage`*, results in an integer overflow or underflow. This can lead to incorrect memory allocation sizes or other unexpected behavior *within `gpuimage`'s processing*, potentially resulting in crashes or exploitable memory corruption *within the library's memory space*.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential memory corruption leading to unexpected behavior or exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Internal calculation logic within `gpuimage`, particularly when handling image dimensions and buffer sizes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update `gpuimage` to benefit from bug fixes that might address integer overflow issues.
*   If feasible, contribute to or review the `gpuimage` source code for potential integer overflow vulnerabilities and propose fixes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Native Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_native_libraries.md)

**Description:** `gpuimage` relies on underlying native libraries for graphics processing (e.g., OpenGL ES). If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them *through `gpuimage`*. This could involve providing specific input to `gpuimage` that triggers the vulnerability in the native library *during `gpuimage`'s operation*.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the native library.

**Affected Component:** The specific native graphics library used by `gpuimage` (e.g., the OpenGL ES implementation on the target platform) *as utilized by `gpuimage`*.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the underlying vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the environments where the application runs have up-to-date graphics drivers and operating system components to patch known vulnerabilities in native libraries.
*   Monitor security advisories for the graphics libraries used on the target platforms that are relevant to `gpuimage`'s dependencies.
*   While direct mitigation within the application's code might be limited, staying updated with `gpuimage` releases can sometimes incorporate fixes or workarounds for known issues in its dependencies.
