# Attack Surface Analysis for bradlarson/gpuimage

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Image/Video Input Processing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_imagevideo_input_processing.md)

**Description:** The application processes image or video data using GPUImage. Maliciously crafted input can exploit vulnerabilities in the library's decoding or processing logic.

**How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage handles the decoding and processing of various image and video formats on the GPU. Bugs in this processing can be triggered by unexpected or malformed data.

**Example:** An attacker provides a TIFF image with an intentionally crafted IFD (Image File Directory) that triggers a heap buffer overflow in GPUImage's TIFF parsing routine.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation *before* passing data to GPUImage. Verify file headers, dimensions, and other critical parameters.
*   Consider using a separate, well-vetted image decoding library for initial validation before GPUImage processing.
*   Keep GPUImage updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom GPU Shaders](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_gpu_shaders.md)

**Description:** If the application uses custom GPU shaders with GPUImage, vulnerabilities in these shaders can be exploited.

**How GPUImage Contributes:** GPUImage allows the integration of custom OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) shaders for advanced image processing. Errors in these shaders can introduce security risks.

**Example:** A custom shader contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when accessing a texture, potentially leading to memory corruption on the GPU and potentially affecting other GPU processes.

**Impact:** Denial of service (GPU crash, application crash), potential memory corruption on the GPU, potentially impacting other GPU processes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and audit all custom GPU shader code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Use secure coding practices when writing shaders, paying close attention to array bounds and memory access.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to scan shader code for potential issues.
*   Limit the ability for users to upload or inject arbitrary shader code.
