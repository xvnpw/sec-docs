# Threat Model Analysis for romaonthego/residemenu

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Menu Item Configuration](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_menu_item_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the data used to configure the `residemenu` menu items (e.g., the `title` or `url` properties). This could happen if the application doesn't properly sanitize data before passing it to the `residemenu` initialization. When the menu is rendered by `residemenu`, this malicious script would execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application.

**Affected Component:**  `residemenu` initialization and rendering logic, specifically how it handles the `title` and potentially other configurable properties of menu items.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize and encode user-provided data before using it to populate the `residemenu` configuration. Use context-aware output encoding appropriate for HTML.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, which can help mitigate the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS) in Event Handlers](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__dom_xss__in_event_handlers.md)

**Description:**  An attacker could manipulate the DOM or trigger specific events in a way that exploits vulnerabilities within the `residemenu` library's JavaScript code itself, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript. This might involve crafting specific URLs or interactions that trigger insecure handling of user input within the library's event listeners (e.g., click handlers provided by `residemenu`).

**Impact:** Similar to reflected XSS - account takeover, session hijacking, redirection, data theft, defacement.

**Affected Component:** `residemenu`'s event handling logic, particularly the JavaScript functions within the library that respond to user interactions with the menu.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `residemenu` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Carefully review the library's source code if customization is required, paying close attention to how user input and events are handled within `residemenu`.
*   Avoid modifying the library's core event handling logic unless absolutely necessary and with thorough security review.
