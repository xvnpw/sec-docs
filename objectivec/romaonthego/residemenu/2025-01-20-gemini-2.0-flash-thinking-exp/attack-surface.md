# Attack Surface Analysis for romaonthego/residemenu

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Menu Item Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_menu_item_content.md)

* **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into the content of menu items, which are then executed in the user's browser when the menu is rendered or interacted with.
    * **How ResideMenu Contributes:** ResideMenu is responsible for rendering the HTML content of the menu items. If the application doesn't sanitize user-provided or untrusted data before passing it to ResideMenu for display, the library will faithfully render any included scripts.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a menu item title like `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` or a more sophisticated script. If this title is displayed by ResideMenu without sanitization, the `alert('XSS')` will execute in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:**  Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and the execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser, potentially compromising their account and data.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding on all data used to populate menu item content *before* passing it to ResideMenu. Use browser-provided encoding functions or dedicated sanitization libraries. Ensure all user-provided data is treated as untrusted.

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect via Menu Item Links](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect_via_menu_item_links.md)

* **Description:**  The `href` attribute of a menu item link points to a malicious external site, causing the user to be redirected there when they click the link.
    * **How ResideMenu Contributes:** ResideMenu renders the `<a>` tags for menu items, including the `href` attribute. If the application dynamically generates these links based on user input or untrusted sources without proper validation, ResideMenu will render the malicious link.
    * **Example:** An attacker manipulates the data source for a menu item so that its link becomes `https://evil.com/phishing`. When a user clicks this menu item, they are redirected to the attacker's phishing site.
    * **Impact:** Users can be tricked into visiting phishing sites to steal credentials, download malware, or perform other malicious actions. This can damage the application's reputation and user trust.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**  Implement strict validation and sanitization of URLs used in menu item links. Use a whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns. Avoid directly using user-provided URLs without thorough checks.
