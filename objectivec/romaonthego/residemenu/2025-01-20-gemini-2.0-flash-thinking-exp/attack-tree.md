```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Menu Item Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_menu_item_handling.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Menu Item Handling**

*   This node represents the broad category of attacks that target how the application processes and reacts to user interactions with menu items.
*   A successful compromise at this point allows an attacker to manipulate the intended functionality associated with menu selections.
*   Weaknesses in input validation, insufficient authorization checks, or insecure handling of data passed to menu item actions can be exploited here.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Unintended Actions](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_unintended_actions.md)

**High-Risk Path: Trigger Unintended Actions**

*   This path focuses on the scenario where an attacker can cause the application to perform actions that were not intended by the developer or the user.
*   This is achieved by manipulating the data associated with menu items or the way the application interprets those interactions.
*   The impact can range from accessing restricted features to executing arbitrary code, depending on the specific vulnerabilities exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious Menu Item Data](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_menu_item_data.md)

**Critical Node: Craft Malicious Menu Item Data**

*   This node represents the specific action of an attacker creating and injecting malicious data that is then processed by the application when a menu item is selected.
*   The success of attacks in this category hinges on the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate the data it receives from the menu interaction.
*   This can involve crafting specific strings, URLs, or data structures that exploit known vulnerabilities or bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious URL Schemes](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_url_schemes.md)

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious URL Schemes**

*   This specific high-risk path details how an attacker can inject malicious URL schemes into menu item data.
*   If the application uses a URL handler to process actions triggered by menu items and doesn't properly validate or sanitize these URLs, an attacker can inject schemes like `javascript:` or `file://`.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker crafts a menu item (or manipulates existing menu data if possible) to include a malicious URL scheme.
    *   When the user interacts with this menu item, the application's URL handler attempts to process the malicious URL.
    *   If the handler is vulnerable, this can lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially granting the attacker significant control or access to sensitive data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on whether the application uses URL schemes for menu actions and the robustness of its URL handling.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to perform almost any action the application is capable of.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of URL schemes and the application's URL handling mechanism.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires some technical knowledge of URL handling and potential scripting.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Depends on the logging and monitoring of URL handling within the application. If not properly logged, it can be difficult to detect.
