## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Delegate and Notification Handling (RESideMenu-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_delegate_and_notification_handling__residemenu-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review RESideMenu Delegate Methods:** Examine *only* the implementations of `RESideMenu`'s delegate methods within your project: `willShowMenuViewController`, `didShowMenuViewController`, `willHideMenuViewController`, `didHideMenuViewController`.  These are the points where *RESideMenu* directly communicates with your code.
2.  **Minimize Data in RESideMenu Delegate Calls:**  Ensure that these specific delegate methods do not pass sensitive data as parameters.  If data *must* be passed to your code in response to these events, use the minimum necessary information.  Avoid passing authentication tokens, user details, or other sensitive data directly.
3.  **Indirect Data Access (for RESideMenu Events):** If your code needs to access sensitive data *because* the menu is showing or hiding (as signaled by the `RESideMenu` delegate), use an indirect approach.  For example, the delegate method could set a flag or update a shared (secure) state, and *other* parts of your code could then retrieve the necessary data from a secure store (like Keychain) based on that flag.  Do *not* have the `RESideMenu` delegate method itself directly handle or transmit the sensitive data.
4.  **Review RESideMenu-Related Notification Usage:** If your project uses notifications *specifically triggered by RESideMenu* (check if you're observing notifications related to the library), ensure these notifications do not contain sensitive information in their `userInfo` dictionary. Apply the same indirect data access principle as with delegate methods.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Exposure via RESideMenu Delegate Methods:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Prevents sensitive data from being leaked if a malicious component intercepts *RESideMenu's* delegate method calls. This is specific to the communication between `RESideMenu` and your code.
*   **Data Exposure via RESideMenu-Related Notifications:** (Severity: Medium to High) - Prevents sensitive data from being leaked if a malicious component observes notifications specifically sent by or in response to `RESideMenu`.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Exposure (RESideMenu Delegates/Notifications):** Risk significantly reduced, specifically for data passed through `RESideMenu`'s communication channels.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Specify where this is implemented, focusing on the `RESideMenu` delegate methods and any `RESideMenu`-specific notifications (e.g., "The `didShowMenuViewController` delegate method only sets a boolean flag; it does not pass any user data. No `RESideMenu`-specific notifications are used.").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Specify where this is *not* implemented, again focusing on `RESideMenu`'s communication (e.g., "The `willHideMenuViewController` delegate method currently passes the last selected menu item's data, which includes a user ID. This needs to be refactored.").
*   If fully implemented, state: "No missing implementation."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust RESideMenu State Management](./mitigation_strategies/robust_residemenu_state_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify RESideMenu State Dependencies:** Analyze your code to find all locations where your application's logic depends on the *state of the RESideMenu itself* (i.e., is the menu currently open, closed, or in transition?). This is about how *your* code interacts with `RESideMenu`.
2.  **Use RESideMenu's API for State Checks:**  In all these locations, use `RESideMenu`'s provided API to *explicitly* check the menu's state.  Do *not* make assumptions about the menu's state.  For example, if a certain action should only be allowed when the menu is closed, use `RESideMenu`'s methods (if available) or check the presentation state of the menu's view controller to confirm this *before* performing the action.
3.  **Centralized RESideMenu State Access (if needed):** If your application's logic heavily depends on the `RESideMenu`'s state and this state is accessed from many different parts of your code, consider a centralized approach to manage the `RESideMenu`'s state. This could be a simple boolean flag managed by a singleton, or a more sophisticated state management solution. The key is to ensure that all parts of your code have a consistent view of whether the `RESideMenu` is open or closed. This prevents inconsistencies that could lead to security issues.
4. **Unit Tests (RESideMenu Interaction):** Write unit tests that specifically verify how your code interacts with `RESideMenu` in different states (open, closed, during transitions). These tests should focus on the *interaction* between your code and the `RESideMenu` library.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Logic Errors due to Incorrect RESideMenu State:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents unexpected behavior and potential security bypasses caused by your code making incorrect assumptions about whether the `RESideMenu` is open or closed.
*   **Race Conditions (related to RESideMenu):** (Severity: Medium) - If multiple parts of your code interact with `RESideMenu` asynchronously, proper state management (especially a centralized approach) can help prevent race conditions that could lead to inconsistent behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Logic Errors (RESideMenu State):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Race Conditions (RESideMenu-related):** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Specify where this is implemented, focusing on how your code interacts with `RESideMenu` (e.g., "All code that depends on the menu's state uses a centralized boolean flag that is updated by the `RESideMenu` delegate methods. Unit tests cover these interactions.").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Specify where this is *not* implemented (e.g., "Some parts of the application directly check the `RESideMenu` view controller's presentation state, bypassing the centralized flag. These need to be refactored.").
*   If fully implemented, state: "No missing implementation."
