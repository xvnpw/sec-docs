# Threat Model Analysis for romaonthego/residemenu

## Threat: [Threat 1: XSS via Unsanitized User Input in Menu Items](./threats/threat_1_xss_via_unsanitized_user_input_in_menu_items.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-specific data displayed within the `RESideMenu` (e.g., username, profile details, custom menu item labels). This occurs if `RESideMenu` itself, or the code directly integrating it, fails to sanitize user data before inserting it into the menu's DOM. The attacker could steal cookies, redirect the user, or deface the application.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of user accounts, data theft, session hijacking, website defacement, loss of user trust.
*   **Affected Component:**  The JavaScript code within `RESideMenu` (or tightly coupled integration code) responsible for rendering menu items, specifically the functions that handle dynamic content insertion. This involves DOM manipulation methods like `innerHTML`, `appendChild`, or similar. The vulnerability exists if user data is concatenated with HTML strings *without proper sanitization*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if user input is displayed directly) / High (if only limited, controlled input is displayed, but still without proper sanitization within the RESideMenu context).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization (Within RESideMenu or Integration Code):**  Implement rigorous output encoding/escaping of *all* user-provided data *before* it's passed to `RESideMenu` or inserted into the menu's HTML.  If `RESideMenu` itself handles this data, the sanitization *must* occur within its code. Use a dedicated, well-vetted sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify). Choose the correct encoding method based on the context.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use a strong CSP to restrict script sources. A well-configured CSP can prevent injected script execution even if XSS vulnerabilities exist. Use the `script-src` directive.
    *   **Avoid `innerHTML` (Within RESideMenu):** If modifying `RESideMenu`'s code, prefer safer DOM manipulation methods like `textContent` or `createElement` and `setAttribute` when inserting user data.
    *   **Code Review (RESideMenu and Integration):** Thoroughly review the `RESideMenu` source code *and* any custom code that interacts with it, focusing on user input handling.

## Threat: [Threat 2: UI Redressing / Clickjacking via CSS Manipulation (within RESideMenu)](./threats/threat_2_ui_redressing__clickjacking_via_css_manipulation__within_residemenu_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities *within* `RESideMenu`'s CSS to overlay the menu on top of other interactive elements, tricking the user into clicking on something unintended. This requires a flaw in how `RESideMenu` itself handles its positioning, visibility, or layering.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, potential financial loss, account compromise.
*   **Affected Component:**  The CSS files *specifically belonging to* `RESideMenu` (e.g., `residemenu.css`). Look for issues with `z-index`, `position`, `opacity`, and especially `pointer-events`. The vulnerability is in how *RESideMenu* manages its own visual presentation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful CSS Review (RESideMenu's CSS):** Thoroughly review `RESideMenu`'s CSS for potential vulnerabilities. Use specific and well-defined CSS selectors. Avoid overly broad selectors that could affect elements outside the menu.
    *   **`pointer-events` Property (Within RESideMenu's CSS):** Ensure that when `RESideMenu` intends to hide the menu, it uses `pointer-events: none;` in conjunction with `visibility: hidden;` and `opacity: 0;`. This prevents clicks from passing through the hidden menu *as controlled by RESideMenu's own styling*.
    *   **CSS Linter:** Use a CSS linter to identify potential issues and enforce coding standards within `RESideMenu`'s CSS.
    *   **X-Frame-Options Header (Application-Level):** While this is an application-level mitigation, it's still relevant. Use the `X-Frame-Options` header (or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors`) to control iframe embedding.

## Threat: [Threat 5: Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/threat_5_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** `RESideMenu` might depend on other JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery, animation libraries). If these dependencies have known *critical or high* vulnerabilities, the attacker could exploit them to compromise the application *through* the inclusion of RESideMenu.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from XSS to remote code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `RESideMenu` itself, indirectly, through its reliance on vulnerable dependencies. Examine the `package.json` file (if available) or the source code to identify dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High/Critical (depends on the severity of the dependency vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, yarn) to track and update dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check. *Focus on High and Critical vulnerabilities*.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Promptly apply security updates for all dependencies, especially those with High/Critical vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:** If a dependency is unmaintained or has a history of *serious* security issues, consider replacing `RESideMenu` with a more secure alternative, or forking and maintaining `RESideMenu` yourself, removing the problematic dependency.
