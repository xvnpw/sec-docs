## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___high_risk_.md)

*   **1.2. Memory Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to crash the application by consuming all available memory. This is particularly likely due to the age of the `RE তারাওSideMenu` library, which may have memory management issues.
    *   **1.2.1. Repeated Menu Open/Close [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Rapidly opening and closing the side menu repeatedly.  If the library doesn't properly deallocate resources (views, objects, etc.) each time the menu is closed, this can lead to a memory leak, eventually exhausting available memory and causing a crash.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High (Application crash)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **1.2.3. Trigger retain cycles by exploiting delegate methods [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting the delegate pattern to create retain cycles.  If the `RE তারাওSideMenu` instance holds a strong reference to a delegate, and the delegate also holds a strong reference back to the `RE তারাওSideMenu` (or an object that does), neither object will be deallocated, leading to a memory leak.  This can be triggered by improper handling of delegate assignments or by injecting a malicious delegate.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High (Application crash, slow degradation)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **1.3. Crash by exploiting outdated dependencies [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker leverages known vulnerabilities in outdated third-party libraries used by `RE তারাওSideMenu` or the application.
    *   **1.3.2. Craft input to trigger the vulnerability [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  After identifying a known vulnerability in a dependency, the attacker crafts specific input (e.g., a specially formatted string, a malicious image) that, when processed by the vulnerable library, triggers the vulnerability. This could lead to a crash, or potentially even arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Application crash, potential for code execution)
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Unauthorized Access to Functionality [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__unauthorized_access_to_functionality__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1. Delegate Method Manipulation [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits weaknesses in how the application implements the delegate methods of `RE তারাওSideMenu`.
    *   **2.1.2. Inject Malicious Actions [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  If a delegate method directly executes code based on attacker-controlled input (e.g., a URL, a command string), the attacker can inject malicious code.  For example, if a delegate method takes a URL and opens it in a web view, the attacker could provide a malicious URL that executes JavaScript to steal data or perform other harmful actions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Potential for arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Information Disclosure [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__information_disclosure__high_risk_.md)

*   **3.1. Memory Inspection [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to gain access to sensitive data stored in the application's memory.
    *   **3.1.2. Exploit weak object deallocation to read data from previously used memory [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  If objects containing sensitive data (e.g., authentication tokens, user details) are not properly deallocated or their memory is not securely zeroed out after use, an attacker might be able to read this data from memory. This often involves triggering memory errors or using debugging tools to inspect memory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Potential exposure of sensitive data)
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Bypass Security Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/4__bypass_security_mechanisms.md)

*   **4.1. Intercept or modify the presentation logic**
    *   **Description:** The attacker uses techniques to change the intended behavior of the `RE তারাওSideMenu` library, bypassing security checks or altering its functionality.
    *   **4.1.1. Use method swizzling to alter the behavior of RE তারাওSideMenu methods [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Method swizzling is an Objective-C technique that allows swapping the implementation of methods at runtime. An attacker could use this to replace a legitimate `RE তারাওSideMenu` method (e.g., one that checks user permissions) with a malicious one that always grants access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **4.1.2. Redirect delegate calls to a malicious object [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Similar to method swizzling, this involves manipulating the Objective-C runtime. Instead of swapping method implementations, the attacker changes the delegate object that `RE তারাওSideMenu` uses.  This allows the attacker to intercept all delegate calls and execute their own code instead of the application's intended logic.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
