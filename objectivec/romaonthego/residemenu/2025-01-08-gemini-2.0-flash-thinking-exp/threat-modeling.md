# Threat Model Analysis for romaonthego/residemenu

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Menu Item Configuration](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_menu_item_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into menu item labels, links, or other configurable properties of the `residemenu`. This is possible if the `residemenu` library itself doesn't properly sanitize or escape these configuration values before rendering them into the DOM. When a user interacts with the affected menu item, the malicious script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Account takeover by stealing cookies or session tokens.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Defacement of the application.
        *   Information theft by accessing local storage or session storage.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `options` parameter used during `residemenu` initialization, specifically properties like `title` or any custom HTML handling within the library's rendering logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization within ResideMenu:** The `residemenu` library should implement proper sanitization and escaping of all configurable values before rendering them into the DOM.
        *   **Security Reviews of ResideMenu Code:**  Developers using the library can review its source code to understand how configuration values are handled and identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Potential Vulnerabilities within the `residemenu` Library](./threats/exploiting_potential_vulnerabilities_within_the__residemenu__library.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `residemenu` library's JavaScript code. This could involve crafting specific input to trigger unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the library's internal logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unpredictable, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from UI issues to potential client-side code execution within the context of the web application.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Any part of the `residemenu` library's codebase containing the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Library Updated:** Regularly update the `residemenu` library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the maintainers.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to `residemenu`.
        *   **Code Audits of ResideMenu:** For high-security applications, consider performing or commissioning code audits of the `residemenu` library to identify potential vulnerabilities proactively.
