## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content into Menu Items - Detailed Breakdown](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_menu_items_-_detailed_breakdown.md)

*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Content into Menu Items
    *   Description: An attacker attempts to inject malicious content (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, malicious URLs) into the data displayed within menu items. This is particularly relevant when using custom views or displaying dynamic content.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Custom Menu Views
        *   Description: If the application does not properly sanitize user-provided or dynamically loaded data before displaying it in custom menu views, an attacker can inject malicious scripts or links.
        *   Action: Inject script tags or malicious URLs in custom view data.
            *   Details: An attacker crafts malicious input containing script tags (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) or malicious URLs that, when rendered by the application, can execute arbitrary code within the application's context or redirect the user to a malicious site.
            *   Potential Impact: Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
            *   Mitigation: Implement robust input sanitization techniques, such as encoding special characters and validating input against expected formats. Use secure rendering methods that prevent the execution of embedded scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Menu Item Actions/Callbacks - Detailed Breakdown](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_menu_item_actionscallbacks_-_detailed_breakdown.md)

*   Attack Vector: Manipulate Menu Item Actions/Callbacks
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Weaknesses in Delegate/Callback Implementation
        *   Description: Attackers target vulnerabilities in how the application handles delegate methods or callbacks associated with menu item selections. If these mechanisms are not properly secured, attackers might be able to trigger unintended actions.
        *   Action: If the application's delegate methods are not properly secured, an attacker might find ways to trigger them with malicious data.
            *   Details: An attacker attempts to trigger delegate methods with crafted data or in an unexpected sequence, potentially bypassing security checks or causing unintended state changes within the application. This could involve manipulating touch events or exploiting vulnerabilities in the event handling mechanism.
            *   Potential Impact: Unauthorized actions performed within the application, data modification, or bypassing intended application logic. The impact depends heavily on the functionality associated with the vulnerable delegate method.
            *   Mitigation: Implement strong validation of data received in delegate methods. Ensure that delegate calls are only triggered under expected conditions and with trusted data. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning responsibilities to delegate methods.
