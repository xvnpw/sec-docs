# Attack Surface Analysis for romaonthego/residemenu

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Menu Item Content Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_menu_item_content_injection.md)

**Description:**  If the application dynamically generates menu items based on user input or data from untrusted sources, an attacker could inject malicious content into the menu item titles or subtitles.

**How ResideMenu Contributes:** ResideMenu is responsible for rendering the menu items provided to it. It will display whatever content is given, without inherent sanitization.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a username that, when displayed in the ResideMenu, includes a `<script>` tag. When the menu is rendered (especially if using a web view within the menu), this script could execute, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding for any data used to generate menu items. Sanitize user-provided content before displaying it in the menu. Avoid rendering untrusted content in web views within the menu if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Action Handling via Menu Items](./attack_surfaces/insecure_action_handling_via_menu_items.md)

**Description:** The actions associated with tapping menu items are defined by the application developer. If these actions are not implemented securely, they can be exploited.

**How ResideMenu Contributes:** ResideMenu triggers the action (e.g., a selector or closure) that the developer has associated with a specific menu item tap. It acts as the entry point for these actions.

**Example:** A menu item is supposed to open a user profile based on an ID embedded in the menu item's associated data. If this ID is not properly validated, an attacker could manipulate the menu structure or intercept the action trigger to inject a different user ID, potentially accessing unauthorized profiles.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, or execution of unintended application functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developer:** Implement robust authorization checks before performing any action triggered by a menu item. Validate and sanitize any data received from the menu item or its associated context before using it in critical operations. Follow the principle of least privilege when defining menu actions.
