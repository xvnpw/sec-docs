## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Z-Index Management for `residemenu` UI Redressing Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/implement_z-index_management_for__residemenu__ui_redressing_prevention.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Inspect `residemenu` Z-Index:** Examine the default `z-index` of `residemenu`'s elements within your application's layout. Understand how `residemenu` is positioned in the stacking context.
2.  **Define `residemenu` Z-Index Hierarchy:** Establish a clear `z-index` hierarchy that explicitly positions `residemenu` and its interactive elements relative to other UI components. Ensure `residemenu` is above background elements but appropriately layered with foreground elements.
3.  **Explicitly Set `residemenu` Z-Index:** In your application's styling or code, explicitly set `z-index` values for `residemenu` and any potentially overlapping UI elements to control layering and prevent unintended obscuring of `residemenu`'s interactive parts.
4.  **Test `residemenu` with Overlays:**  Specifically test scenarios where other UI elements (dialogs, pop-ups, custom views) are displayed on top of or alongside `residemenu`. Verify that `residemenu`'s buttons and interactive areas remain clickable and are not susceptible to clickjacking due to incorrect layering.
5.  **Audit `residemenu` Z-Index on UI Changes:** Whenever you modify the UI layout, especially around the area where `residemenu` is integrated, re-audit the `z-index` settings to ensure the intended layering of `residemenu` is maintained and no new redressing vulnerabilities are introduced.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **UI Redressing/Clickjacking via `residemenu` Layering (Medium Severity):** Attackers could exploit incorrect `z-index` configuration to overlay malicious elements on top of `residemenu`, tricking users into unintended actions when interacting with the menu.

**Impact:**
*   **UI Redressing/Clickjacking (High Reduction):**  Proper `z-index` management specifically for `residemenu` effectively prevents UI redressing attacks targeting interactions with the menu.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. We have general `z-index` awareness, but haven't specifically focused on defining and testing a robust `z-index` strategy *around* `residemenu` integration.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Missing a documented `z-index` strategy that explicitly addresses `residemenu` layering and potential overlay scenarios.
*   Missing dedicated test cases to verify `residemenu`'s resistance to clickjacking due to `z-index` issues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Sensitive Data Displayed in `residemenu` Content](./mitigation_strategies/control_sensitive_data_displayed_in__residemenu__content.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review `residemenu` Content for Sensitive Data:**  Specifically audit all text, icons, and visual elements within `residemenu` items. Identify any instances where sensitive user data or application secrets are directly displayed in the menu.
2.  **Minimize Sensitive Data in `residemenu`:**  Reduce the amount of sensitive information shown directly in `residemenu`.  If possible, remove sensitive data entirely from the menu or replace it with less revealing alternatives.
3.  **Mask/Abstract Sensitive Data in `residemenu`:** If sensitive data *must* be shown in `residemenu`, apply masking or abstraction techniques. For example, truncate long strings, show only the initial characters, or use generic placeholders instead of full sensitive values within the menu items.
4.  **Contextual Sensitivity for `residemenu` Display:** Consider the contexts where `residemenu` is visible (e.g., app switcher, notifications). Avoid displaying sensitive information in `residemenu` that could be exposed in these less secure contexts.
5.  **Secure Data Handling for `residemenu` Population:** Ensure that when populating `residemenu` with data, sensitive information is handled securely in the data retrieval and processing stages *before* it is displayed in the menu. Avoid hardcoding sensitive data directly into `residemenu` item definitions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure via `residemenu` Content (Medium Severity):** Sensitive data inadvertently displayed in `residemenu` can be exposed to unauthorized individuals through casual observation, app switcher previews, or screen sharing, if the menu content is not carefully controlled.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure (High Reduction):**  Minimizing and masking sensitive data specifically within `residemenu` content significantly reduces the risk of unintentional information leaks through the menu UI.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. We generally avoid displaying highly sensitive data in the UI, but haven't specifically audited the *content of `residemenu` items* for potential sensitive data exposure.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Missing a dedicated audit of the data displayed within `residemenu` items for sensitive information.
*   Missing guidelines on acceptable data types and masking requirements for content displayed in `residemenu`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize `residemenu` Performance to Prevent UI Degradation](./mitigation_strategies/optimize__residemenu__performance_to_prevent_ui_degradation.md)

1.  **`residemenu` Performance Profiling:** Use performance profiling tools to specifically analyze the performance of `residemenu` in your application. Identify any performance bottlenecks related to `residemenu`'s animations, rendering, or item handling.
2.  **Optimize `residemenu` Animations:** Review the animations and transitions used by `residemenu`. Ensure they are performant, especially on lower-end devices. Simplify or optimize `residemenu` animations if they are causing performance issues.
3.  **Efficient `residemenu` Item Rendering:** Ensure that the views used for `residemenu` items are rendered efficiently. Avoid complex layouts or resource-intensive operations within each `residemenu` item's view to maintain smooth menu performance.
4.  **Test `residemenu` Performance with Scale:** Test `residemenu` performance with a realistic number of menu items and under typical usage scenarios to ensure it remains responsive and doesn't degrade UI performance.
5.  **Resource Monitoring during `residemenu` Usage:** Monitor CPU, memory, and battery usage specifically when `residemenu` is opened, interacted with, and animated. Identify any excessive resource consumption caused by `residemenu`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **UI-Related Denial of Service due to `residemenu` (Low Severity):**  Resource-intensive operations within `residemenu` (e.g., complex animations, inefficient rendering) could theoretically lead to UI freezes or application unresponsiveness, causing a temporary denial of service *specifically related to the menu*.

**Impact:**
*   **UI-Related Denial of Service (Medium Reduction):** Optimizing `residemenu`'s performance reduces the risk of UI degradation and potential unresponsiveness caused by the menu itself, ensuring a smoother user experience.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. We generally aim for good UI performance, but haven't specifically profiled and optimized the performance of *`residemenu` in particular*.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Missing dedicated performance profiling and testing focused specifically on `residemenu`.
*   Missing specific optimizations for `residemenu` animations and item rendering based on performance testing results.
