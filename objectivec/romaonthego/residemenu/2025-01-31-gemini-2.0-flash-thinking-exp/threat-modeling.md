# Threat Model Analysis for romaonthego/residemenu

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via DOM Manipulation](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_dom_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into menu items or content that is processed and rendered by `residemenu`. If `residemenu` does not properly sanitize or escape this input before injecting it into the DOM, the attacker's script will execute in the user's browser. This could be achieved by manipulating data sources used to populate the menu, or through application vulnerabilities that allow injecting data into menu configurations.

**Impact:** Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.

**ResideMenu Component Affected:** Menu rendering module, specifically the functions responsible for dynamically creating and updating menu item elements in the DOM.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all data used to populate the `residemenu`, especially if it originates from user input or external sources. Use browser-provided sanitization functions or a reputable sanitization library to remove or escape potentially malicious HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Output Encoding:** Ensure proper output encoding when rendering dynamic content within `residemenu`. Encode data to prevent it from being interpreted as executable code by the browser.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ResideMenu Library Dependencies or Core Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_residemenu_library_dependencies_or_core_code.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, `residemenu` or its dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers if they are discovered and publicly disclosed. Attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to execute malicious code, gain unauthorized access, or cause other security breaches.

**Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in `residemenu` could lead to various security breaches, including XSS, arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**ResideMenu Component Affected:** Potentially any module or function within the library, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability type)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for known vulnerabilities in `residemenu` and its dependencies.
*   **Keep Library Updated:** Keep the `residemenu` library and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automatically scan the application's dependencies, including `residemenu`, for known vulnerabilities and receive alerts about potential risks.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the application and its dependencies, including `residemenu`, to identify potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.
