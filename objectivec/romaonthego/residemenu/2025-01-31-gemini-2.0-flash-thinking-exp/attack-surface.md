# Attack Surface Analysis for romaonthego/residemenu

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Menu Content Injection](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_menu_content_injection.md)

**Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into the menu content, leading to execution in the user's browser. This occurs when the application provides unsanitized data to ResideMenu for rendering menu items.
*   **ResideMenu Contribution:** ResideMenu directly renders the menu structure based on the configuration provided by the application. It will execute any JavaScript code embedded within the menu content if the application doesn't sanitize inputs.
*   **Example:** An application uses user-provided names for menu items. If an attacker sets their name to `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` and this name is used as a menu item title without sanitization, ResideMenu will render this, causing the JavaScript alert to execute when the menu is displayed.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, data theft, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided or dynamically generated content *before* passing it to ResideMenu for rendering. Use HTML entity encoding or a robust sanitization library to escape HTML special characters.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly limiting the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   **Template Engines with Auto-Escaping:** Utilize template engines that automatically escape output by default when generating menu configurations, preventing accidental XSS injection.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based XSS through Menu Configuration Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_xss_through_menu_configuration_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of client-side JavaScript to dynamically modify the ResideMenu configuration with malicious scripts after initial rendering, resulting in DOM-based XSS. This happens if the application uses unsanitized data to update the menu structure via ResideMenu's API.
*   **ResideMenu Contribution:** ResideMenu's API allows for dynamic updates to the menu structure. If the application uses client-side JavaScript to modify the menu configuration based on unsanitized data and then applies these changes through ResideMenu's API, it can introduce DOM-based XSS.
*   **Example:** An application fetches menu item labels from an external API and updates the ResideMenu dynamically. If the API response contains malicious JavaScript and the client-side code directly sets these labels without sanitization using ResideMenu's API, DOM-based XSS will occur.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, data theft, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Client-Side Data Handling:** Treat all client-side data, especially data from external sources or user interactions, as untrusted. Sanitize and validate this data *before* using it to dynamically modify the ResideMenu configuration.
    *   **Minimize Dynamic Menu Modifications:** Reduce or avoid dynamic modifications to ResideMenu based on user input. Prefer server-side generation or pre-defined configurations whenever possible to limit client-side manipulation risks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Client-Side JavaScript:** Conduct regular security audits of the client-side JavaScript code that interacts with ResideMenu to identify and remediate potential DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities introduced through dynamic updates.

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect via Menu Item Links](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect_via_menu_item_links.md)

**Description:** Abuse of unsanitized URLs in menu item links to redirect users to attacker-controlled websites. This vulnerability arises when the application allows untrusted sources to define the URLs for menu items rendered by ResideMenu.
*   **ResideMenu Contribution:** ResideMenu renders menu items as standard HTML `<a>` tags. If the application provides unsanitized URLs for the `href` attribute of these links, ResideMenu will directly use them, creating an open redirect vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An application allows administrators to configure menu items and their associated URLs. If URL validation is missing, an attacker with admin privileges could set a menu item URL to `https://malicious.example.com`. When a user clicks this menu item in the ResideMenu, they will be redirected to the attacker's malicious site.
*   **Impact:** Phishing attacks, malware distribution, credential theft, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all URLs used in menu item links. Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or URL schemes. Sanitize URLs to prevent manipulation and ensure they point to intended, safe destinations.
    *   **Prefer Relative URLs:**  For links within the application, use relative URLs instead of absolute URLs to reduce the risk of open redirects.
    *   **Implement a Redirect Interceptor:** Consider implementing a client-side redirect interceptor to validate the destination URL before actually redirecting the user, providing an additional layer of security against open redirect attacks.
