# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a software library called `residemenu` which provides a side menu (also known as a drawer menu or hamburger menu) for Android applications. The primary business goal of such a library is to enhance the user interface and user experience of Android applications by providing a common and intuitive navigation pattern.

Business priorities for this project are:
- Ease of integration: The library should be easy for Android developers to incorporate into their existing projects.
- Customization: The library should offer sufficient customization options to allow developers to tailor the menu's appearance and behavior to match their application's design.
- Performance: The library should be performant and not introduce noticeable overhead or lag into the host application.
- Stability and Reliability: The library should be stable and reliable, minimizing crashes or unexpected behavior in applications that use it.
- Open Source Community Support: As an open-source project, community support, contributions, and maintenance are important for its long-term viability and adoption.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library code could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using the library, potentially leading to application compromise or data breaches.
- Compatibility issues with different Android versions or devices could lead to application instability or poor user experience.
- Poor performance of the library could negatively impact the overall performance of applications using it, leading to user dissatisfaction.
- Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated or insecure over time.
- Improper usage of the library by developers could introduce security vulnerabilities into the host applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open Source Code Review - The code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny.
- security control: GitHub Repository - Utilizing GitHub provides basic version control and issue tracking.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the code.
- accepted risk: Risk of insecure integration by developers using the library.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `residemenu`.
- recommended security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Secure Code Review Process - Establish a formal secure code review process, involving security-minded developers, for all code changes before they are merged.
- recommended security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Create a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to allow security researchers and users to report potential security issues responsibly.
- recommended security control: Security Testing - Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and fuzzing, to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Secure Development Guidelines - Document and follow secure development guidelines for the project, educating contributors on secure coding practices.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using the library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a UI library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using the library.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Validate any input parameters or configurations provided to the library by developers to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This includes validating menu item properties, animation parameters, and styling attributes.
    - security requirement: If the library handles any user-provided content (e.g., custom view for menu items), ensure proper sanitization and validation to prevent injection attacks.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of a UI library like `residemenu`. If future features require cryptography, ensure proper implementation using well-vetted libraries and best practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Reliable and user-friendly navigation in Android applications using the `residemenu` library.
- Maintaining the reputation and trustworthiness of the `residemenu` open-source project.
- Ensuring the security and stability of applications that integrate the `residemenu` library.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of the `residemenu` library: Sensitivity is medium. Confidentiality is less critical as it's open source, but integrity and availability are crucial to prevent malicious modifications and ensure project continuity.
- Library artifacts (JAR/AAR files) in package repositories: Sensitivity is medium. Integrity and availability are critical to ensure developers download legitimate and unmodified library versions.
- Project infrastructure (CI/CD configurations, build environments): Sensitivity is medium to high. Integrity and confidentiality are important to prevent unauthorized access and modifications that could compromise the build process or introduce vulnerabilities.
- User data is not directly handled by the `residemenu` library itself. However, vulnerabilities in the library could indirectly impact the security of user data in applications that use it. The sensitivity of user data depends on the specific application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended scope and scale of usage for the `residemenu` library? Is it intended for use in hobby projects, small applications, or large enterprise-level applications?
- Are there any specific security compliance requirements or industry standards that the library or applications using it need to adhere to?
- What is the expected level of security expertise among developers who will be contributing to or using the library?
- Are there any specific concerns or priorities regarding security for this project beyond general best practices?
- What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the library once it is in use?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a useful and reliable UI component for Android developers to enhance user experience. The project is community-driven and open-source.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are basic, relying on open-source community review. There is an accepted risk of potential undiscovered vulnerabilities. Recommended security controls are considered high priority to improve the security posture. Security requirements focus on input validation and secure coding practices within the library.
- DESIGN: The design is relatively simple, focusing on modular components within the library. Deployment is through standard package repositories for Android libraries. The build process is assumed to be automated using CI/CD practices.
