### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving RESideMenu

*   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Menu Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker might observe sensitive information displayed within the RESideMenu when it's open due to the library directly rendering the provided content. This occurs if developers mistakenly place sensitive data directly in menu item labels or custom views managed by RESideMenu. The library's rendering mechanism makes this data visible when the menu is active.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage depending on the nature of the exposed data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Menu Item View, Custom Content View (managed and rendered by RESideMenu)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid displaying sensitive data directly in the content provided to RESideMenu for rendering.
        *   If sensitive data must be displayed, implement appropriate masking or redaction *before* passing the data to RESideMenu.
        *   Ensure proper handling of view lifecycle and data binding in components managed by RESideMenu to prevent accidental exposure during transitions controlled by the library.

*   **Threat:** Injection Attacks via Dynamically Generated Menu Content
    *   **Description:** If the content of the RESideMenu is dynamically generated and the library is used to render this content without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code (e.g., HTML, JavaScript if using web views within the menu provided to RESideMenu). The library's rendering process would then execute this malicious code within the menu's context.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity violation, potential information disclosure, session hijacking, or execution of arbitrary code within the application's context, facilitated by RESideMenu's rendering of the malicious content.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Binding to Menu Items (rendered by RESideMenu), Custom Content View (if using web views rendered by RESideMenu)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and encode user input and external data *before* passing it to RESideMenu for display.
        *   If using web views within the menu managed by RESideMenu, implement robust content security policies (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks within the rendered content.
        *   Avoid directly embedding untrusted HTML or scripts in the data provided to RESideMenu.
