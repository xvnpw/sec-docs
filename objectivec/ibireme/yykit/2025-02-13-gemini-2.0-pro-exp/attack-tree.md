## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploiting YYImage (Image Processing) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploiting_yyimage__image_processing___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities within YYKit's image processing component, `YYImage`.  The primary concern is with image decoding, where a maliciously crafted image file can exploit vulnerabilities in the decoding process (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows) to achieve arbitrary code execution.  Exploiting format conversion vulnerabilities relies on finding and leveraging weaknesses in the underlying libraries that YYImage uses for formats like WebP or APNG.

*   **1.1.1 Image Decoding Vulnerability [CRITICAL]**
    *   **1.1.1.1 Craft malicious image file:**
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate to Advanced

        *   *Effort:* Very Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Easy

*   **1.1.3 Exploiting Image Format Conversion [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **1.1.3.1 Identify vulnerabilities in underlying libraries [CRITICAL]:**
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* High
        *   *Skill Level:* Advanced to Expert
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard
    *   **1.1.3.2 Craft malicious image:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploiting YYModel (Model Mapping) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploiting_yymodel__model_mapping___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector targets `YYModel`, YYKit's component for mapping data (like JSON) to model objects.  The most significant risk is a deserialization vulnerability, particularly if custom deserialization logic is implemented.  If an attacker can control the input data used for deserialization, they might be able to inject malicious code.

*   **1.2.1 Deserialization Vulnerability [CRITICAL]**
    *   **1.2.1.1 Craft malicious JSON/data payload:**
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate to Advanced
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **1.2.1.2 Trigger model mapping:**
        *   *Likelihood:* High
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Very Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploiting YYCache (Caching)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploiting_yycache__caching_.md)

*    **Description:** This attack vector focuses on `YYCache`. The critical vulnerability here is similar to the YYModel deserialization issue: if objects are cached and then deserialized without proper validation, an attacker could inject malicious code by manipulating the cached data.

*   **1.3.2 Deserialization Vulnerability [CRITICAL]**
    *   **1.3.2.1 Store malicious serialized object:**
        *   *Likelihood:* Low to Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* High
        *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard
    *   **1.3.2.2 Retrieve and deserialize:**
        *   *Likelihood:* High
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Very Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Exploiting YYText (Rich Text) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_exploiting_yytext__rich_text___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector targets `YYText`, YYKit's rich text component.  The primary concern is an XSS-like vulnerability. If `YYText` is used to render untrusted input that contains HTML-like structures or scripting elements, and this content is then displayed in a `UIWebView` or `WKWebView`, it could lead to the execution of malicious scripts within the web view's context.

*   **1.4.1 XSS-like Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **1.4.1.1 Craft malicious text:**
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   **1.4.1.2 Render the malicious text [CRITICAL]:**
        *   *Likelihood:* High
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Effort:* Very Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Easy
