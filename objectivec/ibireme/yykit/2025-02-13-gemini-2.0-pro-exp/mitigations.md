# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ibireme/yykit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Image Input Validation and Sanitization for YYImage/YYAnimatedImageView](./mitigation_strategies/strict_image_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_yyimageyyanimatedimageview.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Allowed Types:** Before using `YYImage` or `YYAnimatedImageView`, create a list of explicitly allowed image MIME types (e.g., `["image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif", "image/webp"]`).
2.  **Check File Header (Magic Numbers):** Before passing data to `YYImage imageWithData:` or similar methods, read the first few bytes of the image data and verify the file signature against known headers for the declared type. Do *not* rely solely on file extensions.
3.  **Size Limits (File and Dimensions):**
    *   Set a maximum file size limit *before* passing data to YYKit.
    *   After creating a `YYImage` (but before displaying it in a `YYAnimatedImageView`), check the `size` property (which represents the decoded image dimensions) and reject images exceeding predefined maximum width and height.
4.  **Re-encode (Optional, but Recommended):** After validating, consider re-encoding the image using `YYImage`'s encoding methods (e.g., `yy_imageWithData:scale:`) to a standard format and quality. This can help remove malicious embedded data. This is done *using YYKit itself*.
5. **Avoid `imageWithContentsOfFile` for Untrusted Sources:** If loading images from potentially untrusted sources (e.g., user uploads), *avoid* using `YYImage imageWithContentsOfFile:` directly.  Instead, load the file data into an `NSData` object *first*, perform the validation steps above, and *then* use `YYImage imageWithData:`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malformed Image Exploits (High Severity):** Prevents attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in YYKit's image decoding (or its underlying libraries) via crafted image files.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessively large images from causing resource exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Similar to DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malformed Image Exploits:** Significantly reduces risk (80-90%).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Substantially reduces risk (70-80%).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Substantially reduces risk (70-80%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *File type check based on extension before using `YYAnimatedImageView` in `ImageViewController.swift`.* (Example)

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Magic number validation is missing before using `YYImage`.*
    *   *Image dimension checks after `YYImage` creation are not implemented.*
    *   *Re-encoding using `YYImage` is not implemented.*
    *   *`imageWithContentsOfFile` is used directly with potentially untrusted URLs in `RemoteImageLoader.m`.* (Example - This is a major vulnerability).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Text Input Handling for YYText (YYLabel, YYTextView)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_text_input_handling_for_yytext__yylabel__yytextview_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Input Validation (Crucial for User Input):** If `YYLabel` or `YYTextView` displays user-provided text, *rigorously* sanitize and validate this input *before* setting the `text` or `attributedText` properties.
2.  **Whitelist Approach:** Use a whitelist to restrict allowed characters, formatting tags (if using attributed strings), and attributes. Avoid blacklisting.
3.  **Length Limits:** Enforce maximum length limits on user-provided text to prevent excessively long strings that could cause performance issues or DoS when rendered by YYText.
4.  **Contextual Output Encoding (If Mixing Data):** If user-provided data is combined with application-controlled data within a `YYLabel` or `YYTextView`, ensure proper encoding for the context to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) or similar vulnerabilities. This is less about YYKit itself and more about how you *use* the output from YYText.
5. **Avoid Direct HTML/Rich Text Input:** If possible, avoid allowing users to directly input HTML or other rich text formats that will be rendered by YYText. If you must, use a very strict whitelist of allowed tags and attributes, and consider using a dedicated HTML sanitizer *before* passing the data to YYText.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malformed Text Exploits (High Severity):** Prevents attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in YYText's text rendering and layout engine.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity - If applicable):** Prevents XSS if user input is displayed without proper sanitization. This is relevant if YYText is used to display web-like content.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessively long or complex text from causing performance issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malformed Text Exploits:** High risk reduction (70-90%, with thorough validation).
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High risk reduction (80-90%, with proper sanitization).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Moderate risk reduction (50-70%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Basic length limits are enforced on user comments displayed in `YYLabel` in `CommentViewController.m`.* (Example)

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *No whitelist-based sanitization is performed.* This is a critical gap.
    *   *No contextual output encoding is used when combining user input with other data.*
    *   *Users can input limited HTML, which is passed directly to `YYTextView` in `PostEditorViewController.swift`.* (Example - This is a major vulnerability).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure YYModel JSON Parsing and Validation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_yymodel_json_parsing_and_validation.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Schema Validation (Recommended):** Before using `YYModel` to parse JSON, validate the JSON structure and data types against a predefined JSON schema. This is the *most robust* approach.
2.  **Property Whitelisting (Essential):** Use `YYModel`'s `+ (NSDictionary *)modelCustomPropertyMapper` (or `+ (NSDictionary *)modelContainerPropertyGenericClass` for collections) to *explicitly* define which JSON keys are allowed to be mapped to model properties. *Ignore* any unexpected keys. This is a core feature of `YYModel` and *must* be used correctly.
3.  **Type Enforcement:** Define clear data types for your model properties. `YYModel` will attempt type conversions; handle any conversion errors gracefully.
4.  **Range/Value Checks (After YYModel Parsing):** *After* `YYModel` has parsed the JSON and populated your model object, perform additional validation checks on the property values. Check for:
    *   Valid ranges for numeric values.
    *   Non-empty strings where required.
    *   Valid date ranges.
    *   Any other business-logic-specific constraints.
5. **Avoid Deeply Nested/Recursive Models (If Possible):** While YYModel can handle nested objects, overly complex or deeply recursive models can increase the attack surface. If possible, simplify your data models.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Object Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious objects via crafted JSON.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected modification of data.
    *   **Unexpected Input Handling (Medium Severity):** Ensures graceful handling of invalid JSON.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Object Injection:** High risk reduction (80-90%, with schema validation and property whitelisting).
    *   **Data Tampering:** Moderate risk reduction (50-70%).
    *   **Unexpected Input Handling:** Moderate risk reduction (40-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *`+ (NSDictionary *)modelCustomPropertyMapper` is used in `User.m` and `Product.m`.* (Example)
    *   *YYModel's built-in type checking is relied upon.* (Example)

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *No JSON schema validation is used before calling `YYModel` methods.* This is a significant gap.
    *   *No additional range/value checks are performed *after* `YYModel` parsing.* This is important for business logic validation.
    *   *A deeply nested model (`Order.m`) is used without sufficient validation.* (Example)
