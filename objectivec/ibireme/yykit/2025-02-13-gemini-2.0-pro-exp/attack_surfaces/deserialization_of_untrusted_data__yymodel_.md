# Deep Analysis: Deserialization of Untrusted Data (YYModel) in YYKit

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Deserialization of Untrusted Data" attack surface related to the `YYModel` component of the YYKit library.  We aim to:

*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
*   Assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Provide concrete recommendations for secure implementation.
*   Highlight potential pitfalls and edge cases.
*   Determine residual risks after mitigation.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the deserialization functionality provided by `YYModel` within YYKit.  It considers:

*   The `YYModel` API methods related to deserialization (e.g., `modelWithJSON:`, `modelWithDictionary:`).
*   The interaction of `YYModel` with Objective-C runtime features (reflection, key-value coding).
*   The impact of different data formats (primarily JSON, but also potentially property lists).
*   The context of iOS application development.
*   The provided mitigation strategies.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other components of YYKit unrelated to `YYModel`.
*   General iOS security best practices outside the scope of deserialization.
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *other than* YYKit.
*   Network-level attacks (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle) that could lead to data tampering *before* it reaches `YYModel`.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examine the source code of `YYModel` (available on GitHub) to understand its internal workings and identify potential weaknesses.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., Xcode's built-in analyzer, Infer) to detect potential vulnerabilities.  (Note: This is limited by the dynamic nature of Objective-C.)
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  Describe potential dynamic analysis techniques (e.g., fuzzing, runtime instrumentation) that could be used to further test the library.  We won't perform actual dynamic analysis in this document, but we'll outline how it could be done.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Systematically identify potential threats and attack scenarios.
*   **Best Practices Review:**  Compare the implementation and recommended usage against established secure coding guidelines for Objective-C and iOS.
*   **Documentation Review:** Analyze the official YYKit documentation and any relevant community discussions.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1 Attack Vectors and Vulnerabilities

The primary attack vector is the injection of maliciously crafted JSON (or other supported formats) that, when deserialized by `YYModel`, leads to unintended consequences.  Here's a breakdown of specific vulnerabilities:

*   **Unintended Class Instantiation:**  The most critical vulnerability.  `YYModel` uses Objective-C's runtime to create instances of classes based on the input data.  If an attacker can control the class name specified in the JSON, they can potentially instantiate *any* class in the application's runtime environment.  This is particularly dangerous if:
    *   The attacker-chosen class has a vulnerable `init` method (or any initializer).
    *   The class conforms to a protocol that triggers specific application logic upon instantiation.
    *   The class overrides methods like `setValue:forKey:` or `setValue:forUndefinedKey:` in a way that can be exploited.
    *   The class has properties with custom setters that perform dangerous actions.

*   **Type Confusion:**  Even with a class whitelist, an attacker might be able to exploit type confusion.  For example, if the application expects a `NSString`, but the attacker provides a `NSNumber` that, when treated as a string, leads to a crash or unexpected behavior.  This is less likely to lead to RCE, but can cause denial of service or data corruption.

*   **Resource Exhaustion (DoS):**  An attacker could provide extremely large JSON payloads or deeply nested structures.  `YYModel` might attempt to allocate excessive memory, leading to application crashes or system instability.

*   **Property Injection (Less Likely, but Possible):**  If the application uses custom setters for properties, and these setters have vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to trigger those vulnerabilities by providing specific values for those properties in the JSON.

*   **Key-Value Coding (KVC) Exploits:**  `YYModel` relies heavily on KVC.  While KVC itself is a core Objective-C feature, vulnerabilities can arise if the application's model classes don't properly handle unexpected keys or values.  This includes:
    *   `setValue:forUndefinedKey:`:  If not implemented correctly, this can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   `valueForUndefinedKey:`: Similar to the above.
    *   Key Path Injection:  If the attacker can control key paths used in KVC, they might be able to access or modify data they shouldn't.

### 2.2 Mitigation Strategy Analysis

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the provided mitigation strategies:

*   **Mandatory Class Whitelisting (`modelSetClassWhitelist`)**:  This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  By explicitly specifying the allowed classes, you drastically reduce the attack surface.  However, it's important to:
    *   **Be Exhaustive:**  Ensure *all* possible classes that might be deserialized are included in the whitelist.  This includes classes used in nested objects.
    *   **Regularly Review:**  As the application evolves and new model classes are added, the whitelist must be updated.
    *   **Avoid Wildcards:**  Do *not* use wildcards or overly broad class names in the whitelist.  Be as specific as possible.
    *   **Consider Subclasses:** If you whitelist a class, remember that its subclasses will also be allowed unless you specifically exclude them.

*   **Strict Input Validation (Before and After Deserialization)**:  This is essential for preventing type confusion and other data-related issues.
    *   **Before Deserialization:**  Use a schema validation library (like JSON Schema) to validate the structure and data types of the JSON *before* passing it to `YYModel`.  This can prevent many attacks early on.
    *   **After Deserialization:**  Validate the properties of the deserialized objects to ensure they contain expected values.  Check for:
        *   Data types (e.g., is this string actually a string?).
        *   Ranges (e.g., is this number within the expected bounds?).
        *   Lengths (e.g., is this string too long?).
        *   Allowed values (e.g., is this enum value valid?).
        *   Sanity checks (e.g., does this combination of values make sense?).

*   **Limit Data Size:**  This is a good defense against resource exhaustion attacks.  Set a reasonable limit on the size of the JSON data that the application will accept.  This can be done at the network layer (e.g., using a web server configuration) or within the application code.

*   **Avoid Deserializing Complex, Nested Structures from Untrusted Sources:**  This is a good general principle.  If possible, simplify the data format or use a different parsing method for untrusted data.  For example, you could use a custom parser that only extracts the specific data you need, rather than deserializing the entire structure into objects.

### 2.3 Residual Risks

Even with all the mitigation strategies in place, some residual risks remain:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in YYModel:**  There's always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the `YYModel` code itself.  Regularly updating to the latest version of YYKit is important.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Whitelisted Classes:**  Even if a class is whitelisted, it might still have vulnerabilities in its own methods (e.g., custom setters, `init` methods, KVC handling).  Thorough code review and testing of model classes are essential.
*   **Complex Interactions:**  The interaction between `YYModel` and other parts of the application can create unexpected vulnerabilities.  For example, if the application uses the deserialized objects in a way that's not anticipated, it could lead to problems.
*   **Implementation Errors:**  Mistakes in implementing the mitigation strategies (e.g., an incomplete whitelist, incorrect validation logic) can leave the application vulnerable.

### 2.4 Concrete Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Whitelisting:**  Implement `modelSetClassWhitelist` *immediately* and ensure it's comprehensive and regularly reviewed. This is the single most important step.
2.  **Implement JSON Schema Validation:**  Use a JSON Schema validator *before* calling `YYModel` to enforce a strict schema on the incoming JSON data.
3.  **Post-Deserialization Validation:**  Add thorough validation checks *after* deserialization to ensure the data in the model objects is valid and safe.
4.  **Limit Input Size:**  Set a reasonable limit on the size of the JSON data accepted by the application.
5.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews of both the model classes and the code that uses `YYModel`.
6.  **Stay Updated:**  Keep YYKit updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches.
7.  **Consider Alternatives (If High Security is Required):**  For applications with extremely high security requirements, consider using a more restrictive deserialization approach, such as manual parsing or a library specifically designed for secure deserialization (though such libraries might be less convenient).
8.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):** Implement a fuzzing strategy. Create a fuzzer that generates a wide variety of malformed and valid JSON inputs, and feed these inputs to your application, monitoring for crashes, exceptions, or unexpected behavior. This can help uncover edge cases and vulnerabilities that are difficult to find through static analysis.
9. **Runtime Monitoring:** Consider using runtime security monitoring tools that can detect and potentially block malicious activity related to deserialization.

### 2.5 Conclusion
Deserialization of untrusted data is a critical attack surface. While YYModel provides convenient functionality, it introduces significant security risks if not used carefully. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly mandatory class whitelisting and strict input validation, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. However, ongoing vigilance, regular security reviews, and staying informed about potential vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining a secure application. The residual risks highlight the importance of a defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple layers of security to protect against potential attacks.
