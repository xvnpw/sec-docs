# Attack Surface Analysis for ibireme/yykit

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data (YYModel)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data__yymodel_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers craft malicious JSON or other data formats that, when deserialized by `YYModel`, exploit vulnerabilities to achieve unexpected code execution, data leaks, or denial of service.
*   **YYKit Contribution:**  `YYModel` provides the core deserialization functionality, making it the direct entry point for this attack.  Its reliance on reflection and key-value coding increases the potential for vulnerabilities if not used carefully.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload containing a class name that is not whitelisted but has a vulnerable `init` method or a method that conforms to a protocol expected by the application.  When `YYModel` attempts to create an instance of this class, the vulnerable code is executed.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Breach, Application Crash, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Class Whitelisting:**  *Always* use `modelSetClassWhitelist` to explicitly define the *only* allowed classes for deserialization.  This is the *primary* defense.  Do *not* rely on blacklisting alone.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate all data *before* and *after* deserialization.  Use a schema validation library (e.g., JSON Schema) if possible.  Check for expected data types, ranges, and lengths.
    *   **Limit Data Size:**  Restrict the size of the input data to prevent excessive memory consumption.
    *   **Avoid Deserializing Complex, Nested Structures from Untrusted Sources:** If possible, simplify the data format or use a more secure parsing method for untrusted data.

## Attack Surface: [Image Decoding Exploits (YYImage/YYWebImage)](./attack_surfaces/image_decoding_exploits__yyimageyywebimage_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers provide maliciously crafted image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.) that exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding libraries (ImageIO, etc.) used by `YYImage` and `YYWebImage`.
*   **YYKit Contribution:**  `YYImage` and `YYWebImage` handle image loading, decoding, and caching, making them the pathway for these exploits.  While the vulnerabilities are in the system frameworks, YYKit facilitates their exploitation.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG file to a profile picture feature.  This PNG contains malformed data that triggers a buffer overflow in the ImageIO framework when `YYImage` attempts to decode it, leading to code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Application Crash, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep iOS Updated:**  This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  Image decoding vulnerabilities are frequently patched in iOS updates.  Ensure users are running supported iOS versions.
    *   **Limit Image Dimensions and Size:**  Enforce strict limits on the maximum width, height, and file size of images processed by the application.  This mitigates denial-of-service attacks and can reduce the likelihood of triggering certain vulnerabilities.
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Image Sources:** If possible, restrict image downloads to trusted sources (e.g., your own servers).
    *   **Server-Side Image Processing (If Feasible):**  Consider performing image resizing and validation on a trusted server *before* sending the image to the client. This reduces the attack surface on the client device.
