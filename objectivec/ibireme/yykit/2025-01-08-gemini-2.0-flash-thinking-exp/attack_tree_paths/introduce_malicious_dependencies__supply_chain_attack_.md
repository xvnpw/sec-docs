        **Conclusion:**

        The "Introduce Malicious Dependencies" attack path represents a significant and often overlooked threat.
        It highlights the importance of a robust security strategy that extends beyond the application's own codebase
        to encompass the entire supply chain. Development teams using YYKit must be vigilant in managing their
        dependencies, implementing preventative measures, and staying informed about potential threats.
        A proactive and layered approach to security is crucial to mitigate the risks associated with this attack
        vector and ensure the integrity and security of their applications and user data. This requires a shared
        responsibility between the application development team and the maintainers of the libraries they depend on.
