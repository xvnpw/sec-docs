# Threat Model Analysis for ibireme/yykit

## Threat: [Image Decoding Vulnerability Leading to Code Execution](./threats/image_decoding_vulnerability_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF) that exploits a vulnerability in the image decoding libraries used *directly by `YYKit`* (or its tightly integrated components). Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's device.

**Impact:** Critical - Allows the attacker to gain complete control over the user's device, potentially stealing data, installing malware, or performing other malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** `YYKit/YYImage (YYAnimatedImageView, YYWebImage)` - specifically the image decoding and rendering parts implemented within `YYKit`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure `YYKit` is always updated to the latest version with security patches that address image decoding vulnerabilities.
* Implement server-side validation and sanitization of uploaded images before they are processed by the application and `YYKit`.
* Consider using additional security measures for image processing if `YYKit` relies on system libraries that are known to have past vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted String Causing Crash](./threats/maliciously_crafted_string_causing_crash.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted string as input to a `YYKit` component (like `YYLabel` or `YYTextView`). This string exploits a parsing vulnerability or buffer overflow *within the component's own rendering logic in `YYKit`*, leading to an application crash.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes unusable. Repeated crashes can frustrate users and damage the application's reputation.

**Affected Component:** `YYKit/YYText (YYLabel, YYTextView, YYTextLayout)` - specifically the text rendering and layout engine implemented within `YYKit`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided text before passing it to `YYKit` components.
* Keep `YYKit` updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for parsing vulnerabilities in its text handling.
* Consider setting limits on the length of text input to prevent potential buffer overflows within `YYKit`'s components.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability in Logging or Error Handling (If Present)](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_in_logging_or_error_handling__if_present_.md)

**Description:** If `YYKit` internally uses format strings for logging or error messages and incorporates user-provided data without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`) to read from arbitrary memory locations or potentially write to them, leading to information disclosure or code execution *within the context of the `YYKit` library or the application using it*.

**Impact:** High to Critical - Could lead to information disclosure (reading sensitive data from memory) or arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Potentially any component within `YYKit` that performs logging or error reporting if it uses unsafe format string handling *within its own codebase*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that `YYKit` does not use user-provided data directly in format strings for logging or error messages. Ideally, logging should use static strings or parameterized logging.
* Regularly review the `YYKit` source code (if possible) for potential format string vulnerabilities.
