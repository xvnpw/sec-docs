Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving YYText with High or Critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Maliciously Crafted Attributed Strings**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities by providing specially crafted `NSAttributedString` objects that cause unexpected behavior during rendering or processing.
    *   **How YYText Contributes:** YYText is responsible for rendering and laying out attributed strings. If these strings, potentially from external sources or user input, contain excessive or unusual attributes, YYText's processing can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides an attributed string with thousands of nested `NSForegroundColorAttributeName` attributes, leading to excessive processing and potentially freezing the UI or crashing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application freeze or crash), potential for memory exhaustion, and in some cases, unexpected visual rendering or behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize attributed strings before rendering.
        *   Limit the number and complexity of attributes allowed in user-provided content.
        *   Implement timeouts or resource limits for text rendering operations.
        *   Consider using a more restrictive subset of attributes if full flexibility is not required.

*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML Rendering**
    *   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into content rendered by YYText when using its HTML parsing capabilities.
    *   **How YYText Contributes:** YYText can render HTML content. If this HTML is not properly sanitized before being processed by YYText, it can execute embedded JavaScript.
    *   **Example:** A user provides HTML content containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which, when rendered by YYText, executes the JavaScript in the application's context.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly avoid rendering untrusted HTML content with YYText if possible.**
        *   If HTML rendering is necessary, use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., `HTMLPurifier` or similar for Objective-C/Swift) *before* passing the HTML to YYText.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious URLs in Links**
    *   **Description:** Embedding malicious URLs within text rendered by YYText, potentially leading users to phishing sites or other harmful content.
    *   **How YYText Contributes:** YYText renders links defined in attributed strings or HTML. If these links are not validated, users can be tricked into clicking on malicious URLs.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides text containing a link that appears legitimate but redirects to a phishing website when clicked.
    *   **Impact:**  Users being redirected to malicious websites, potential for credential theft or malware installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize URLs before rendering them with YYText.
        *   Implement visual cues to indicate that a link is external or potentially untrusted.
        *   Consider using a URL rewriting mechanism to inspect and potentially block malicious URLs before redirection.
