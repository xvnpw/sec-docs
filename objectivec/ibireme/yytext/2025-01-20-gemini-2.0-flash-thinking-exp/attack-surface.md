## Attack Surface: [High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving YYText](./attack_surfaces/high_and_critical_attack_surfaces_directly_involving_yytext.md)



## Attack Surface: [Malicious Rich Text Attributes:](./attack_surfaces/malicious_rich_text_attributes.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject specially crafted or malicious data within rich text attributes (both standard and custom) processed by YYText.
    * **How YYText Contributes:** YYText parses and renders text with various attributes. If the application doesn't sanitize or validate these attributes, YYText will process them, potentially leading to exploitation. The ability to define custom attributes in YYText further expands this attack surface.
    * **Example:** Injecting a custom attribute like `data-evil-url="https://attacker.com/steal-data"` which is later processed by application logic without sanitization, leading to an unintended request.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), data exfiltration, or other application-specific vulnerabilities depending on how the attributes are handled post-rendering.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all rich text attributes before processing them with YYText. Use a whitelist approach for allowed attributes and their values. Escape or encode attribute values appropriately based on their intended use. Avoid directly using custom attribute values in security-sensitive operations without thorough validation.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Rich Text Formatting:](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_rich_text_formatting.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can embed malicious scripts within the rich text formatting that, when rendered by YYText in a web view or similar context, execute in the user's browser.
    * **How YYText Contributes:** YYText renders rich text, including elements like links and potentially custom formatting, which can be vectors for injecting JavaScript if not handled carefully by the application.
    * **Example:** Embedding a hyperlink with a `javascript:` URL (e.g., `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click Me</a>`) that, when rendered by YYText in a web view, executes the JavaScript.
    * **Impact:**  Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, defacement.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** When rendering YYText content in web views, ensure proper Content Security Policy (CSP) is in place to restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially harmful content. Sanitize or escape the output of YYText before rendering it in a web context. Avoid directly rendering user-provided rich text without careful processing. Consider using a safe subset of HTML or a dedicated rich text rendering component with built-in XSS protection.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Interactive Features (e.g., `YYTextHighlight`):](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_interactive_features__e_g____yytexthighlight__.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses interactive features provided by YYText (like `YYTextHighlight` for links or mentions), attackers can manipulate these features to trigger unintended actions or access sensitive information.
    * **How YYText Contributes:** YYText provides mechanisms for making parts of the text interactive. If the actions associated with these interactions are not properly secured, they can be exploited.
    * **Example:** Creating a `YYTextHighlight` that, when tapped, triggers a function that performs a privileged operation without proper authorization checks.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, privilege escalation, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust authorization checks for any actions triggered by interactive elements within YYText. Carefully validate and sanitize any data passed to these actions. Avoid directly exposing sensitive functionalities through interactive text elements without proper security measures.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Safety Issues (Less Likely with ARC, but Possible in Underlying C/C++):](./attack_surfaces/memory_safety_issues__less_likely_with_arc__but_possible_in_underlying_cc++_.md)

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or memory corruption could theoretically exist in the underlying C/C++ code used by YYText for text layout and rendering, especially when handling extremely large or malformed input.
    * **How YYText Contributes:** YYText relies on lower-level code for core functionalities. If this code has memory safety issues, processing malicious input through YYText could trigger them.
    * **Example:** Providing an extremely long string that overflows a fixed-size buffer in the underlying rendering engine.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Keep YYText updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. While direct mitigation is limited, robust testing with large and malformed inputs can help identify potential issues. Employ memory safety analysis tools during development.
