# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a high-performance and feature-rich text rendering and manipulation framework for iOS and macOS developers.
  - Enable developers to create visually appealing and interactive text-based user interfaces in their applications.
  - Offer a flexible and extensible library that can be adapted to various text layout and rendering needs.
  - Improve developer productivity by providing a well-documented and easy-to-use API.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Risk of vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using yytext, leading to security breaches or application instability.
  - Risk of performance issues or bugs in the library that could negatively impact the user experience of applications using yytext.
  - Risk of compatibility issues with different iOS and macOS versions or devices, potentially limiting the library's adoption and usability.
  - Risk of insufficient documentation or developer support, hindering adoption and increasing development costs for users.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Reliance on operating system level security features provided by iOS and macOS. Implemented by: Operating System.
  - security control: Code review process during development. Implemented by: Development Team (assumed).
  - security control: Publicly available source code on GitHub for community review. Implemented by: Open Source Nature.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities inherent in open-source software components.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security patches and updates.
  - accepted risk: Risk of supply chain attacks if dependencies are compromised (though yytext seems to have minimal external dependencies).

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated static code analysis (SAST) in the development pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Regularly update and scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Consider fuzz testing to identify potential input validation issues and unexpected behavior.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a text rendering library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use yytext.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a text rendering library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use yytext.
  - Input Validation:
    - The library must handle various text inputs robustly and prevent crashes or unexpected behavior due to malformed or malicious input.
    - Input validation should be performed on all external data processed by the library, including text strings, formatting parameters, and resource paths.
  - Cryptography:
    - If yytext is intended to handle or process sensitive text data (e.g., passwords, API keys), ensure that appropriate cryptographic measures are used by the applications using the library, not within the library itself as it's a rendering component. If the library itself needs to handle any encryption keys or sensitive data internally (which is unlikely for a text rendering library), specific cryptographic requirements would need to be defined. For now, assume cryptography is not a core requirement for yytext library itself, but for applications using it if they process sensitive text.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and maintenance of the yytext library.
  - Integration of yytext library into iOS/macOS applications.
  - Distribution of applications using yytext to end-users.
  - User experience of applications relying on yytext for text rendering.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of yytext library: High sensitivity - Confidentiality and Integrity are critical to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of intellectual property and potential vulnerabilities.
  - Build artifacts (framework/library): Medium sensitivity - Integrity is critical to ensure that distributed library is not tampered with and is safe to use.
  - Developer credentials and secrets used in build process: High sensitivity - Confidentiality is critical to prevent unauthorized access to build systems and code repositories.
  - Text data processed by applications using yytext: Sensitivity depends on the application context. Could range from low (display text) to high (sensitive user data displayed in text format). Applications are responsible for protecting the sensitivity of their data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in yytext?
  - Are there any specific security certifications or compliance requirements for yytext or applications using it?
  - What is the intended audience and use cases for yytext? Are there specific industries or applications with heightened security concerns?
  - Are there any automated tests (unit, integration, UI) in place for yytext, and are security tests included in these?
  - What are the external dependencies of yytext, and how are they managed and updated?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a useful and performant text rendering library for developers. Security is important for the library's reputation and user trust, but not the absolute top priority compared to functionality and performance in the initial stages.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Currently, security relies on general good coding practices and open-source community review. There are no explicitly stated security controls or processes beyond standard development practices. Applications using yytext are responsible for their own application-level security.
  - DESIGN: yytext is designed as a library to be integrated into applications. It does not operate as a standalone service or application. Deployment is through integration into application build processes and distribution via application stores. Build process is likely standard for iOS/macOS development, potentially with some level of CI automation.
