# Threat Model Analysis for ibireme/yytext

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Text Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_text_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious text input exceeding expected buffer sizes during parsing or layout calculations within `yytext`. This involves sending extremely long strings or text with specific formatting that triggers buffer overflows in `yytext`'s C/Objective-C code. The attacker aims to overwrite adjacent memory regions.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the attacker can control the overflowed data to inject and execute malicious code.

**Affected yytext component:** Core text parsing and layout modules (internal C/Objective-C implementation).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization before passing text to `yytext`. Limit input string length and complexity.
*   **Fuzz Testing:** Conduct thorough fuzz testing of `yytext` with a wide range of inputs, including very long strings and edge cases, to identify potential buffer overflows.
*   **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools to scan `yytext` source code for potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   **Memory Sanitizers:** Employ AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing to detect memory errors, including buffer overflows, early.
*   **Code Review:** Perform detailed code reviews of `yytext` source code, focusing on buffer handling and string manipulation functions.
*   **Library Updates:** Keep `yytext` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches addressing buffer overflow issues.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Vulnerability](./threats/use-after-free_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker triggers a scenario where `yytext` attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated. This could be achieved by manipulating object lifecycles or data structures within `yytext` through specific API calls or input sequences. The attacker aims to exploit the use of freed memory for malicious purposes.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the attacker can manipulate the freed memory region to inject and execute code.

**Affected yytext component:** Memory management routines within `yytext`'s object handling and data structures (internal implementation).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of `yytext` source code, focusing on object lifecycle management and memory allocation/deallocation patterns.
*   **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential use-after-free vulnerabilities in `yytext`.
*   **Memory Sanitizers:** Employ AddressSanitizer (ASan) during development and testing to detect use-after-free errors.
*   **Modern Memory Management:** Ensure `yytext` utilizes modern Objective-C memory management practices (ARC where applicable and used correctly) to minimize manual memory management errors.
*   **Library Updates:** Keep `yytext` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and memory management improvements addressing use-after-free issues.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Text Input](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_text_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, excessively complex text input to the application using `yytext`. This input is designed to consume excessive CPU or memory resources during processing by `yytext`, leading to performance degradation or application unresponsiveness. The attacker aims to exhaust application resources and make it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Application becomes slow, unresponsive, or crashes, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.

**Affected yytext component:** Text processing and layout algorithms within `yytext` (specifically those handling complex text structures or resource-intensive operations).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation and Limits:** Implement input validation and sanitization to limit the size and complexity of text input processed by `yytext`. Set maximum string lengths and complexity thresholds.
*   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits within the application to constrain the resources consumed by `yytext` operations (e.g., CPU time limits, memory usage limits).
*   **Rate Limiting/Throttling:** If text input originates from external sources, implement rate limiting or throttling to prevent excessive requests that could lead to DoS.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor application performance and resource usage when processing text with `yytext` to identify potential DoS vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.
*   **Optimize Text Processing:** Investigate and optimize `yytext` usage and application code to improve text processing efficiency and reduce resource consumption.
