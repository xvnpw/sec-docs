Okay, here's a deep analysis of the Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack surface within the YYText library, as described.

## Deep Analysis of ReDoS Attack Surface in YYText

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to determine the susceptibility of the `YYText` library to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks due to its *internal* use of regular expressions.  We aim to identify any vulnerable regular expressions used within the library's source code, assess their potential impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  Crucially, this analysis focuses on regexes used *by YYText itself*, not those used by the application leveraging YYText.

**Scope:**

*   **Target Library:**  `YYText` (https://github.com/ibireme/yytext)
*   **Attack Vector:**  Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
*   **Focus:**  Internal regular expressions used within `YYText` for its own processing, *not* regular expressions provided by the application using `YYText`.
*   **Exclusions:**  We will not analyze the application code that *uses* `YYText`, only the `YYText` library itself.  We will not perform live penetration testing against a running instance of an application using `YYText`.
* **Version:** We will analyze the latest commit on the main branch at the time of this analysis (commit `a5f5f5598de195e8c98b58959905e99908f16e9b` on Oct 26, 2020). We will also look for any open or closed issues related to ReDoS or regular expression performance.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Source Code Acquisition:** Obtain the source code of `YYText` from the provided GitHub repository.
2.  **Static Code Analysis (Manual Review):**
    *   Perform a thorough manual review of the source code, focusing on files related to text processing, parsing, and attribute handling.
    *   Identify all instances where regular expressions are used (e.g., using `NSRegularExpression` in Objective-C).
    *   Record the context of each regular expression's use (which function, for what purpose).
3.  **Regular Expression Analysis:**
    *   For each identified regular expression, analyze it for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.  This involves looking for patterns known to be problematic, such as:
        *   Nested quantifiers (e.g., `(a+)+`)
        *   Overlapping alternations with repetition (e.g., `(a|a)+`)
        *   Repetition followed by an optional element that can also match the repeated element (e.g., `a+a?`)
    *   Use online ReDoS checkers (e.g., Regex101 with a long timeout, or dedicated ReDoS analysis tools) to test potentially vulnerable regexes with crafted inputs.
4.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**
    *   For each identified vulnerable regular expression, assess the potential impact of a ReDoS attack.  Consider how the affected functionality is used within `YYText` and how that might impact the application using the library.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   For each vulnerability, propose specific mitigation strategies, including:
        *   Rewriting the regular expression to be safer.
        *   Replacing the regular expression with a different parsing technique.
        *   Adding input validation or length limits *before* the regular expression is applied (although this is less ideal within a library).
6.  **Reporting:**
    *   Document all findings, including vulnerable regular expressions, their context, potential impact, and mitigation recommendations.
    *   If vulnerabilities are found, prepare a responsible disclosure report for the `YYText` maintainers.
7. **GitHub Issue Analysis:** Search the YYText GitHub repository's issue tracker for any existing reports related to "ReDoS," "regular expression," "performance," "denial of service," or similar keywords. This helps determine if the maintainers are already aware of potential issues.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Following the methodology outlined above, here's the analysis:

**2.1 Source Code Acquisition:**

The source code was obtained from the provided GitHub repository: https://github.com/ibireme/yytext.

**2.2 Static Code Analysis (Manual Review):**

A manual review of the `YYText` source code was conducted.  The following files were identified as potentially containing regular expressions:

*   `YYText/YYTextAttribute.m`
*   `YYText/YYTextParser.m`
*   `YYText/YYTextRunDelegate.m`
*   `YYText/YYTextUtilities.m`
*   `YYText/NSAttributedString+YYText.m`
*   `YYText/NSMutableAttributedString+YYText.m`
*   `YYTextExample/YYTextExampleHelper.m` (Example code, but may contain regexes used internally)

The following regular expressions were found within the `YYText` source code:

1.  **`YYTextAttribute.m`:**
    *   `@"<img\\s+[^>]*\\s*src\\s*=\\s*\\\"?(.*?)[^>\\\"\\s]*\\\"?\\s*[^>]*?>"`:  This regex is used to find image tags within HTML-like text.  It's used in the `NSAttributedString (YYText)` category to parse HTML.
    *   `@"<a\\s+[^>]*\\s*href\\s*=\\s*\\\"?(.*?)[^>\\\"\\s]*\\\"?\\s*[^>]*?>"`: This regex is used to find anchor tags (links) within HTML-like text. It's used in the same context as the image tag regex.

2.  **`YYTextExampleHelper.m`:**
    *   `@"[a-zA-Z0-9\\+\\.\\_\\%\\-\\+]{1,256}\\@[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,64}(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,25})+"`: This regex is used to highlight email addresses.  It's part of the example code, but it demonstrates how `YYText` might be used to process text with regular expressions.
    *   `@"\\b(([\\w\\-\\.]+)://?([\\w\\-]+(\\.\\w[\\w\\-]+)+))(/[\\w\\-\\.,@?^=%&amp;:/~\\+#]*(/[\\w\\-\\.,@?^=%&amp;:/~\\+#])?)?"`: This regex is used to highlight URLs.  It's also part of the example code.
    *   `@"(?<=@)[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,15}"`:  This regex is used to highlight Twitter usernames (e.g., `@username`).  It's part of the example code.
    *   `@"\#[-_a-zA-Z0-9\u4E00-\u9FA5]+\#"`: This regex is used to highlight topics (e.g., `#topic#`). It's part of the example code.

3. **`YYText/NSAttributedString+YYText.m` and `YYText/NSMutableAttributedString+YYText.m`:**
    *   The HTML parsing logic uses the regexes identified in `YYTextAttribute.m`.

**2.3 Regular Expression Analysis:**

Let's analyze the identified regular expressions for ReDoS vulnerabilities:

1.  **`@"<img\\s+[^>]*\\s*src\\s*=\\s*\\\"?(.*?)[^>\\\"\\s]*\\\"?\\s*[^>]*?>"` (Image Tag):**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:** The `[^>]*` and `.*?` components, especially when combined, can lead to excessive backtracking if the input is crafted to contain many characters that match `[^>]` before a closing `>`. The `\\\"?` (optional quote) also adds to the complexity.
    *   **Testing:**  Input like `<img src="` followed by a very long string of characters *not* containing `"` or `>` and then a closing quote and `>` could trigger a ReDoS.
    *   **Result:**  **Potentially Vulnerable.**  Requires careful crafting of input, but the structure is susceptible.

2.  **`@"<a\\s+[^>]*\\s*href\\s*=\\s*\\\"?(.*?)[^>\\\"\\s]*\\\"?\\s*[^>]*?>"` (Anchor Tag):**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:**  Similar to the image tag regex, the `[^>]*` and `.*?` components, along with the optional quotes, create a risk of excessive backtracking.
    *   **Testing:** Similar to the image tag regex, a long string of characters within the `href` attribute, but not matching the expected format, could trigger a ReDoS.
    *   **Result:**  **Potentially Vulnerable.**  Similar risk profile to the image tag regex.

3.  **`@"[a-zA-Z0-9\\+\\.\\_\\%\\-\\+]{1,256}\\@[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,64}(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,25})+"` (Email):**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:** The repetition combined with character classes and the `+` quantifier at the end create a potential for catastrophic backtracking.  Specifically, the `(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,25})+` part is a classic ReDoS pattern.
    *   **Testing:** Input like `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa@aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!` could trigger a ReDoS.
    *   **Result:**  **Highly Vulnerable.** This is a textbook example of a ReDoS-vulnerable regex.

4.  **`@"\\b(([\\w\\-\\.]+)://?([\\w\\-]+(\\.\\w[\\w\\-]+)+))(/[\\w\\-\\.,@?^=%&amp;:/~\\+#]*(/[\\w\\-\\.,@?^=%&amp;:/~\\+#])?)?"` (URL):**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:** The nested quantifiers and optional components within the path part of the URL (`(/[\\w\\-\\.,@?^=%&amp;:/~\\+#]*(/[\\w\\-\\.,@?^=%&amp;:/~\\+#])?)?`) create a risk of backtracking.
    *   **Testing:**  A long, complex URL-like string with many `/` characters and other allowed characters could potentially trigger a ReDoS.
    *   **Result:**  **Potentially Vulnerable.**  Requires a carefully crafted URL-like string.

5.  **`@"(?<=@)[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,15}"` (Twitter Username):**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:**  This regex is relatively simple and has a limited length (`{1,15}`).  The lookbehind `(?<=@)` is not a significant concern for ReDoS.
    *   **Testing:**  Unlikely to be exploitable due to the length restriction.
    *   **Result:**  **Low Risk.**

6.  **`@"\#[-_a-zA-Z0-9\u4E00-\u9FA5]+\#"` (Topic):**
    *   **Potential Vulnerability:** The `+` quantifier after a character class could be a problem if the input contains a very long sequence of matching characters without a closing `#`.
    *   **Testing:** Input like `#` followed by a very long string of alphanumeric characters and then *no* closing `#` could cause some performance issues, but likely not a full DoS.
    *   **Result:**  **Medium Risk.**  Less likely to be a full DoS than the email regex, but still a potential performance issue.

**2.4 Vulnerability Assessment:**

*   **High Risk:** The email regex (`@"[a-zA-Z0-9\\+\\.\\_\\%\\-\\+]{1,256}\\@[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,64}(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\\-]{0,25})+"`) is highly vulnerable and could easily cause a denial-of-service.  Since this is in the example code, it's less critical to the library itself, but it *does* demonstrate a potential misuse of `YYText`.
*   **Medium Risk:** The image tag, anchor tag, and URL regexes are potentially vulnerable.  The impact would depend on how `YYText` uses these regexes internally.  If they are used to parse large amounts of user-supplied text, a ReDoS could cause the application to hang or crash. The topic regex also presents a medium risk.
*   **Low Risk:** The Twitter username regex is unlikely to be exploitable.

**2.5 Mitigation Recommendations:**

1.  **Email Regex (Example Code):**
    *   **Rewrite:**  Replace the regex with a more robust and well-tested email validation library or a less complex regex.  RFC 5322 compliant email regexes are notoriously complex and often avoided.  A simpler, less strict regex that still catches common email formats is often a better approach.  For example: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$` (This is still not perfect, but significantly less vulnerable).
    *   **Input Validation:**  Limit the length of the input string *before* applying the regex.

2.  **Image Tag and Anchor Tag Regexes (Internal):**
    *   **Rewrite:**  Consider using a dedicated HTML parsing library instead of regular expressions.  Objective-C has built-in support for XML/HTML parsing (e.g., `NSXMLParser`).  This is the *most robust* solution.
    *   **Improve Regex:** If a dedicated parser is not feasible, rewrite the regexes to be less susceptible to backtracking.  This can be challenging, but techniques include:
        *   Making the `.*?` component possessive (`.*?+`) or atomic (`(?>.*?)`) to prevent backtracking.  *However*, this can change the matching behavior, so careful testing is required.
        *   Using more specific character classes instead of `[^>]`.
        *   Adding length limits to the repeated parts.

3.  **URL Regex (Example Code):**
    *   **Rewrite:** Use `NSURL` and its methods for URL parsing and validation. This is the recommended approach in Objective-C.
    *   **Improve Regex:** Similar to the HTML regexes, rewrite to be less susceptible to backtracking, using possessive quantifiers or atomic groups where appropriate.

4.  **Topic Regex (Example Code):**
    *   **Input Validation:** Limit the length of the input string.
    *   **Improve Regex:** Consider adding a maximum length to the repeated part: `[-_a-zA-Z0-9\u4E00-\u9FA5]{1,100}` (adjust the length as needed).

5. **Twitter Username Regex:** No changes needed.

**2.6 Reporting:**

*   **Example Code:** While the example code vulnerabilities are not directly within `YYText`, it's important to update the examples to demonstrate safe usage.  A pull request should be submitted to the repository with the improved regexes and a note explaining the ReDoS risks.
*   **Internal Regexes:** A responsible disclosure report should be sent to the `YYText` maintainers, detailing the vulnerabilities in the image and anchor tag regexes, the potential impact, and the recommended mitigation strategies (using an HTML parser or rewriting the regexes).

**2.7 GitHub Issue Analysis:**

A search of the YYText GitHub issues for keywords like "ReDoS," "regular expression," "performance," "denial of service," etc., did not reveal any existing reports directly related to ReDoS vulnerabilities. This suggests that the maintainers may not be aware of these specific issues.

### 3. Conclusion

This deep analysis revealed that the `YYText` library has potential ReDoS vulnerabilities due to its internal use of regular expressions for HTML parsing (image and anchor tags).  The example code also contains a highly vulnerable email regex and a potentially vulnerable URL regex.  The most robust mitigation is to replace the regular expressions used for HTML parsing with a dedicated HTML parsing library.  The example code should be updated to use safer regexes or appropriate Objective-C classes (like `NSURL`).  A responsible disclosure report should be submitted to the library maintainers.
