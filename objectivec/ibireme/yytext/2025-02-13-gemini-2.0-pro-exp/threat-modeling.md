# Threat Model Analysis for ibireme/yytext

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in `YYTextParser`](./threats/buffer_overflow_in__yytextparser_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed rich text string with excessively long attributes, values, or text segments.  This input is designed to overflow buffers within the `YYTextParser` component during the parsing process, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution. The attacker might use malformed nested attributes or extremely long strings within a single attribute.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS) through application crash.  Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the overflow can be controlled to overwrite critical memory regions.
*   **Affected Component:** `YYTextParser` (specifically, functions related to parsing attributes, text segments, and nested structures).  This includes functions like those handling string copying, length calculations, and memory allocation within the parser.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement strict length limits and character restrictions *before* passing any data to `YYTextParser`.  Validate the structure of the input to ensure it conforms to expected formats.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Perform extensive fuzz testing of `YYTextParser` with a wide range of malformed and oversized inputs.
    *   **Memory Safety:** Compile YYText with memory safety features (e.g., AddressSanitizer) to detect and prevent buffer overflows.
    *   **Code Review:**  Manually review the `YYTextParser` code for potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities, paying close attention to string handling and memory allocation.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Recursive Layout in `YYTextLayout`](./threats/denial_of_service_via_recursive_layout_in__yytextlayout_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input with deeply nested or cyclical layout constraints (e.g., attachments referencing other attachments in a loop, or excessively nested text containers). This forces `YYTextLayout` to perform excessive calculations, potentially leading to a stack overflow or excessive CPU consumption, causing the application to become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to application unresponsiveness or crash.
*   **Affected Component:** `YYTextLayout` (specifically, functions related to calculating layout, resolving constraints, and handling nested elements). This includes functions that recursively traverse the layout tree.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Depth Limiting:**  Impose a strict limit on the nesting depth of layout elements (attachments, containers, etc.) *before* passing data to `YYTextLayout`.
    *   **Cycle Detection:** Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent cyclical layout dependencies.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Set resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory usage) for the layout process to prevent it from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Asynchronous Layout:** Perform layout calculations in a background thread to prevent blocking the main thread and maintain application responsiveness.

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization in `NSCoding` Implementation (if used)](./threats/unsafe_deserialization_in__nscoding__implementation__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If YYText uses `NSCoding` for serialization and deserialization of its data structures, and if an attacker can control the serialized data, they might be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the `NSCoding` implementation (or custom class implementations) to achieve arbitrary code execution. This is a common vulnerability pattern with object serialization. The attacker could provide a crafted serialized object that, when deserialized by YYText, triggers the execution of malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Affected Component:** Any YYText classes that implement `NSCoding` (e.g., `YYTextLayout`, `YYTextAttachment`, custom subclasses).  Specifically, the `initWithCoder:` methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `NSCoding` if Possible:** If possible, avoid using `NSCoding` for untrusted data. Consider using a more secure serialization format like JSON or Protocol Buffers with strict schema validation.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** If `NSCoding` *must* be used, follow secure coding practices for `NSCoding`. Use `NSSecureCoding` and validate the class type of *each* object during deserialization *within the `initWithCoder:` method*.  Do not assume the type of any object being deserialized.
    *   **Input Validation:**  *Never* deserialize data from untrusted sources directly.  Validate and sanitize the serialized data *before* attempting to deserialize it. This validation should check for structural integrity and expected data types.

## Threat: [Improper handling of URL schemes in `YYTextView`](./threats/improper_handling_of_url_schemes_in__yytextview_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a rich text string containing malicious URLs with custom or unexpected URL schemes. When a user interacts with these URLs (e.g., taps on them), the application, through `YYTextView`'s handling, might be tricked into executing unintended actions or opening malicious applications. This relies on `YYTextView`'s URL handling logic and its interaction with the system's URL scheme handling.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially leading to phishing attacks, launching of malicious applications, or execution of arbitrary code if a custom URL scheme handler (that `YYTextView` invokes) is vulnerable.
    * **Affected Component:** `YYTextView` (specifically, the handling of URL interactions and delegate methods related to URL opening, such as `textView:shouldInteractWithURL:inRange:interaction:`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **URL Scheme Whitelisting:**  Implement a strict whitelist of allowed URL schemes *within the `YYTextViewDelegate`*.  Only allow known-safe schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`, `mailto`).  Block or sanitize any URLs with unrecognized or potentially dangerous schemes.
        *   **Delegate Validation:**  If using `YYTextViewDelegate` methods to handle URL interactions, carefully validate the URL *before* taking any action.  Do not blindly open URLs without checking their safety and scheme. This validation should occur *within the delegate method*.
        *   **User Confirmation:**  Prompt the user for confirmation before opening any URL, especially if it uses a non-standard scheme. This provides an additional layer of defense even if validation fails.
        * **Sandboxing (if applicable):** If custom URL scheme handling is necessary, and those schemes are handled by other parts of the application, consider performing the handling within a sandboxed environment to limit the potential impact of exploits. This is less directly related to YYText itself, but relevant to the overall threat.
