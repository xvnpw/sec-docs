# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ibireme/yytext

## Mitigation Strategy: [Attribute Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/attribute_whitelisting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Attributes:**  Create a list of `YYText` attributes (font, `NSAttributedString.Key`, color, size, links, attachments, custom attributes, etc.) that are essential.
    2.  **Create a Whitelist:** Define a data structure (e.g., a `Set<NSAttributedString.Key>` or an `enum` in Swift) containing *only* the allowed attribute keys.
    3.  **Validation Function:** Implement a function that takes a `YYText` object, `NSMutableAttributedString`, or `NSAttributedString` as input. This function should:
        *   Use `enumerateAttributes(in:options:using:)` to iterate through all attributes.
        *   For each attribute, check if its `NSAttributedString.Key` is in the whitelist.
        *   If *not* in the whitelist, remove the attribute using `removeAttribute(_:range:)` on a mutable copy.
        *   If in the whitelist, perform additional value validation (e.g., URL format for link attributes using `YYTextUtilities` or custom logic).
    4.  **Integrate Validation:** Call this function *before* setting any user-supplied content to a `YYTextView`, `YYLabel`, or any other `YYText` component.  This is crucial: validate *before* the potentially malicious content is processed by `YYText`.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the whitelist.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents injection of malicious attributes (e.g., those with JavaScript in a `javascript:` URL within a link).
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Restricting attributes can prevent embedding hidden data.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Limiting complex attributes can help prevent DoS.
    *   **Phishing (Severity: High):** Controlling link attributes reduces phishing risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:**  Significantly reduces risk (80-90%).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Moderate reduction (50-70%).
    *   **DoS:**  Minor to moderate reduction (20-40%).
    *   **Phishing:** Significant reduction (70-80%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `TextEditorViewController` has a basic whitelist for font styles, but it's incomplete and lacks value validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `ChatViewController`: No attribute whitelisting.
    *   `ProfileViewController`: No whitelisting.
    *   Network data parsing: No validation before creating `YYText` objects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Attachment Handling (Strict, YYText-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/attachment_handling__strict__yytext-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Attachments (If Possible):** If not essential, disable `YYText` attachment support entirely. This is the most secure approach.  This often involves *not* using `YYText` features that inherently support attachments.
    2.  **Type Validation (Magic Numbers):** If attachments are required, and you are using `YYText`'s attachment handling:
        *   Create a whitelist of allowed MIME types.
        *   Before creating a `YYTextAttachment` (or equivalent), read the *first few bytes* of the attachment data.
        *   Compare the magic number against a known list for the allowed MIME types. *Do not rely on file extensions.*
        *   *Only* create the `YYTextAttachment` if the magic number matches.  Reject the attachment otherwise.
    3.  **Size Limits:** Before creating a `YYTextAttachment`, check the size of the attachment data. Enforce a maximum size *before* processing.
    4.  **Content Scanning (Pre-Attachment Creation):**
        *   Integrate with a malware scanning service.
        *   Send the attachment data to the service *before* creating a `YYTextAttachment`.
        *   *Only* create the `YYTextAttachment` if the scan is clean.
    5. **Sandboxing (If using YYText's display):** If using YYText to *display* attachments, and you cannot use a separate sandboxed view, be *extremely* cautious. Consider:
        * Limiting the types of attachments that YYText will render directly.
        * Disabling any interactive features associated with attachments.
    6. **Avoid Direct Execution:** Never directly execute or open attachments.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Prevents execution of malicious code in attachments.
    *   **Malware Infection (Severity: Critical):** Scanning prevents infection.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Size limits prevent DoS.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Type validation and sandboxing help.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Near-complete mitigation (95-99%) if all steps are followed.
    *   **Malware Infection:** Very high reduction (90-95%) with scanning.
    *   **DoS:** High reduction (80-90%).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** High reduction (70-80%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Size limits in `AttachmentUploadService`, but type validation is based on file extensions only. No scanning or sandboxing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Type Validation (Magic Numbers):** Completely missing.
    *   **Malware Scanning:** No integration.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Attachments displayed directly in `YYText` without isolation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [ReDoS Prevention (for YYText-Related Regexes)](./mitigation_strategies/redos_prevention__for_yytext-related_regexes_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Regular Expressions:** List all regular expressions used *in conjunction with YYText*. This includes:
        *   Regexes used for `YYText`'s highlighting features (if you configure them).
        *   Regexes you use in your code to *process* or *extract* data from `YYText` content.
    2.  **ReDoS Analysis:** Use a tool like regex101.com (with ReDoS checker) or a library to analyze each regex.
    3.  **Rewrite Vulnerable Regexes:** Rewrite vulnerable regexes to be safer.
    4.  **Input Length Limits:** Set maximum lengths for text input that will be processed by regexes *related to YYText*. This is crucial *before* passing the text to `YYText` or using it in regex operations on `YYText` content.
    5.  **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for regex matching *when interacting with YYText*. Use `NSRegularExpression`'s `withTimeout` (or equivalent) when working with `YYText` content.
    6. **Testing:** Test thoroughly with various inputs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** ReDoS attacks can cause unresponsiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** High reduction (80-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** No ReDoS prevention. Regexes are used for highlighting, but not analyzed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **ReDoS Analysis:** No analysis.
    *   **Regex Rewriting:** Not done.
    *   **Input Length Limits:** No limits for text processed by regexes related to `YYText`.
    *   **Timeouts:** No timeouts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Link Handling (within YYText)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_link_handling__within_yytext_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **URL Validation (Strict, Before YYText):**
        *   Use `URLComponents`.
        *   **Scheme Whitelist:** *Before* creating a `YYText` link attribute, *only* allow `https://`. Reject others.
        *   **Domain Validation:** Validate the domain (whitelist or blacklist). Consider homograph attack detection.
        *   **Path/Query Validation:** If possible, validate.
    2.  **Link Confirmation (If using YYText's link handling):** If you are relying on `YYText` to handle link taps, consider a confirmation dialog showing the *full* URL. This is less direct control, but adds a layer of user awareness.
    3.  **`javascript:` URL Blocking (Absolute):** *Before* creating a link attribute in `YYText`, explicitly check for and block `javascript:`.
    4. **Custom Link Handling (Recommended):** Instead of relying on YYText's default link handling, implement *your own* link tap handling using `YYTextViewDelegate` or `YYLabelDelegate`. This gives you *complete* control over what happens when a link is tapped.  Within your custom handler:
        *   Re-validate the URL.
        *   Display a confirmation dialog.
        *   Open the URL securely using `UIApplication.shared.open`.
    5. **Noopener/Noreferrer (If using YYText to open in a webview):** If, for some reason, you are using YYText to open links in a webview, ensure `rel="noopener noreferrer"` is set.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Preventing `javascript:` URLs and validating others.
    *   **Phishing (Severity: High):** Validation and confirmation.
    *   **Malware Download (Severity: High):** Controlling URLs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Very high reduction (90-95%).
    *   **Phishing:** High reduction (70-80%).
    *   **Malware Download:** Moderate reduction (50-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic URL validation (checks for `http://` or `https://`), but no domain validation, no confirmation, and `javascript:` is not blocked.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Strict Scheme Whitelist:** Only `https://`.
    *   **Domain Validation:** Missing.
    *   **Link Confirmation:** Missing.
    *   **`javascript:` URL Blocking:** Critically missing.
    *   **Custom Link Handling:** Not implemented; relying on YYText's default.
    *   **Noopener/Noreferrer:** Not used.
