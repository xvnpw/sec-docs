## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Buffer Overflow in YYText Core [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in YYText's memory management by providing input that exceeds buffer boundaries, potentially overwriting critical memory regions and gaining control of program execution.
    *   **Critical Nodes:**
        *   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker creates specially crafted input, such as extremely long strings or unusual Unicode sequences, designed to trigger a buffer overflow.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **1.1.1.1.2 Bypass input validation in the *application* using YYText:** The attacker circumvents any input validation implemented by the application, allowing the malicious input to reach YYText. This highlights the *application's* responsibility.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low

*   **1.2 Exploit Logic Errors in YYText Parsing/Rendering [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in YYText's parsing or rendering logic to cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to code execution in unintended contexts.
    *   **Critical Nodes:**
        *   **1.2.1 Craft Malicious Input to Trigger Unexpected Behavior:** The attacker creates input that, while not necessarily overflowing buffers, exploits inconsistencies or edge cases in YYText's logic to trigger unintended code paths.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

*   **1.3 Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    * **Description:** If YYText uses deserialization of data (e.g., to load configurations or attributed strings), attackers can craft malicious serialized data to execute arbitrary code.
    * **Critical Nodes:**
        *   **1.3.1 If YYText uses any form of deserialization for attributed strings or configurations. [CRITICAL NODE - IF APPLICABLE]:** This node's criticality *depends entirely on whether YYText uses deserialization*. If it does, this is a very high-risk area.
            *   Likelihood: Low (conditional on deserialization being used)
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exfiltration.md)

*   **2.2 Exfiltrate Data Through Application Using YYText [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

    *   **Description:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in how the *application* handles YYText output to exfiltrate data. This often involves injecting malicious content (e.g., JavaScript in a web application) that steals data.
    *   **Critical Nodes:**
        *   **2.2.1 If the application displays YYText output without proper sanitization. [CRITICAL NODE]:** This highlights the application's responsibility to sanitize output and prevent injection attacks.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **3.1 Crash YYText (and thus the Application) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

    *   **Description:** Attackers provide input designed to cause YYText (and consequently, the application) to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   **Critical Nodes:**
        *   **3.1.1 Craft Input to Trigger Segmentation Faults/Exceptions [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker creates input that causes a segmentation fault or unhandled exception within YYText, leading to a crash.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Low
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low

*   **3.1.2 Cause Infinite Loops or Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

    *   **Description:** Attackers provide input that causes YYText to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Critical Nodes:**
        *   **3.1.2.1 Provide input that triggers excessive memory allocation. [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker crafts input that forces YYText to allocate a large amount of memory, potentially exhausting available resources.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
