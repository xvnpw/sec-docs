# Threat Model Analysis for ibireme/yytext

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Text Input Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_text_input_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted text input containing excessive or deeply nested formatting attributes, extremely long strings without breaks, or other resource-intensive patterns. `yytext` attempts to parse and render this input, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources on the server or client.
- **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing its functionality. On the server-side, this could lead to service outages. On the client-side, it could freeze or crash the user's browser.
- **Affected Component:** Parser, Renderer, Layout Engine
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement input validation and sanitization to limit the complexity and size of text input before passing it to `yytext`.
    - Set resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory usage) specifically for `yytext`'s processing.
    - Implement timeouts for `yytext`'s rendering processes.
    - Consider isolating `yytext`'s rendering in a separate process or worker thread to limit the impact of a DoS.

## Threat: [Unintended Execution of Embedded Code (If Applicable and Supported by Future `yytext` Features)](./threats/unintended_execution_of_embedded_code__if_applicable_and_supported_by_future__yytext__features_.md)

- **Description:** If future versions of `yytext` introduce features that allow embedding or interpreting code snippets within the text, attackers could inject malicious code that gets executed on the server or client when `yytext` processes it.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution, data theft, complete compromise of the server or client.
- **Affected Component:** Potentially new code execution or scripting engine within `yytext`
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - If such features are introduced, enforce strict input sanitization and validation to prevent code injection before `yytext` processes the input.
    - Implement a robust security sandbox if code execution within `yytext` is necessary.
    - Follow the principle of least privilege for any code execution capabilities within `yytext`.
