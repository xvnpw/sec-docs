## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Pagination and Data Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/implement_pagination_and_data_limiting.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Pagination and Data Limiting

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Large Lists:** Determine which lists in your application, managed by `iglistkit`, are likely to display a large number of items (e.g., feeds, search results).
    2.  **Implement Paged Data Fetching:** Modify your data fetching logic to retrieve data in smaller, manageable pages instead of loading all data at once.
        *   When fetching data for your `ListAdapter`, request data in chunks from your data source (API, database, etc.).
        *   Define a page size and implement logic to request the next page of data as the user scrolls or reaches the end of the current list.
    3.  **Update `ListAdapter` Incrementally:**  Update your `ListAdapter`'s data source by appending new pages of data as they are fetched, instead of replacing the entire data source. This ensures `iglistkit` diffs and renders only the new items efficiently.
    4.  **Limit Initial Load:** Set a reasonable limit on the number of items initially loaded by `iglistkit`. Avoid loading an extremely large dataset when the list is first displayed.
    5.  **Consider Placeholder Items:** While loading new pages, consider using placeholder items in your `ListAdapter` to provide visual feedback to the user and prevent a jarring experience of sudden content appearance.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Inefficient Diffing/Rendering (High Severity):**  Loading and diffing extremely large datasets in `iglistkit` can lead to excessive CPU and memory usage, causing UI freezes, application crashes, and potentially a denial of service if an attacker can force the application to process massive lists.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS due to Inefficient Diffing/Rendering:** Significantly reduces the risk. By limiting the data processed by `iglistkit` at any given time, pagination prevents resource exhaustion and improves application responsiveness, mitigating the DoS threat.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** Implemented in `FeedListAdapter` and `SearchListAdapter` for the main feed and search results lists.
    *   **Details:**  Both feed and search results lists use paged API requests and incrementally update their `ListAdapter` data sources. Initial load is limited to a reasonable page size.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:**  Comment lists within post detail views are currently loading all comments at once using `PostDetailListAdapter`.
    *   **Details:** Pagination needs to be implemented for comment loading in `PostDetailListAdapter` to prevent performance issues when posts have a very large number of comments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Data Models for Diffing](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_data_models_for_diffing.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Optimize Data Models for Diffing

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `iglistkit` Data Models:** Identify the data models (classes or structs) that you are using with your `iglistkit` `ListAdapter` and `ListBinder` classes.
    2.  **Efficient `Equatable` and `Hashable`:** Ensure your data models efficiently conform to the `Equatable` and `Hashable` protocols, which are crucial for `iglistkit`'s diffing algorithm.
        *   **Compare Relevant Properties:** In your `Equatable` implementation (`==` function), only compare the properties that actually influence the UI representation and need to trigger a UI update in `iglistkit`. Avoid comparing large or irrelevant properties.
        *   **Optimize `hash(into:)`:** In your `Hashable` implementation, combine the hash values of the same relevant properties used in `Equatable`. A well-distributed hash function minimizes collisions and speeds up diffing.
        *   **Avoid Complex Computations:** Keep the `Equatable` and `Hashable` implementations lightweight. Avoid performing complex calculations or expensive operations within these methods, as they are called frequently by `iglistkit`.
    3.  **Consider Value Types (Structs):**  Where appropriate, use structs (value types) for your `iglistkit` data models. Structs often have more performant default `Equatable` and `Hashable` implementations compared to classes (reference types), especially if they primarily contain value-type properties.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Inefficient Diffing (Medium Severity):**  Inefficient `Equatable` and `Hashable` implementations in data models used by `iglistkit` can significantly slow down the diffing process, leading to UI delays, increased CPU usage, and potential DoS if the application is subjected to frequent data updates or large datasets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS due to Inefficient Diffing:** Moderately reduces the risk. Optimized data models improve `iglistkit`'s diffing performance, making the application more responsive and resilient to performance-related DoS attacks, especially when dealing with dynamic lists.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** Implemented for `FeedPost` and `User` data models used in `FeedListAdapter` and `UserListAdapter`.
    *   **Details:** `FeedPost` and `User` structs have custom `Equatable` and `Hashable` implementations that focus on comparing only UI-relevant properties like text content, image URLs, and interaction counts.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:**  Data models for comments (`Comment` class) and messages (`ChatMessage` class) used in `PostDetailListAdapter` and `ChatListAdapter` are currently using default `Equatable` and `Hashable` implementations.
    *   **Details:** `Comment` and `ChatMessage` classes should be refactored to structs or have their `Equatable` and `Hashable` implementations optimized, particularly if comment and chat message lists are expected to grow large or update frequently.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thoroughly Review and Test `ListAdapter` and `ListBinder` Implementations](./mitigation_strategies/thoroughly_review_and_test__listadapter__and__listbinder__implementations.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Thoroughly Review and Test `ListAdapter` and `ListBinder` Implementations

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated Code Reviews for `iglistkit` Components:** Implement a mandatory code review process specifically for all code changes related to `iglistkit` components, including `ListAdapter`, `ListBinder`, and related data source logic.
        *   Ensure that reviewers have a good understanding of `iglistkit` best practices and potential pitfalls.
        *   Focus reviews on data handling logic, correct usage of `iglistkit` APIs, and potential performance implications.
    2.  **Unit Testing for Adapters and Binders:** Write comprehensive unit tests specifically targeting your `ListAdapter` and `ListBinder` classes.
        *   Test data transformations within adapters, data binding logic in binders, and handling of different data states (empty, loading, error, populated).
        *   Use mock data and dependency injection to isolate and test the logic within `iglistkit` components.
    3.  **UI Testing for List Rendering:** Implement UI tests to verify the correct rendering and behavior of lists managed by `iglistkit` in various scenarios.
        *   Test list updates, scrolling performance, item appearance, and data display accuracy across different device types and screen sizes.
        *   Use UI testing frameworks (like XCTest UI) to automate these tests and ensure consistent list behavior.
    4.  **Security-Focused Review Checklist:** Create a checklist for code reviewers specifically focused on security aspects within `iglistkit` components.
        *   Include items to check for potential data exposure in binders, correct data sanitization before display, and proper error handling within adapters and binders.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure through Incorrect Data Handling in Adapters/Binders (High Severity):**  Logic errors or vulnerabilities in `ListAdapter` and `ListBinder` code can lead to accidental exposure of sensitive data in the UI, unintended data modifications, or incorrect data display.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure through Incorrect Data Handling in Adapters/Binders:** Significantly reduces the risk. Rigorous review and testing of `iglistkit` components help identify and prevent data handling errors and vulnerabilities before they reach production, minimizing the risk of data exposure.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** Code review process is in place for all code changes, including `iglistkit` related code. Basic unit tests exist for data models and utility functions.
    *   **Details:**  All pull requests require code review. Unit tests cover some data model logic, but specific unit tests for `ListAdapter` and `ListBinder` are limited. UI testing is primarily manual.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:**  Dedicated unit tests and UI tests specifically for `ListAdapter` and `ListBinder` classes are needed. Security-focused review checklist for `iglistkit` components is not yet defined.
    *   **Details:** Expand unit test coverage to thoroughly test `ListAdapter` and `ListBinder` logic. Implement automated UI tests to verify list rendering and behavior. Develop and implement a security checklist for reviewers to specifically focus on data handling and potential vulnerabilities within `iglistkit` components.
