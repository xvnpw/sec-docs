# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: Provide a reusable, efficient, and flexible framework for building lists and collections in iOS applications.
  - Priority: Performance and developer productivity. The framework aims to simplify the development of complex lists while maintaining high performance, especially for applications with large datasets and frequent updates. This leads to improved user experience in applications that adopt the framework.

- Business Risks:
  - Business Risk: Adoption risk. If the framework is difficult to use, poorly documented, or has significant bugs, developers may not adopt it, reducing its impact and value.
  - Business Risk: Performance regressions. If updates to the framework introduce performance issues, applications using it could suffer, negatively impacting user experience.
  - Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the framework could be inherited by applications using it, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents in those applications.
  - Business Risk: Dependency risk. Applications become dependent on this framework, and any issues with its maintenance or future availability could impact those applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Reviews. The project is open source and hosted on GitHub, suggesting that code reviews are likely part of the development process, although not explicitly stated. Location: GitHub repository history and pull request discussions (inferred).
  - security control: Static Analysis. It's common practice in software development to use static analysis tools, although there is no explicit mention in the repository. Location: Potentially integrated into CI/CD pipelines (inferred).
  - security control: Unit and Integration Testing. The repository likely includes unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality. Location: Test directories within the GitHub repository (inferred).
  - security control: Open Source. Being open source allows for community scrutiny and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Location: GitHub repository.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching. The project's security posture is partly dependent on the active open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on underlying iOS platform security. The framework relies on the security features and robustness of the iOS operating system and SDK.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning. Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities in the framework code and its dependencies.
  - security control: Security focused code reviews. Emphasize security considerations during code reviews, specifically looking for common vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation issues, memory safety problems).
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy. Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to provide a channel for security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  - security control: Security testing as part of CI/CD. Integrate security testing (e.g., fuzzing, penetration testing) into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing security assessment.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a framework. Authentication is handled by the applications that use this framework.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a framework. Authorization is handled by the applications that use this framework.
  - Input Validation: The framework should perform input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to invalid or malformed data passed to its APIs. This is crucial for robustness and can indirectly contribute to security by preventing denial-of-service or other unexpected issues. Location: Within the framework's code, specifically in methods that accept external input.
  - Cryptography:  The framework itself is unlikely to require cryptography directly. However, if it handles or processes any sensitive data (even indirectly), appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered.  It's more likely that applications using the framework will handle cryptography.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Ensuring the performance and stability of iOS applications that use `iglistkit`, especially for Instagram's own application.
  - Maintaining developer trust and adoption of the framework by providing a reliable and secure solution.
  - Protecting the reputation of the project and the organizations using it from potential security vulnerabilities in the framework.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The `iglistkit` framework itself does not directly handle sensitive user data. However, applications using the framework will handle various types of data, some of which may be sensitive (user profiles, personal information, etc.).
  - The framework's security is important to ensure that it does not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise the data handled by applications using it.
  - The framework's code itself is publicly available and open source, so there is no confidentiality concern for the code itself.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Question: What is the primary target audience for `iglistkit`? Is it primarily for internal Instagram development or is it intended for broader external community adoption?
  - Assumption: While initially developed for Instagram, `iglistkit` is intended to be a general-purpose framework for iOS developers, both internal and external.
  - Question: What are the key performance metrics that `iglistkit` aims to improve?
  - Assumption: The primary performance goals are to improve list rendering speed, reduce memory usage, and enhance the responsiveness of list-based UIs in iOS applications.

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Question: Are there any known security vulnerabilities in `iglistkit`?
  - Assumption: Based on the public nature of the repository and lack of prominent security advisories, it is assumed there are no known critical security vulnerabilities at this time, but ongoing security assessment is necessary.
  - Question: What security testing practices are currently in place for `iglistkit`?
  - Assumption: Code reviews and basic testing are likely in place, but more proactive security measures like automated SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning are recommended for enhanced security posture.
  - Question: Is there a vulnerability disclosure policy for `iglistkit`?
  - Assumption:  There is no explicitly stated vulnerability disclosure policy. It is recommended to establish one to facilitate responsible vulnerability reporting.

- DESIGN:
  - Question: What are the key architectural components within `iglistkit`?
  - Assumption: `iglistkit` likely uses components for data diffing, view management, and efficient updates to collection views, but detailed internal architecture is not fully explored in this document.
  - Question: What are the external dependencies of `iglistkit` beyond the iOS SDK?
  - Assumption: `iglistkit` primarily relies on the iOS SDK and standard Swift/Objective-C libraries. External dependencies are assumed to be minimal, but dependency scanning should be performed to confirm.
  - Question: What is the process for updating and maintaining `iglistkit`?
  - Assumption: Updates are likely driven by feature requests, bug fixes, and performance improvements, with contributions potentially coming from both internal Instagram developers and the external open-source community. Maintenance and updates are assumed to follow standard open-source project practices.
