# Threat Model Analysis for instagram/iglistkit

## Threat: [Data Integrity Violation via Diffing Logic Manipulation (High Severity)](./threats/data_integrity_violation_via_diffing_logic_manipulation__high_severity_.md)

- **Threat:** Data Integrity Violation via Diffing Logic Manipulation
- **Description:**
    - **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in data handling or data sources to inject malicious data. When processed by IGListKit's diffing algorithm, this leads to the display of incorrect, manipulated, or even malicious information within the application's UI.
    - **How:** This could involve compromising backend APIs to return altered data, or exploiting input validation flaws to inject crafted data that bypasses expected structures and triggers incorrect diffing. The attacker aims to display misleading or false information, potentially leading to user manipulation, misinformation, or enabling unauthorized actions if the displayed data influences application logic.
- **Impact:**
    - Display of critically incorrect or manipulated data, leading to user misinformation or manipulation.
    - Erosion of user trust and severe damage to application reputation.
    - Potential for financial loss or real-world harm if the application displays critical information (e.g., financial data, health information, security alerts) that is manipulated.
    - Functional errors and security vulnerabilities if application logic relies on the displayed (but incorrect) data, potentially enabling bypasses or unauthorized access.
- **Affected IGListKit Component:**
    - `ListDiffable` protocol implementation in data models.
    - Diffing algorithm within `IGListKit` core.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on all data sources to prevent injection of malicious or malformed data at every entry point.
    - **Robust Backend API Security:** Secure backend APIs and data sources with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized data modification or injection.
    - **Comprehensive `ListDiffable` Testing:**  Implement extensive unit and integration tests for `isEqual(to:)` and `diffIdentifier` in data models, covering edge cases and complex data scenarios to guarantee correct diffing behavior and prevent unexpected outcomes from manipulated data.
    - **Data Integrity Verification:** Implement server-side and client-side data integrity checks to verify data consistency and authenticity throughout the application lifecycle, ensuring displayed data matches the intended source and hasn't been tampered with.
    - **Content Security Policies:** If displaying web content within IGListKit cells, implement Content Security Policies (CSP) to mitigate risks of displaying malicious content injected via data manipulation.

## Threat: [Memory Leaks Leading to Denial of Service (High Severity)](./threats/memory_leaks_leading_to_denial_of_service__high_severity_.md)

- **Threat:** Memory Leaks Leading to Denial of Service
- **Description:**
    - **Attacker Action:** While not directly initiated by an attacker, memory leaks, if severe and persistent, can be indirectly exploited. An attacker, or even normal heavy usage patterns, can trigger actions that repeatedly allocate memory without proper deallocation in IGListKit components (especially custom `ListSectionController` implementations or data models). This eventually leads to memory exhaustion and application instability.
    - **How:** Memory leaks typically arise from improper object management in custom code interacting with IGListKit, such as strong reference cycles, incorrect closure usage, or failure to release resources in `ListSectionController` or data model lifecycle.  Prolonged use or specific user actions can exacerbate these leaks.
- **Impact:**
    - Progressive performance degradation, leading to application unresponsiveness and sluggish UI.
    - Increased battery consumption and device overheating, negatively impacting user experience.
    - Application crashes due to out-of-memory errors, resulting in data loss and service disruption.
    - Denial of service for legitimate users as the application becomes unusable or crashes frequently. In extreme cases, this can be considered a form of denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Affected IGListKit Component:**
    - Custom `ListSectionController` implementations (primary source of memory leak risks).
    - Data models used with `IGListKit`.
    - Object lifecycle management within the application's IGListKit integration.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Proactive Memory Management:** Implement rigorous memory management practices in all custom `ListSectionController` code and data models, focusing on avoiding strong reference cycles and ensuring proper object deallocation.
    - **Strategic Use of Weak References:**  Utilize weak references extensively to break potential strong reference cycles, particularly within closures, delegates, and relationships between section controllers and data models.
    - **Automated Memory Leak Detection:** Integrate automated memory leak detection tools into the development and testing pipeline (e.g., static analysis tools, Instruments in Xcode) to proactively identify and address memory leaks before release.
    - **Regular Memory Profiling and Monitoring:** Conduct regular memory profiling during development and in staging/testing environments to monitor memory usage trends and identify potential leak sources early on. Implement runtime memory monitoring in production (if feasible and without performance overhead) to detect and react to memory pressure issues.
    - **Code Reviews Focused on Memory Management:** Conduct thorough code reviews specifically focused on memory management aspects, particularly in areas involving object lifecycle, resource allocation/deallocation, and interactions with IGListKit APIs.
