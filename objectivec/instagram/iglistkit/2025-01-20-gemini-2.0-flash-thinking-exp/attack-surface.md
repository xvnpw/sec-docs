# Attack Surface Analysis for instagram/iglistkit

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection via Data Source](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection_via_data_source.md)

**Description:** The application receives data from an untrusted source and uses it as the data source for `IGListKit`. A malicious actor can inject crafted data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes or displays this data.

**How IGListKit Contributes:** `IGListKit` directly consumes the provided data source to render the UI. If the data is malicious, `IGListKit` will process and attempt to display it, potentially triggering vulnerabilities in the application's data handling or rendering logic.

**Example:** A remote server controlled by an attacker sends a response with excessively long strings for text fields or unexpected data types for image URLs, causing buffer overflows or crashes when `IGListKit` attempts to display them.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption if the application doesn't handle malformed data correctly, displaying incorrect or misleading information to the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Server-Side Validation: Implement robust validation on the server-side to ensure data conforms to the expected schema and constraints before sending it to the application.
*   Input Sanitization: Sanitize data received from untrusted sources within the application before using it as the data source for `IGListKit`. This includes escaping special characters and validating data types.
*   Data Type Enforcement: Strictly enforce data types when mapping server responses to your `ListDiffable` objects. Handle unexpected data types gracefully.
*   Error Handling: Implement robust error handling within your `ListSectionController` implementations to catch and manage potential issues during data processing and display.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom `ListAdapterDataSource` or `ListSectionController` Logic](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom__listadapterdatasource__or__listsectioncontroller__logic.md)

**Description:** Developers implement custom logic within `ListAdapterDataSource` and `ListSectionController` subclasses to manage data fetching, cell configuration, and user interactions. Vulnerabilities in this custom code can introduce security risks.

**How IGListKit Contributes:** `IGListKit` provides the framework and entry points for this custom logic. While `IGListKit` itself might be secure, vulnerabilities in the developer-written code that interacts with it are a significant attack surface.

**Example:** A `ListSectionController` fetches data from a remote API without proper error handling. If the API returns an unexpected error, the application might crash or expose sensitive error information. Incorrect index calculations within `ListAdapterDataSource` could lead to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact:** Application crash, exposure of sensitive information, denial of service, potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in the data fetching or processing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding principles when implementing custom logic. This includes proper error handling, input validation, and avoiding hardcoded credentials.
*   Regular Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews of custom `ListAdapterDataSource` and `ListSectionController` implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that the application only has the necessary permissions to access resources and perform actions.
*   Dependency Management: Keep dependencies used within your custom logic up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
