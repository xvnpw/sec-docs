## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Data Source](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_data_source.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Inject Malicious Data into Data Source *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    *   Craft Data that Triggers Unexpected iglistkit Behavior

*   **Inject Malicious Data into Data Source:**
    *   Attack Vector: If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate data before passing it to iglistkit, an attacker could inject malicious data that causes unexpected behavior.
    *   Specific Action: Crafting data with specific structures or values that break assumptions within iglistkit's diffing or rendering logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Data Binding](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_data_binding.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Insecure Data Binding *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    *   Inject Malicious Data via View Models

*   **Exploit Insecure Data Binding:**
    *   Attack Vector: The way data is bound to the UI elements in the cells can be a vulnerability.
    *   Specific Action: Injecting malicious data via view models.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft View Models with Embedded Malicious Code (e.g., URL Schemes)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_view_models_with_embedded_malicious_code__e_g___url_schemes_.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Craft View Models with Embedded Malicious Code (e.g., URL Schemes) *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Craft View Models with Embedded Malicious Code (e.g., URL Schemes):**
    *   Attack Vector: Injecting strings into view models that look like URLs but trigger malicious actions when the cell is rendered or interacted with.
    *   Specific Examples: Using `javascript:` URLs in web views within cells to execute arbitrary scripts, or crafting custom URL schemes that launch unintended applications or perform malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cell Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cell_configuration_issues.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Cell Configuration Issues *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Exploit Cell Configuration Issues:**
    *   Attack Vector: The logic within `cellForItemAt:` or custom cell configuration methods can be vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Data that Causes Crashes in Cell Configuration Logic](./attack_tree_paths/inject_data_that_causes_crashes_in_cell_configuration_logic.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Inject Data that Causes Crashes in Cell Configuration Logic *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Inject Data that Causes Crashes in Cell Configuration Logic:**
    *   Attack Vector: Providing specific data that triggers exceptions or errors within the cell configuration code.
    *   Outcome: Leads to application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Data that Leads to Information Disclosure in Cell Views](./attack_tree_paths/inject_data_that_leads_to_information_disclosure_in_cell_views.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Inject Data that Leads to Information Disclosure in Cell Views *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Inject Data that Leads to Information Disclosure in Cell Views:**
    *   Attack Vector: Crafting data that, when displayed in a cell, reveals sensitive information that should not be accessible in that context.
    *   Examples: Displaying internal IDs, private user data, or API keys within a cell that is visible to unauthorized users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Developer Misconfiguration/Misuse of iglistkit](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_developer_misconfigurationmisuse_of_iglistkit.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Developer Misconfiguration/Misuse of iglistkit *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Exploit Developer Misconfiguration/Misuse of iglistkit:**
    *   Attack Vector: Developers might make mistakes in implementing iglistkit, leading to exploitable vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect Implementation of `ListSectionController`](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_implementation_of__listsectioncontroller_.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Incorrect Implementation of `ListSectionController` *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Exploit Incorrect Implementation of `ListSectionController`:**
    *   Attack Vector: Developers might make mistakes in implementing the `ListSectionController` lifecycle methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect Handling of Cell Reuse](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_handling_of_cell_reuse.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Incorrect Handling of Cell Reuse *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Exploit Incorrect Handling of Cell Reuse:**
    *   Attack Vector: If cell reuse is not handled correctly, sensitive data from previous cells might be displayed in new cells.
    *   Outcome: Leads to information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Handling of User Input within Cells](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_handling_of_user_input_within_cells.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Insecure Handling of User Input within Cells *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Exploit Insecure Handling of User Input within Cells:**
    *   Attack Vector: If cells contain input fields, and the input is not properly sanitized or validated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Input that is Not Sanitized Before Display](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_input_that_is_not_sanitized_before_display.md)

**CRITICAL NODE** Inject Malicious Input that is Not Sanitized Before Display *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

*   **Inject Malicious Input that is Not Sanitized Before Display:**
    *   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts or code into input fields that are then displayed without proper sanitization.
    *   Outcome: Can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) within the application, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the app's context or steal user data.
