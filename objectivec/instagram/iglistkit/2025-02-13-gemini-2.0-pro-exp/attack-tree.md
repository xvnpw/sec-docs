# Attack Tree Analysis for instagram/iglistkit

Objective: To degrade application performance, cause denial-of-service (DoS), or leak sensitive information displayed within the IGListKit-powered UI, by exploiting IGListKit-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Degrade Performance/DoS [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/degrade_performancedos__high_.md)

*   **1.1 Infinite Scrolling DoS [HIGH] (Critical Node)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates the data source (e.g., a server API) to continuously return new, non-duplicate items when the application requests more data for infinite scrolling. This causes the `ListAdapter` to keep adding new cells, consuming memory without bound, and eventually crashing the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  Relatively easy to attempt if the application lacks proper server-side limits.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Leads to application crashes and denial of service for all users.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Requires manipulating server responses, which might involve intercepting network traffic or exploiting server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.  Basic understanding of HTTP requests and potentially some knowledge of server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Increased memory usage and application crashes are noticeable, but pinpointing the cause requires investigation.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strict server-side validation and pagination limits.
        *   Implement client-side rate limiting for fetching new data.
        *   Monitor memory usage and implement safeguards to unload older sections.
        *   Thoroughly test with extremely large datasets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak Sensitive Information [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/leak_sensitive_information__high_.md)

*   **2.1 Data Source Hijacking [HIGH] (Critical Node)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains control of the data source that feeds the `ListAdapter`. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack (intercepting network traffic), compromising the server providing the data, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's network communication. The attacker can then inject malicious data or expose sensitive information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium.  Depends heavily on the security of the network and server infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Can lead to the exposure of sensitive user data, potentially including personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other confidential information.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.  Requires significant effort, such as intercepting encrypted traffic or exploiting server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.  Requires knowledge of network security, cryptography, and potentially server-side exploitation techniques.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  Difficult to detect without network monitoring, intrusion detection systems, or server-side security audits.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use HTTPS and ensure proper certificate validation.
        *   Sanitize all data received from the data source.
        *   Validate the structure and content of received data.
        *   Implement robust server-side security measures.
        *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.
