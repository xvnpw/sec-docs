## Attack Surface: [Malicious `ListDiffable` Data (Targeting Diffing Algorithm)](./attack_surfaces/malicious__listdiffable__data__targeting_diffing_algorithm_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can provide specifically crafted data to `ListDiffable` objects designed to exploit the computational complexity of IGListKit's diffing algorithm. This is distinct from simply displaying bad data; it targets the *diffing process itself*.

**How IGListKit Contributes:** IGListKit's core diffing algorithm (`ListAdapter.performUpdates(animated:completion:)` and related methods) is the direct target. The vulnerability lies in how the algorithm handles maliciously crafted `diffIdentifier` values or `isEqual(toDiffableObject:)` implementations.

**Example:** An attacker submits a series of objects with `diffIdentifier` values that are very similar but not identical, or objects where `isEqual(toDiffableObject:)` has been deliberately made extremely slow (e.g., through nested loops or recursive calls with controlled input), forcing the diffing algorithm into a worst-case performance scenario.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) â€“ the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive CPU usage during the diffing process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Focus on `diffIdentifier`):**  Implement rigorous validation of *all* data used to generate `diffIdentifier` values. Enforce strict length limits, character restrictions (e.g., disallow control characters), and potentially even format restrictions (e.g., if identifiers are expected to be UUIDs, enforce UUID format).
        *   **Complexity Analysis of `isEqual(toDiffableObject:)`:**  Carefully analyze the time complexity of your `isEqual(toDiffableObject:)` implementations.  Avoid complex comparisons if possible, especially for data that might originate from untrusted sources.  Favor simple, constant-time comparisons whenever feasible.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Updates to `ListAdapter`):**  Implement strict rate limiting on calls to `ListAdapter.performUpdates(animated:completion:)`. This prevents an attacker from flooding the system with malicious updates designed to trigger the diffing algorithm repeatedly.  Consider a combination of per-user and global rate limits.
        *   **Timeout for Diffing Operations:** Consider implementing a timeout mechanism for the diffing operation itself. If the diffing process takes longer than a predefined threshold, terminate it and potentially log an error. This prevents a single malicious update from indefinitely blocking the UI thread.
        * **Profiling and Monitoring:** Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the diffing process during development and testing. Monitor application performance in production to detect potential DoS attacks targeting the diffing algorithm.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly in IGListKit)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_in_iglistkit_.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists *within* the IGListKit library itself (not its dependencies, but the IGListKit code directly), allowing for exploitation.

**How IGListKit Contributes:** The vulnerability is inherent to IGListKit's code.

**Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in IGListKit's internal handling of section controllers could allow an attacker to trigger a crash or, in a more severe (and less likely) scenario, potentially gain some limited control over application behavior. This would require a flaw in IGListKit's own logic, not just misuse by the developer.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Could range from Denial of Service (DoS) to potentially more severe consequences, depending on the nature of the flaw.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Keep IGListKit Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation. Regularly update to the latest stable release of IGListKit to receive security patches.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor for security advisories related to IGListKit. Subscribe to relevant mailing lists, follow the project's GitHub repository, or use security scanning tools that track vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
        *   **Rapid Response to Patches:** When a security patch is released for IGListKit, prioritize updating your application as quickly as possible.
        * **(If you discover a vulnerability):** Responsibly disclose the vulnerability to the IGListKit maintainers following established security disclosure practices.
