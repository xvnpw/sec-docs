## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection into `ListDiffable` Objects](./threats/malicious_data_injection_into__listdiffable__objects.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection into `ListDiffable` Objects

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides crafted input to the application that, when processed, results in malformed or unexpected `ListDiffable` objects being passed to IGListKit. The attacker's goal is to exploit how IGListKit and its section controllers handle this unexpected data.  This is *not* a general data validation issue; it's specifically about how IGListKit reacts to malformed data models. The attacker might craft data that:
        *   Causes the wrong `IGListSectionController` to be selected.
        *   Causes a section controller to be initialized with incorrect data, leading to display of attacker-controlled content.
        *   Triggers edge cases or vulnerabilities in custom `ListDiffable` comparison logic.
    *   **Impact:** Display of incorrect or attacker-controlled content within the list.  This could range from displaying misleading information to potentially executing malicious code *if* the receiving `IGListSectionController` has vulnerabilities in how it handles the injected data (e.g., rendering arbitrary HTML or executing JavaScript). Crashes or unexpected UI behavior are also possible.
    *   **Affected IGListKit Component:** `IGListAdapterDataSource`, specifically the `objects(for:)` method, and any custom `ListDiffable` implementations.  Crucially, any `IGListSectionController` that receives and processes the malicious data is directly affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation *Before* IGListKit:** Implement rigorous validation of *all* data *before* it's used to create `ListDiffable` objects. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Use schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema, Swift Codable with strict decoding) to ensure data conforms to expected types and structures *before* it reaches IGListKit.
        *   **Type Safety:** Leverage Swift's type system to enforce strong typing and prevent the creation of `ListDiffable` objects with incorrect data types. This helps prevent unexpected data from reaching section controllers.
        *   **Defensive Programming in Section Controllers:**  `IGListSectionController` implementations *must* be robust against unexpected data.  Even with upstream validation, section controllers should *re-validate* data before using it to configure cells.  Handle potential errors gracefully. This is a critical "defense in depth" measure.
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize any data that might contain user-generated content or potentially malicious input before displaying it, *especially* within custom section controllers.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure in Custom Section Controllers](./threats/information_disclosure_in_custom_section_controllers.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure in Custom Section Controllers

    *   **Description:** A custom `IGListSectionController` inadvertently displays sensitive data that should be hidden. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability lies within the IGListKit component (the section controller) responsible for rendering data. The attacker doesn't necessarily inject data; they exploit a flaw in *how* the section controller presents existing data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of private user data, potentially leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or other harm. The severity depends on the sensitivity of the disclosed data.
    *   **Affected IGListKit Component:** Custom `IGListSectionController` implementations, specifically the `cellForItem(at:)`, `sizeForItem(at:)`, and any methods that handle data display. The vulnerability is *within* the section controller's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization:** Only pass the *minimum* necessary data to section controllers. Avoid passing entire data objects if only a few fields are needed. This reduces the attack surface.
        *   **Data Masking/Redaction:** Mask or redact sensitive data before displaying it in the UI *within the section controller*. For example, display only the last four digits of a credit card number.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices within section controllers, paying close attention to data handling and display. This is fundamental.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of *all* custom section controller implementations, focusing specifically on security and privacy. A second pair of eyes is crucial.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Data Access):** Ensure section controllers only have access to the data they absolutely need to render their cells.

## Threat: [Tampering with Section Controller Interactions](./threats/tampering_with_section_controller_interactions.md)

*   **Threat:** Tampering with Section Controller Interactions

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a custom `IGListSectionController`'s handling of user interactions (e.g., taps, gestures) to trigger unintended actions. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability lies within the IGListKit component (the section controller) responsible for handling user input. The attacker might try to:
        *   Bypass security checks within the section controller.
        *   Trigger unexpected state changes.
        *   Manipulate data passed back to the application from the section controller.
    *   **Impact:** Unintended actions within the application, potentially leading to data modification, unauthorized access, or other security breaches. The specific impact depends on the functionality exposed by the section controller and how it interacts with the rest of the application.
    *   **Affected IGListKit Component:** Custom `IGListSectionController` implementations, specifically methods that handle user interactions (e.g., `didSelectItem(at:)`, `didDeselectItem(at:)`, and any custom gesture recognizers). The vulnerability is *within* the section controller's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* user input within section controllers, ensuring that it conforms to expected values and formats. This includes validating data associated with taps, gestures, and other interactions.
        *   **State Management:** Carefully manage the state of the section controller, and ensure that state transitions are handled securely and predictably.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices within section controllers, paying close attention to input handling and state management.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of *all* custom section controller implementations, focusing on security and input handling.
        *   **Least Privilege (Application Interaction):** Design section controllers to have the minimum necessary privileges to perform their intended functions. Avoid granting them direct access to sensitive resources or operations. Use well-defined interfaces to communicate with the rest of the application.
