# Attack Surface Analysis for instagram/iglistkit

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Malformed Data in Data Source](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_malformed_data_in_data_source.md)

* **Description:** The application receives data from an external or internal source that is intentionally malicious or unintentionally malformed.
* **How IGListKit Contributes:** IGListKit directly processes this data to update the UI. If the data doesn't conform to expected types or structures, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior during the diffing or view rendering stages.
* **Example:** A network API returns a string where an integer was expected in a data model used by IGListKit. This could cause a runtime error when IGListKit attempts to process this data for display.
* **Impact:** Application crash, unexpected UI behavior, potential for further exploitation if error handling is poor.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust input validation on all data *before* passing it to IGListKit.
    * Sanitize data to remove potentially harmful characters or structures.
    * Use defensive programming with error handling around data processing and view updates.
    * Validate data against a predefined schema if using structured data formats.
