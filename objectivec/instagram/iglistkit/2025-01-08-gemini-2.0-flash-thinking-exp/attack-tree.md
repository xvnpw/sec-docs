## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_execute_arbitrary_code.md)

This represents the ultimate goal for an attacker seeking to gain full control over the application. Success here allows the attacker to perform actions such as accessing sensitive data, modifying application behavior, or using the device for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Malicious Data Injection via ListAdapter](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_malicious_data_injection_via_listadapter.md)

This is a critical entry point because the `ListAdapter` is central to how `iglistkit` manages and processes data. Successfully injecting malicious data here can lead to various exploits:
    *   **Inject Malicious Objects:** Crafting specific data objects that, when processed by `ListAdapter`'s diffing or rendering logic, trigger unexpected behavior leading to code execution (e.g., through custom cell configurations or data binding).
    *   **Exploit Type Confusion:** Providing data of an unexpected type that, when handled by `iglistkit`'s internal type checks or casting, leads to memory corruption or unsafe operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploiting Custom ListSectionController Logic](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_custom_listsectioncontroller_logic.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by developers in their custom `ListSectionController` implementations.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Code:** Exploiting weaknesses in the developer's custom `ListSectionController` implementations (e.g., insecure data handling, lack of input validation) that can be triggered through `iglistkit`'s lifecycle methods. Since developers have direct control over this code, vulnerabilities are often specific to the application and might not be present in `iglistkit` itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploiting View Binding Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_view_binding_mechanisms.md)

This path targets the way `iglistkit` binds data to UI elements.
    *   **Malicious Data in View Models:** Injecting malicious data into view models that, when bound to UI elements by `iglistkit`, triggers code execution (e.g., through embedded scripts in text views if not properly sanitized). This is similar to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Cause Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_cause_denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

While not leading to code execution, this path can significantly impact the application's availability and user experience.
    *   **Overwhelm Rendering Pipeline:** Providing extremely large datasets that cause `iglistkit` to allocate excessive UI elements, leading to memory exhaustion and application crashes. This attack is relatively straightforward to execute if the application doesn't implement proper data loading limits or pagination.
