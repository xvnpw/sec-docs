# Threat Model Analysis for instagram/iglistkit

## Threat: [Data Inconsistency Leading to Crashes](./threats/data_inconsistency_leading_to_crashes.md)

* **Threat:** Data Inconsistency Leading to Crashes
    * **Description:** An attacker could craft or manipulate data in a way that exposes edge cases or bugs within IGListKit's diffing algorithm (`IGListDiff`). This manipulation could lead to inconsistencies between the data model and the UI state managed by IGListKit, causing the application to access invalid memory locations or enter unexpected states, resulting in a crash.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, leading to a denial of service for the user. Potential data corruption within the application's state if the crash occurs during a data update.
    * **Which https://github.com/instagram/iglistkit component is affected:** `ListAdapter`'s diffing algorithm (e.g., `IGListDiff`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust data validation before passing data to the `ListAdapter`.
        * Ensure data models conform strictly to the requirements of the diffing algorithm, including stable and unique identifiers and correct equality implementations.
        * Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests, specifically targeting edge cases and complex data transformations that might interact with the diffing algorithm.
        * Consider using immutable data structures to reduce the risk of unintended data mutations that could lead to inconsistencies.

## Threat: [Using Outdated IGListKit with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_outdated_iglistkit_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Using Outdated IGListKit with Known Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Developers might fail to update the IGListKit library, leaving the application vulnerable to publicly known security flaws within IGListKit itself that have been addressed in newer versions. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the application's version of IGListKit. The specific nature of the exploit depends on the vulnerability.
    * **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from unexpected behavior and crashes to potential remote code execution or data breaches if a severe vulnerability exists within the outdated IGListKit code.
    * **Which https://github.com/instagram/iglistkit component is affected:** The entire IGListKit library.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update IGListKit to the latest stable version.
        * Monitor the IGListKit repository for release notes and security advisories.
        * Implement a robust dependency management system to track and manage library updates, ensuring timely updates for security patches.
        * Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address any known vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies.
