# Attack Surface Analysis for mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Swipe Actions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_swipe_actions.md)

*   **Description:** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the type or parameters of a swipe action before processing it.
    *   **How mgswipetablecell Contributes:** The library provides the mechanism for triggering actions based on swipe gestures. If the application blindly trusts the information about which action was triggered, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A user performs a left swipe intended to "archive" an item. An attacker manipulates the swipe event (e.g., through a compromised accessibility service or by intercepting the event) to be interpreted as a "delete" action by the application's logic, bypassing confirmation steps.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification or deletion, bypassing intended workflows.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Validation:**  Always validate the intended action on the server-side based on the user's permissions and the current state of the data, regardless of the client-side swipe action.
        *   **Explicit Action Identification:** Instead of relying solely on the swipe direction, pass a specific identifier for the intended action when the swipe is triggered.
        *   **Confirmation Steps:** For critical actions (like deletion), implement confirmation dialogs or undo mechanisms to prevent accidental or malicious actions.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Action Titles/Descriptions](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_custom_action_titlesdescriptions.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows dynamic content (potentially user-controlled) to be used in the titles or descriptions of swipe actions without proper sanitization.
    *   **How mgswipetablecell Contributes:** The library renders the UI elements, including the titles and descriptions of the swipe actions. If the application passes unsanitized data to the library for these elements, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** The application allows users to name their custom lists. This name is then used as part of a swipe action title (e.g., "Delete List: [User Provided Name]"). If the user provides a malicious name like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this script could be executed when another user views the swipe options.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions within the user's session.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided input before using it in the titles or descriptions of swipe actions. Encode HTML entities to prevent script execution.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of any potential XSS vulnerabilities.
