# Threat Model Analysis for mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell

## Threat: [Malicious Swipe Input](./threats/malicious_swipe_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft specific or unexpected swipe gestures or manipulate the data directly associated with the swipe action *as it is being processed by the library*. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how the library parses or handles swipe events, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or allowing the injection of malicious data that the application might then process.

**Impact:** Could lead to the execution of unintended actions *due to a flaw in the library's input handling*, potentially bypassing application-level validation if the malicious input is processed before the application receives it. This could result in data corruption or other unexpected application states.

**Affected Component:** Swipe event handling within the `mgswipetablecell` library, specifically the modules or functions responsible for interpreting touch events and determining the swipe action.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review the `mgswipetablecell` library's code for vulnerabilities related to input handling and event processing.
*   Consider forking the repository and applying security patches or improvements if necessary.
*   Implement a secondary layer of input validation within the application specifically for data or parameters derived from swipe actions, even if the library performs some validation.

## Threat: [Potential for Memory Corruption or Unexpected Behavior due to Library Bugs](./threats/potential_for_memory_corruption_or_unexpected_behavior_due_to_library_bugs.md)

**Description:** Due to potential bugs or vulnerabilities within the `mgswipetablecell` library's code itself (e.g., buffer overflows, incorrect memory management), specific swipe patterns or a high volume of swipe events could trigger unexpected behavior, crashes, or even memory corruption within the application. This is a risk inherent in using third-party libraries.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, or potentially exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be leveraged for more serious attacks.

**Affected Component:** Core modules and functions within the `mgswipetablecell` library responsible for handling touch events, managing internal state, and rendering UI elements.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest versions of the `mgswipetablecell` library and monitor for reported security vulnerabilities or bug fixes.
*   Conduct thorough testing of the application's integration with the library, including stress testing with rapid and varied swipe inputs.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the `mgswipetablecell` library's code for potential vulnerabilities (though this requires access to the library's source code).
*   Implement robust error handling and crash reporting within the application to quickly identify and address issues potentially caused by the library.
