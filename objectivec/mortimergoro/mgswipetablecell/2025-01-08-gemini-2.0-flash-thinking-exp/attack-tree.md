## Attack Tree Path: [Path 1: Trigger Unintended Actions via Swipe through Race Conditions and Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/path_1_trigger_unintended_actions_via_swipe_through_race_conditions_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a race condition in the `mgswipetablecell` library's gesture processing. This allows them to manipulate the timing of swipe events. Subsequently, they leverage this manipulation to bypass authorization checks within the application's delegate or data source methods, triggering actions they are not authorized to perform.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 2: Trigger Unintended Actions via Swipe through Direct Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_trigger_unintended_actions_via_swipe_through_direct_authorization_bypass.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker directly identifies and exploits logic flaws within the application's delegate or data source methods that handle swipe actions. This allows them to trigger actions without proper authorization, potentially leading to unintended data modification or other harmful consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 3: Access or Modify Sensitive Data via Swipe Actions through Insecure Data Handling and Leaks](./attack_tree_paths/path_3_access_or_modify_sensitive_data_via_swipe_actions_through_insecure_data_handling_and_leaks.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application insecurely handles sensitive data within the context of swipe actions. This could involve unintentionally leaking sensitive data as a side effect of a swipe action. For example, sensitive information might be briefly displayed or processed in a way that makes it accessible to an attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 4: Access or Modify Sensitive Data via Swipe Actions through Data Validation Bypass and Integrity Circumvention](./attack_tree_paths/path_4_access_or_modify_sensitive_data_via_swipe_actions_through_data_validation_bypass_and_integrit_878b9e31.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker bypasses the application's data validation mechanisms during a swipe operation. Following this, they are able to circumvent data integrity checks, allowing them to modify sensitive data in a way that goes undetected by the application's normal security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 5: Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Swipe Action Titles](./attack_tree_paths/path_5_exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_through_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_swipe_action_title_dbf19b47.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided content that is used to populate the titles of swipe action buttons. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into these titles. When another user interacts with the compromised swipe action, the injected script executes within their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
