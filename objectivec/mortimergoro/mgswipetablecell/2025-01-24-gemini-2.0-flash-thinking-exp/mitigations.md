## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Confirmation Dialog for Destructive Actions Triggered by `mgswipetablecell` Swipe Buttons](./mitigation_strategies/implement_confirmation_dialog_for_destructive_actions_triggered_by__mgswipetablecell__swipe_buttons.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When configuring `UIContextualAction` objects for destructive actions (like "Delete", "Remove", "Archive" if irreversible) within `mgswipetablecell`'s swipe action configuration:
        *   In the `handler` closure of the `UIContextualAction`, *before* executing the destructive action logic:
            *   Present an alert dialog to the user using `UIAlertController`.
            *   The dialog should clearly state the action associated with the `mgswipetablecell` button (e.g., "Delete Item?").
            *   Provide a confirmation action (e.g., "Delete", "Confirm") and a cancel action (e.g., "Cancel", "No") within the `UIAlertController`.
            *   Only execute the destructive action logic *within the confirmation action's handler* of the `UIAlertController`.
    2.  For developers: Ensure the confirmation dialog presentation and action execution are correctly nested within the `handler` of the `UIContextualAction` provided to `mgswipetablecell`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Accidental Data Loss (High Severity):** Users may unintentionally swipe and tap a destructive action button provided by `mgswipetablecell`, leading to irreversible data loss. This is mitigated by adding a confirmation step directly after the `mgswipetablecell` button tap.
        *   **Unintended Modification of Data (Medium Severity):** Accidental "Archive" or "Remove" actions (if they have significant consequences) triggered by `mgswipetablecell` buttons can disrupt user workflow. Confirmation reduces this risk.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Accidental Data Loss:** High Risk Reduction - Confirmation dialogs, implemented in conjunction with `mgswipetablecell` actions, significantly reduce accidental data loss by requiring explicit user confirmation after interacting with the swipe button.
        *   **Unintended Modification of Data:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces unintended modifications by adding a confirmation step after the `mgswipetablecell` button is tapped, although users can still confirm actions they didn't fully understand.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Currently implemented for the "Delete" action on items in the main task list view, which utilizes `mgswipetablecell` for swipe actions.
        *   Implemented in `TaskListViewController.swift` within the `tableView(_:trailingSwipeActionsConfigurationForRowAt:)` method, specifically in the `handler` of the "Delete" `UIContextualAction`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Missing for the "Archive" action in the task list view, which also uses `mgswipetablecell`. Currently, swiping to "Archive" immediately archives the task via `mgswipetablecell` without confirmation.
        *   Not implemented for other list views using `mgswipetablecell` where destructive actions are available, such as the "Project Settings" screen's "Remove User" swipe action provided by `mgswipetablecell`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Clear and Unambiguous Labels and Icons for `mgswipetablecell` Swipe Action Buttons](./mitigation_strategies/use_clear_and_unambiguous_labels_and_icons_for__mgswipetablecell__swipe_action_buttons.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When configuring `UIContextualAction` objects for `mgswipetablecell`:
        *   Carefully choose the `title` and `image` properties of each `UIContextualAction`.
        *   Ensure that the `title` (text label) and `image` (icon) for each `mgswipetablecell` swipe button are:
            *   **Descriptive:** Accurately represent the action performed when the `mgswipetablecell` button is tapped.
            *   **Unambiguous:** Minimize misinterpretation. Use standard icons and terminology where possible for `mgswipetablecell` actions.
            *   **Localized:** If the application is localized, ensure labels for `mgswipetablecell` actions are correctly translated and culturally appropriate.
    2.  For developers:  Prioritize clarity when setting the `title` and `image` of `UIContextualAction` objects used with `mgswipetablecell`. Test labels with users to ensure they understand the actions associated with `mgswipetablecell` swipe buttons.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **User Confusion Leading to Unintended Actions (Medium Severity):** If labels or icons on `mgswipetablecell` swipe buttons are unclear, users may misunderstand the action and trigger unintended operations via `mgswipetablecell`.
        *   **Accidental Triggering of Destructive Actions (Low to Medium Severity):** Clear labels on `mgswipetablecell` buttons reduce the likelihood of users accidentally triggering destructive actions if they misunderstand the button's purpose within the `mgswipetablecell` swipe interface.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **User Confusion Leading to Unintended Actions:** Medium Risk Reduction - Clear labels on `mgswipetablecell` buttons significantly reduce user confusion by making actions easily understandable within the swipe context.
        *   **Accidental Triggering of Destructive Actions:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Primarily a preventative measure, reducing the chance of users even considering a destructive action via `mgswipetablecell` if they clearly understand the button's purpose.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Generally implemented well for core actions like "Delete" (trash can icon, "Delete" text) and "Edit" (pencil icon, "Edit" text) in the task list, which are presented using `mgswipetablecell`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   In the "Project Settings" screen, the "Remove User" `mgswipetablecell` swipe action uses a generic "Remove" label. This could be improved to "Remove User" for better clarity within the `mgswipetablecell` swipe context.
        *   Review less frequently used `mgswipetablecell` swipe actions in secondary screens to ensure labels are descriptive and unambiguous.
