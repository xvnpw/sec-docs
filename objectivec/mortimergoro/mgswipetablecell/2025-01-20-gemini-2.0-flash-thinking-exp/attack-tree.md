## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Improper Action Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_action_handling.md)

*   Attack Vector: Trigger Malicious Action via Swipe (Critical Node)
    *   Description: An attacker manipulates the user interface or application state to trigger a swipe action that performs an unintended and harmful operation. This is possible when the application logic doesn't adequately control or validate the actions associated with swipe gestures.
    *   Contributing Factor: Application fails to validate action data. The application trusts the data associated with the swipe action without proper verification.
    *   Specific Technique: Inject malicious data into action parameters (High-Risk Step). The attacker crafts or modifies the data associated with the swipe action to achieve a malicious outcome.
        *   Example: Modifying a database record ID to delete or alter an unauthorized record.
        *   Example: Triggering a privileged function that should not be accessible through this action.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Delegate Method Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_delegate_method_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vector: Improper Input Sanitization in Delegate Methods (Critical Node)
    *   Description: The `mgswipetablecell` library passes data related to the swipe action to the application's delegate methods. If the application doesn't sanitize this input, it can lead to various vulnerabilities.
    *   Contributing Factor: Library passes user-controlled data to delegate methods without sanitization. The library itself doesn't perform sufficient sanitization, relying on the application to handle this.
    *   Specific Technique: Application's delegate methods are vulnerable to injection attacks (High-Risk Step). Malicious input passed through the delegate methods is interpreted as code or commands.
        *   Example: SQL injection if delegate method constructs database queries (Critical Node). If the delegate method uses the unsanitized input to build a SQL query, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code to access, modify, or delete database information.
