# Threat Model Analysis for mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Swipe Action Content](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_swipe_action_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker could repeatedly or strategically swipe on table view cells to reveal sensitive information displayed within the swipe action views (e.g., delete confirmation, edit options). The vulnerability lies in how the library renders and displays content within its swipeable elements.

**Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive user data, potentially leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or financial loss.

**Affected Component:** `MGSolidColorSwipeView`, `MGSwipeButton` (specifically the content rendering logic within these views).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid displaying highly sensitive data directly within swipe action views.
* Implement additional authorization checks before revealing sensitive information, ensuring the library's display mechanisms are not the sole point of access control.

## Threat: [UI Spoofing/Phishing via Customizable Swipe Elements](./threats/ui_spoofingphishing_via_customizable_swipe_elements.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage the customizable nature of swipe action views provided by the library to create deceptive UI elements that mimic legitimate system prompts or application interfaces. This exploits the library's flexibility in rendering custom content.

**Impact:** Theft of user credentials, sensitive personal information, or financial data through a deceptive interface rendered by the library.

**Affected Component:** `MGSolidColorSwipeView`, `MGSwipeButton` (customizable content and rendering capabilities provided by the library).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly control the content and design of swipe action views, avoiding elements that could be mistaken for system-level prompts.
* Implement checks to ensure the content being displayed in swipe actions originates from trusted sources and is not being manipulated.

## Threat: [Memory Leaks or Resource Exhaustion within the Library](./threats/memory_leaks_or_resource_exhaustion_within_the_library.md)

**Description:** Bugs or inefficiencies within the `mgswipetablecell` library itself could lead to memory leaks or excessive resource consumption over time. This is a vulnerability within the library's code.

**Impact:** Application performance degradation, crashes, or instability over prolonged use due to resource mismanagement within the library.

**Affected Component:** Internal memory management within `MGSwipeTableCell`, `MGSolidColorSwipeView`, and `MGSwipeButton`.

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Monitor application performance and memory usage when using the library.
* Stay updated with the latest versions of the library, as bug fixes and security patches may address such issues.
* If resource consumption becomes a significant problem, consider profiling the application to identify the source of the leaks and potentially explore alternative libraries.
