# Attack Surface Analysis for mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Manipulation of Swipe Actions](./attack_surfaces/client-side_manipulation_of_swipe_actions.md)

**Description:** Attackers can modify the JavaScript code or DOM structure to alter the intended behavior of swipe actions. This includes changing target URLs, manipulating function calls, or injecting malicious scripts into event handlers associated with swipe buttons.

**How `mgswipetablecell` Contributes:** The library provides the core mechanism for defining and triggering actions based on user swipes. If the application doesn't properly secure the handling of these actions, the library's functionality becomes a direct vector for manipulation. The library's event handling and DOM structure related to swipe actions are the points of interaction for such attacks.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the JavaScript to change the URL associated with a "Delete" swipe button to send sensitive user data to an attacker-controlled server instead of deleting the intended item. This leverages the library's event listeners attached to the swipe buttons.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data breaches, execution of malicious scripts on the client-side.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Server-Side):** Validate and sanitize any data used to construct the swipe action URLs or parameters *on the server-side* where the actions are processed.
* **Principle of Least Privilege (Server-Side):** Ensure swipe actions only trigger operations that the user is authorized to perform. Implement robust authorization checks on the server-side when handling the requests initiated by swipe actions.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts, limiting the impact of potential client-side manipulation.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Review the JavaScript code and DOM manipulation logic related to how the application handles the events triggered by `mgswipetablecell` for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Dynamically Rendered Cell Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_dynamically_rendered_cell_content.md)

**Description:** If the application dynamically renders content within the swipeable table cells without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute when a user interacts with the cell (e.g., during the swipe animation or when a swipe button is revealed).

**How `mgswipetablecell` Contributes:** The library is directly responsible for rendering the content within the table cells, including any custom elements or data provided by the application. If the application passes unsanitized data, `mgswipetablecell` will display it, making the library a direct conduit for the XSS vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker injects a `<script>` tag into a user's profile name, which is then displayed within a swipeable cell rendered by `mgswipetablecell`. When another user swipes on that cell, the malicious script executes in their browser due to the library displaying the unsanitized content.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Always encode or escape user-provided data *before* passing it to `mgswipetablecell` for rendering. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript strings).
* **Templating Engines with Auto-Escaping:** Utilize templating engines that offer automatic output escaping by default when rendering data within the swipeable cells.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks, even if they occur due to a failure in sanitization.
