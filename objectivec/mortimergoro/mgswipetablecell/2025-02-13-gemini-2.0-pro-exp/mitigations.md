## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation within Button Actions Triggered by MGSwipeTableCell](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_within_button_actions_triggered_by_mgswipetablecell.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Locate `MGSwipeTableCellDelegate` Implementations:** Find all instances where your code implements the `MGSwipeTableCellDelegate` protocol, specifically the `swipeTableCell(_:tappedButtonAt:direction:fromExpansion:)` method. This is where button tap actions are handled.
2.  **Identify Data Used in Actions:** Within each implementation of this delegate method, identify *all* data used within the button action handlers. This includes data:
    *   Passed directly from the `MGSwipeTableCell` (e.g., the `cell` itself, the `index` of the tapped button).
    *   Retrieved from the cell's content (e.g., labels, text fields *within* the `MGSwipeTableCell`).
    *   Derived from the `indexPath` (e.g., fetching data from your data model based on the cell's row).
3.  **Implement Data-Specific Validation:** Before using *any* of this data, implement rigorous validation checks based on the data type and expected format:
    *   **Type Safety:** Use Swift's type system (`guard let`, optional chaining) to ensure data is of the expected type.
    *   **Range/Length Checks:** Validate numeric ranges and string lengths.
    *   **Format Validation:** Use regular expressions (carefully!) or built-in methods (like `URLComponents`) to validate formats (emails, URLs, etc.).
    *   **Whitelist Characters:** For strings, consider a whitelist of allowed characters.
4.  **Handle Validation Failures:** If validation fails:
    *   *Do not* proceed with the button's intended action.
    *   Display a user-friendly error (if appropriate).
    *   Log the error.
    *   Return `false` from the `swipeTableCell(...)` delegate method to prevent any default behavior.
5. **Parameterized Queries (If Applicable):** If a button action interacts with a database, *always* use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.  This is crucial even if the data seems "safe" â€“ it might be manipulated before reaching this point.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):**  Directly mitigated if button actions use unvalidated cell data in database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):**  Mitigated if unvalidated cell data is displayed in a `UIWebView`/`WKWebView` as a result of a button action.
*   **Command Injection (Severity: High):** Mitigated if unvalidated cell data is used to construct shell commands.
*   **Data Corruption/Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Medium to High):** Mitigated by ensuring data conforms to expected formats before use in *any* operation triggered by the button.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Partially mitigated by limiting input sizes (e.g., string lengths).

**Impact:**
*   Reduces the risk of all listed threats significantly, directly addressing vulnerabilities arising from how `MGSwipeTableCell`'s button actions handle data.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - *Fill in based on your project*)
*   Basic type checking in `MyViewController.swift` within the `swipeTableCell(...)` delegate method.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - *Fill in based on your project*)
*   Missing format validation (regex) for email addresses.
*   Missing length checks for text inputs within the cell.
*   No input validation before network requests initiated by button actions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Delegate and Callback Handling within MGSwipeTableCell Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_delegate_and_callback_handling_within_mgswipetablecell_interactions.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review `MGSwipeTableCellDelegate` Usage:** Examine all implementations of the `MGSwipeTableCellDelegate` protocol.
2.  **Prevent Retain Cycles:**
    *   Ensure the delegate property in your `MGSwipeTableCell` subclass is declared as `weak`.
    *   Use `[weak self]` or `[unowned self]` in any closures used as callbacks *within* the cell or its delegate methods, especially if those closures reference `self`.
3.  **Handle Optionals Safely:**  Within delegate methods (like `swipeTableCell(...)`), always check for `nil` values when accessing data passed from the cell. Use `guard let` or optional chaining.
4.  **Avoid Blocking Operations *in the Delegate*:** Do *not* perform long-running operations directly within the `MGSwipeTableCellDelegate` methods.  These methods are called on the main thread.
    *   Dispatch long tasks (network requests, etc.) to a background queue using `DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async`.
    *   Ensure UI updates resulting from background tasks are dispatched back to the main thread using `DispatchQueue.main.async`.
5. **Error Handling in Delegate Methods:** Implement robust error handling within the `swipeTableCell(...)` method and any other custom delegate methods you've defined related to `MGSwipeTableCell`.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Memory Leaks (Severity: Medium):**  Retain cycles involving the cell and its delegate can prevent deallocation.
*   **Crashes (Severity: High):**  Accessing `nil` values or performing UI updates on a background thread can cause crashes.
*   **UI Unresponsiveness (Severity: Medium):**  Blocking the main thread within delegate methods makes the UI unresponsive.
*   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Incorrect delegate implementation can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact:**
*   Directly addresses risks related to the lifecycle and responsiveness of `MGSwipeTableCell` and its interactions with your code.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - *Fill in based on your project*)
*   `weak` delegate property is used in `MyCustomCell.swift`.
*   Some optional chaining is used in `MyViewController.swift`.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - *Fill in based on your project*)
*   `[weak self]` is not consistently used in closures within the cell.
*   Error handling is missing in some delegate methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Animation and Performance Monitoring of MGSwipeTableCell](./mitigation_strategies/animation_and_performance_monitoring_of_mgswipetablecell.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Profile with Instruments:** Use Xcode's Instruments (specifically the Time Profiler and Allocations instruments) to profile your application.
2.  **Focus on Swipe Interactions:** While profiling, *specifically* focus on the performance of `MGSwipeTableCell` during swipe gestures and button reveals. Perform repeated swipes and button taps.
3.  **Identify Bottlenecks:** Look for:
    *   High CPU usage during swipe animations.
    *   Memory allocations that occur repeatedly during swipes and don't get released.
    *   Long method calls within the `MGSwipeTableCell` code itself (you can examine the call tree in Instruments).
4.  **Investigate and Optimize:** If you find performance issues:
    *   Examine the `MGSwipeTableCell` code (if possible) to understand the cause.
    *   Check your own code that configures the cell and its buttons for any inefficiencies.
    *   Consider simplifying the animations or button configurations if they are overly complex.
5. **Address Memory Leaks:** If Instruments reveals memory leaks related to `MGSwipeTableCell`, investigate the retain cycles or other memory management issues causing them.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Excessive Animation (Severity: Medium):**  Poorly optimized animations or internal bugs in `MGSwipeTableCell` can lead to excessive CPU usage, making the app unresponsive.

**Impact:**
*   Directly addresses performance issues specifically caused by `MGSwipeTableCell`, improving responsiveness and preventing potential DoS.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - *Fill in based on your project*)
*   No specific performance monitoring of `MGSwipeTableCell` is in place.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - *Fill in based on your project*)
*   No targeted profiling with Instruments focused on swipe actions.
*   No procedures for investigating performance issues related to the library.
