# Threat Model Analysis for mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell

## Threat: [Unauthorized Action Execution via Delegate Hijacking](./threats/unauthorized_action_execution_via_delegate_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a separate vulnerability (e.g., a memory corruption bug, or a flaw *within* how `MGSwipeTableCell` manages its delegate internally) to gain control of the application's memory. They then modify the `MGSwipeTableCell`'s `delegate` pointer or the internal data structures used by the library to manage delegates, causing it to point to a malicious object or function. When a swipe action is triggered, the attacker's code is executed instead of the intended handler. *This differs from the previous version by focusing on potential vulnerabilities within MGSwipeTableCell's delegate handling itself, rather than just the application's use of the delegate.*
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the application, potentially leading to data theft, data modification, privilege escalation, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `delegate` property of `MGSwipeTableCell`, and *internal* mechanisms within `MGSwipeTableCell` related to how the delegate is stored, accessed, and used. This could include any internal data structures or methods used to manage the delegate and dispatch events.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Internal Code Review (for MGSwipeTableCell developers):** Thoroughly review the `MGSwipeTableCell` codebase, specifically focusing on the delegate handling mechanisms. Look for potential memory corruption vulnerabilities, race conditions, or other flaws that could allow an attacker to manipulate the delegate or its associated data.
        *   **Memory Safety (for MGSwipeTableCell developers):** If possible, use memory-safe techniques or languages to minimize the risk of memory corruption vulnerabilities.
        *   **Robust Delegate Validation (for MGSwipeTableCell developers):** Implement strong validation checks within `MGSwipeTableCell` to ensure that the delegate object is valid and conforms to the expected protocol *before* it is used. This should include checks to prevent the execution of malicious code if the delegate has been tampered with.
        *   **Application-Level Hardening:** While this threat focuses on the library, application developers should still practice defense-in-depth. Address any *application-level* memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to attack the library.
        *   **Regular Library Updates:** Application developers should keep `MGSwipeTableCell` updated to the latest version to benefit from any security fixes or improvements related to delegate handling.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Swipe Events](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_swipe_events.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker repeatedly and rapidly swipes cells, triggering a flood of events. This exploits the gesture recognition and event handling *within* `MGSwipeTableCell`. The attacker aims to overwhelm the application's main thread by causing `MGSwipeTableCell` to process an excessive number of swipe events and animations. The core vulnerability lies in how efficiently `MGSwipeTableCell` handles rapid, repeated gesture events.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, potentially crashing. While the backend might be involved *if* the app's delegate triggers network calls, the *primary* impact here is on the application's UI thread due to `MGSwipeTableCell`'s processing.
    *   **Affected Component:** `MGSwipeTableCell`'s gesture recognizers (specifically, the pan gesture recognizer that detects swipes) and the internal event handling mechanisms that process these gestures and trigger delegate calls. This includes methods like `handlePan:` (or similar, depending on the internal naming) and any methods involved in animating the swipe actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Internal Rate Limiting (for MGSwipeTableCell developers):** Implement rate limiting *within* `MGSwipeTableCell` itself to limit the frequency of swipe event processing. This could involve ignoring rapid, successive swipe events within a short time window or using a debouncing technique to prevent multiple rapid triggers of the same internal animation or delegate call.
        *   **Optimized Gesture Handling (for MGSwipeTableCell developers):** Optimize the gesture recognizer and event handling code within `MGSwipeTableCell` to minimize the overhead of processing swipe events. This could involve using efficient algorithms and data structures, and avoiding unnecessary computations or UI updates.
        *   **Asynchronous Animation Handling (Consideration for MGSwipeTableCell developers):** Explore options for handling some aspects of the swipe animations asynchronously, if feasible, to reduce the load on the main thread. This would require careful design to avoid visual glitches or inconsistencies.
        *   **Application-Level Mitigation (Defense in Depth):** Application developers should still implement rate limiting and asynchronous operations in their *own* delegate handlers, as described in previous responses. This provides an additional layer of defense.
