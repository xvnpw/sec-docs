# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.a.i.1. Craft Malformed Input [HR] (mgswipetablecell)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Craft Malformed Input" step within the broader attack tree, specifically targeting vulnerabilities related to how the `mgswipetablecell` library handles delegate parameters.  We aim to identify potential attack vectors, assess the feasibility and impact of exploiting this step, and propose mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to prevent attackers from successfully crafting malicious input that could compromise the application using this library.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the `1.a.i.1. Craft Malformed Input [HR]` node of the attack tree.  The scope includes:

*   **Target Library:** `https://github.com/mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell`
*   **Vulnerability Area:**  Improper handling of delegate parameters, leading to potential vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), code injection, or denial-of-service.  We are *not* analyzing the entire library's security posture, only the aspects relevant to this specific attack path.
*   **Input Types:**  We will consider various input types that could be passed to delegate methods, including strings, numbers, objects, and potentially even closures (depending on how the library uses delegates).
*   **Delegate Methods:** We will examine the delegate methods provided by `mgswipetablecell` that accept user-controllable input, focusing on how that input is processed and used.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis does *not* cover vulnerabilities in other parts of the application or in unrelated libraries.  It also does not cover network-level attacks or social engineering.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a static analysis of the `mgswipetablecell` source code, focusing on:
    *   Delegate method signatures and implementations.
    *   How delegate parameters are used (e.g., displayed directly, used in calculations, passed to other functions).
    *   Any existing input validation or sanitization mechanisms.
    *   Any use of potentially dangerous functions (e.g., `eval`, `innerHTML` in a web context, or functions that execute system commands).

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (if feasible):**  If possible, we will set up a test environment and attempt to craft malicious inputs to trigger vulnerabilities.  This will involve:
    *   Creating a simple application that uses `mgswipetablecell`.
    *   Using debugging tools to inspect the flow of data and identify potential injection points.
    *   Attempting to inject various payloads (e.g., XSS payloads, code injection payloads).

3.  **Vulnerability Identification:** Based on the code review and dynamic analysis, we will identify specific vulnerabilities and classify them based on their type (e.g., XSS, code injection) and severity.

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  For each identified vulnerability, we will propose specific mitigation strategies, including code changes, configuration changes, and best practices.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.a.i.1. Craft Malformed Input [HR]

**4.1. Context and Assumptions**

*   **Attack Tree Context:** This step is part of a larger attack tree, likely targeting a vulnerability in how `mgswipetablecell` handles user-provided data through its delegate methods.  The preceding steps likely involve identifying the vulnerable delegate methods and understanding their expected input format.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** We assume the attacker has the ability to interact with the application and provide input to the `mgswipetablecell` components, likely through a user interface.
*   **Vulnerability Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that a vulnerability exists where a delegate method does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it, potentially leading to XSS, code injection, or other injection-based attacks.

**4.2. Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Access to Source Code)**

Since we don't have the *exact* code implementation details at this moment, we'll make some educated guesses based on common patterns in iOS development and how swipeable table cells typically work.  This section would be *significantly* more detailed with the actual source code.

*   **Potential Delegate Methods:**  `mgswipetablecell` likely has delegate methods like:
    *   `swipeTableCell:didTriggerLeftButtonWithIndex:`
    *   `swipeTableCell:didTriggerRightButtonWithIndex:`
    *   `swipeTableCell:tappedButtonAtIndex:withSender:withData:` (This is a *likely* candidate for vulnerabilities if `withData:` accepts arbitrary data).
    *   `swipeTableCell:shouldHideSwipeOnTap:`

*   **Potential Vulnerability Points:**
    *   **`withData:` Parameter:** If a delegate method accepts a `withData:` parameter (or similar) that allows the application to pass arbitrary data associated with a button, this is a *prime* target.  If the library doesn't sanitize this data before using it (e.g., displaying it in a label, using it in a URL, etc.), it's vulnerable.
    *   **Button Titles/Labels:** If the button titles themselves are customizable and passed through a delegate, and the library doesn't escape them properly before rendering, this could lead to XSS.
    *   **Index Values:** While less likely, if index values are used in a way that directly influences code execution (e.g., used as an index into an array without bounds checking), it could lead to a denial-of-service or other issues.

*   **Example (Hypothetical Vulnerable Code):**

    ```swift
    // In mgswipetablecell (VULNERABLE)
    func swipeTableCell(_ cell: MGSwipeTableCell, tappedButtonAtIndex index: Int, withSender sender: Any?, withData data: Any?) {
        if let dataString = data as? String {
            // DANGEROUS: Directly displaying user-provided data without sanitization.
            someLabel.text = dataString
        }
    }

    // In the application using mgswipetablecell
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "MyCell", for: indexPath) as! MGSwipeTableCell
        cell.delegate = self

        let maliciousData = "<script>alert('XSS');</script>"
        let rightButton = MGSwipeButton(title: "Delete", backgroundColor: .red, callback: {
            (sender: MGSwipeTableCell) -> Bool in
            return true
        })
        rightButton.data = maliciousData // Attacker controls this!
        cell.rightButtons = [rightButton]

        return cell
    }
    ```

    In this *hypothetical* example, the attacker could inject JavaScript code through the `data` property of the `MGSwipeButton`.  If the `mgswipetablecell` library doesn't sanitize this data before displaying it (e.g., in a label), the JavaScript code would execute, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**4.3. Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical - Requires Test Environment)**

1.  **Setup:** Create a simple iOS application that uses `mgswipetablecell` and implements a delegate method that accepts a `withData:` parameter (or similar).
2.  **Payload Injection:**
    *   **XSS Payload:**  Try injecting a basic XSS payload like `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` into the `withData:` parameter.  Observe if the alert box appears.  Try more complex payloads, including those that attempt to steal cookies or redirect the user.
    *   **HTML Injection:** Try injecting HTML tags like `<b>`, `<i>`, `<img>` to see if they are rendered.  This can indicate a lack of HTML escaping.
    *   **Code Injection (Less Likely):**  If the delegate parameter is used in a way that could influence code execution (e.g., passed to an `eval` function or used to construct a file path), try injecting code snippets to see if they are executed.
    *   **Denial-of-Service:** Try injecting very large strings or specially crafted data that might cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.
3.  **Debugging:** Use Xcode's debugger to step through the code and observe how the injected data is handled.  Pay close attention to any points where the data is displayed, used in calculations, or passed to other functions.

**4.4. Vulnerability Identification (Hypothetical)**

Based on the hypothetical code review and dynamic analysis, we might identify the following vulnerabilities:

*   **Vulnerability 1: Stored XSS via `withData:` Parameter:**  The `swipeTableCell:tappedButtonAtIndex:withSender:withData:` delegate method is vulnerable to Stored XSS because it does not sanitize the `withData:` parameter before displaying it.  This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed whenever the cell is displayed.  (Severity: High)
*   **Vulnerability 2: HTML Injection via Button Titles:**  If button titles are customizable and passed through a delegate without proper escaping, an attacker could inject HTML tags, potentially leading to phishing attacks or defacement. (Severity: Medium)
*   **Vulnerability 3: Denial of Service:** Passing extremely large string to delegate can lead to application crash. (Severity: Medium)

**4.5. Mitigation Recommendations**

*   **Mitigation for Vulnerability 1 (Stored XSS):**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Implement robust input sanitization to remove or encode any potentially dangerous characters from the `withData:` parameter *before* using it.  Use a well-vetted HTML sanitization library (like those available via Swift Package Manager) rather than attempting to write your own.  A whitelist approach (allowing only specific safe characters) is generally preferred over a blacklist approach.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Even with input sanitization, it's good practice to HTML-encode the data *before* displaying it in a label or other UI element.  This ensures that any remaining special characters are treated as text rather than code.  Swift's built-in string handling can often handle this, but be sure to test thoroughly.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (If applicable):** If the application uses a web view, implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.  This can help mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Mitigation for Vulnerability 2 (HTML Injection):**
    *   **HTML Encoding:**  Always HTML-encode button titles before displaying them.  This will prevent any injected HTML tags from being rendered.

*   **Mitigation for Vulnerability 3 (Denial of Service):**
    *   **Input validation:** Implement input length.

*   **General Recommendations:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that delegate methods only have access to the data they absolutely need.  Avoid passing unnecessary data.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Testing:**  Perform regular security testing, including penetration testing and fuzzing, to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed during code reviews.
    *   **Stay Updated:**  Keep the `mgswipetablecell` library and all other dependencies up to date to ensure that you have the latest security patches.
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding best practices.
