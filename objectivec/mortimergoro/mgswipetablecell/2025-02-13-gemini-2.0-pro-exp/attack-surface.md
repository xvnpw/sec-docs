# Attack Surface Analysis for mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation and Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_and_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  The application fails to properly validate or sanitize data used within the callback functions triggered by swipe actions on table cells.  This is the most critical area because `mgswipetablecell` *directly facilitates* the execution of this potentially vulnerable code.
*   **mgswipetablecell Contribution:**  The library provides the mechanism (swipe buttons and callbacks) where user-provided or cell-derived data is processed. The library's *core functionality* is to execute developer-provided code in response to user interaction.
*   **Example:**  A cell displays a user-provided comment.  A swipe button triggers a callback that uses this comment directly in a SQL query: `db.execute("DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment = '" + cell.commentText + "'")`.  If `cell.commentText` is `'; DROP TABLE comments; --`, the entire comments table is deleted.  This is a *direct* consequence of how `mgswipetablecell` is used.
*   **Impact:**  Data corruption, data loss, unauthorized data access, potentially remote code execution (depending on the injection type).
*   **Risk Severity:**  High to Critical (depending on the context and data handled).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation within callback blocks. Use parameterized queries (e.g., `db.execute("DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment = ?", cell.commentText)`) for *all* database interactions.  Escape/encode data appropriately for network requests and UI display.  Use whitelisting of allowed values where possible.  Avoid string concatenation for building queries or commands. This is *paramount* for any code executed within the `mgswipetablecell` callbacks.
    *   **User:** (No direct mitigation; relies entirely on the developer's secure coding practices).

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Memory Exhaustion (related to callback actions)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_memory_exhaustion__related_to_callback_actions_.md)

*   **Description:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive memory consumption *specifically triggered by actions within mgswipetablecell callbacks*. This differs from general memory leaks; it's about the *actions* the library enables.
*   **mgswipetablecell Contribution:** The library's callbacks provide a mechanism to execute potentially resource-intensive operations in response to user swipes. If these operations are not carefully managed, they can lead to DoS.
*   **Example:** A swipe button triggers a callback that downloads a large file from a URL provided in the cell's data. An attacker could populate the table with many cells, each referencing a very large file.  Repeatedly swiping and triggering these downloads could exhaust memory or network resources, leading to a DoS.  This is a direct result of the callback functionality provided by `mgswipetablecell`.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, unavailability of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if callbacks can trigger resource-intensive operations).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement rate limiting or throttling *within* the callback functions.  Limit the size of data that can be processed or downloaded within a callback.  Use asynchronous operations and background queues to prevent blocking the main thread.  Carefully manage memory allocation and deallocation within the callbacks. Avoid performing any long-running or blocking operations directly within the callback.
    *   **User:** (Limited direct mitigation; relies on developer implementation).

## Attack Surface: [UI Manipulation / Phishing (Direct Vulnerability in Library)](./attack_surfaces/ui_manipulation__phishing__direct_vulnerability_in_library_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability *within mgswipetablecell itself* allows an attacker to manipulate the appearance or behavior of swipe buttons, bypassing the developer's intended configuration. This is distinct from the developer misusing the library; it's about a flaw *in the library's code*.
    *   **mgswipetablecell Contribution:** If the library has vulnerabilities in its rendering or event handling logic, it could be directly exploited to alter button appearance or redirect actions.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in `mgswipetablecell` allows an attacker to inject CSS (if it uses web views internally) or manipulate native UI elements to change the text of a "Delete" button to "Save," even if the developer correctly configured it as "Delete." This is a *direct* vulnerability in the library.
    *   **Impact:** Unintended data modification, data loss, potentially account compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if such a vulnerability exists).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** This is difficult to mitigate directly if the vulnerability is in the library itself. The best approach is to:
            *   **Use a well-maintained and actively developed library:** Check the library's GitHub repository for recent activity, issue reports, and security advisories.
            *   **Perform a security audit of the library's code (if feasible):** This is a more advanced step, but if the application is highly sensitive, it might be necessary.
            *   **Report any suspected vulnerabilities to the library maintainers:** Contribute to the security of the open-source project.
            * **Consider alternative libraries:** If a serious vulnerability is found and not patched promptly, consider switching to a more secure alternative.
        *   **User:** (No direct mitigation; relies on the developer choosing a secure library and keeping it updated). Keep the application updated.
