# Attack Surface Analysis for mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Action Handlers (Input Validation)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_action_handlers__input_validation_.md)

Description: Swipe action handlers, which are application-defined code executed when a swipe action is triggered, may process user input without proper validation, leading to vulnerabilities.

How `mgswipetablecell` Contributes: `mgswipetablecell` triggers application-defined action handlers. The library's functionality directly enables the execution of these handlers based on user swipes. If the *application* fails to validate input within these handlers, the swipe action mechanism provided by `mgswipetablecell` becomes a pathway for exploitation.

Example: A "Delete" swipe action handler takes the cell's data (e.g., user ID) and directly uses it in a database query without validation. An attacker could manipulate the cell data (if possible through other vulnerabilities) to inject SQL into the delete query, potentially deleting unintended data or gaining unauthorized access. The ease of triggering this action via `mgswipetablecell`'s swipe gesture increases the attack surface.

Impact: High - Could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service depending on the action handler's functionality and the vulnerability exploited.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation within all swipe action handlers. Validate all data received from the cell or user input before processing it. Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent injection attacks in database interactions. Apply appropriate encoding and sanitization for other types of input processing.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Action Handlers (Privilege Escalation)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_action_handlers__privilege_escalation_.md)

Description: Swipe action handlers might perform actions requiring elevated privileges without proper authorization checks, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized operations.

How `mgswipetablecell` Contributes: `mgswipetablecell` triggers action handlers. The library provides a user-friendly way to initiate actions. If the *application* lacks proper authorization checks within these handlers, the swipe mechanism of `mgswipetablecell` facilitates the exploitation of privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

Example: A swipe action handler for "Admin Delete" might be accessible to regular users due to a lack of proper role-based access control within the handler. A regular user could exploit this to delete administrative data or perform other admin-level actions by triggering the swipe action provided by `mgswipetablecell`.

Impact: Critical - Could lead to complete compromise of the application's data and functionality, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, and significant damage to the application and its users.

Risk Severity: Critical

Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Developers:** Implement strict authorization checks within all swipe action handlers, especially those performing privileged operations. Verify user roles and permissions before executing sensitive actions. Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Surface: [Over-Reliance on Library Security (False Sense of Security)](./attack_surfaces/over-reliance_on_library_security__false_sense_of_security_.md)

Description: Developers might mistakenly believe that `mgswipetablecell` provides inherent security features beyond its UI functionality, leading to a false sense of security and neglecting necessary application-level security measures.

How `mgswipetablecell` Contributes:  The ease of use and polished UI provided by `mgswipetablecell` might inadvertently lead developers to focus on the UI aspect and overlook the underlying security implications of the actions triggered by the swipe gestures. This can create a false sense of security, where developers assume the library handles more than it actually does in terms of security.

Example: Developers might assume that `mgswipetablecell` automatically secures the actions triggered by swipes, neglecting to implement proper authorization or input validation in their action handlers. The library itself is secure in its UI rendering, but it doesn't enforce security on the *actions* the application defines and executes.

Impact: High - Could lead to various vulnerabilities if developers fail to implement necessary security measures at the application level, assuming the library provides security that it doesn't.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Developers:** Understand the security boundaries of `mgswipetablecell`. Recognize that it is primarily a UI component and does not provide application-level security. Implement all necessary security measures (authorization, input validation, secure data handling) within the application code, especially in swipe action handlers. Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
