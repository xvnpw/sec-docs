# Threat Model Analysis for mortimergoro/mgswipetablecell

## Threat: [Unintended Action Execution due to Swipe Sensitivity](./threats/unintended_action_execution_due_to_swipe_sensitivity.md)

* **Description:**  If `mgswipetablecell`'s swipe gesture recognition is overly sensitive and not sufficiently configurable, users may unintentionally trigger swipe actions when attempting to scroll or interact with other UI elements. This is due to the library's default or poorly configured gesture sensitivity.
    * **Impact:** Accidental data deletion (e.g., deleting a critical record), unintended modification of application state leading to data corruption or incorrect application behavior, triggering unwanted actions with significant consequences depending on the application's functionality (e.g., unintended financial transactions, irreversible actions). In scenarios involving sensitive data or critical operations, this impact can be considered *high*.
    * **Affected Component:** Gesture Recognition module within `mgswipetablecell`, specifically the swipe threshold and sensitivity settings, and the configuration options exposed (or not exposed) by the library to developers.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (in applications handling critical data or actions).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**  If configurable, carefully adjust the swipe sensitivity and thresholds provided by `mgswipetablecell` to minimize accidental triggers. If the library offers limited configuration, consider forking and modifying the library to increase the default swipe threshold or provide more granular sensitivity controls. Thoroughly test swipe behavior in the application to ensure it is intuitive and avoids accidental actions, especially in critical workflows. Provide clear visual feedback and confirmation steps for destructive or irreversible swipe actions to mitigate the impact of accidental triggers.

## Threat: [State Confusion and Race Conditions in Action Execution](./threats/state_confusion_and_race_conditions_in_action_execution.md)

* **Description:** If `mgswipetablecell`'s internal implementation of action handling or state management is not thread-safe, rapid or concurrent swipe actions could lead to race conditions. This can result in actions being executed in an incorrect order, data corruption within the library's internal state, or inconsistent behavior when multiple swipe gestures are performed quickly. This is a potential vulnerability within the library's code itself.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption within the application if the library's state inconsistencies propagate to application data, application crashes or unexpected behavior due to corrupted internal state, incorrect action execution leading to unintended and potentially harmful consequences, denial of service if race conditions lead to deadlocks or resource exhaustion within the library. The impact can be *high* if it leads to data integrity issues or application instability in critical operations.
    * **Affected Component:** Action Execution and State Management modules within `mgswipetablecell`. Specifically, the code responsible for managing swipe action states, handling concurrent gestures, and executing associated actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High. Race conditions can be difficult to detect and debug, and can lead to unpredictable and potentially severe consequences, especially in multithreaded environments.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**  Review the source code of `mgswipetablecell` (if possible) to assess its thread safety and concurrency handling. If the library is not actively maintained or its thread safety is questionable, consider forking and implementing proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., using locks, GCD queues) within the library's action handling and state management logic.  Thoroughly test the application under heavy swipe action load and concurrent gesture scenarios to identify and address potential race conditions. If possible, contribute fixes back to the original library or consider using alternative, more robust swipeable table cell libraries if thread safety is a critical concern.
