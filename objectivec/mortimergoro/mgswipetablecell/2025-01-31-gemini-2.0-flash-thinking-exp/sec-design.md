# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is an open-source Swift library named `mgswipetablecell`. It provides a custom `UITableViewCell` subclass that enables swipeable actions, enhancing user interaction in iOS applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a reusable and easy-to-integrate component for iOS developers to add swipe actions to table view cells.
  - Improve user experience in iOS applications by enabling intuitive swipe-based interactions.
  - Offer a well-documented and maintained open-source library for the iOS development community.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Code quality and stability: Bugs or crashes in the library could negatively impact applications using it, leading to poor user experience and potential application instability.
  - Security vulnerabilities: Security flaws in the library could be exploited by malicious actors if the library is used in applications handling sensitive data (although the library itself is UI focused and unlikely to directly handle sensitive data).
  - Maintainability and updates: Lack of maintenance or timely updates could lead to the library becoming outdated or incompatible with newer iOS versions, reducing its usefulness and potentially introducing security issues due to outdated dependencies.
  - Adoption and community support: Low adoption rates or lack of community support could hinder the library's growth and long-term viability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community code review and potential security audits. (Implemented: Open-source model)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or dedicated security resources for this open-source project.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for dependencies to introduce vulnerabilities (though this project appears to have minimal external dependencies).

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement basic static code analysis (SAST) using freely available tools to identify potential code quality and security issues.
  - security control: Regularly check for dependency updates and known vulnerabilities in any external libraries used (though currently minimal).
  - security control: Encourage community contributions and code reviews, specifically focusing on security aspects.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation on how to use the library securely, highlighting any potential security considerations for developers integrating it into their applications.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. This library is a UI component and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. This library does not handle user authorization.
  - Input Validation: While the library primarily receives programmatic inputs (API calls), ensure proper validation of any input parameters to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. Focus on validating data passed to public methods and properties.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. This library does not require cryptographic operations as it is a UI component and does not handle sensitive data directly. However, applications using this library might handle sensitive data and should implement appropriate cryptography measures at the application level, outside the scope of this library.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment for a library like `mgswipetablecell` is about how it's made available to developers, not about deploying a running instance of the library itself. Developers integrate it into their applications, which are then deployed to end-user devices.

Deployment Options for Library Distribution:
1. Swift Package Manager (SPM): Distribute the library as a Swift package.
2. CocoaPods: Distribute the library as a CocoaPod.
3. Carthage (less common now): Distribute the library via Carthage.
4. Manual Integration: Developers download source code and manually integrate.

We will focus on Swift Package Manager as a modern and recommended approach.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes We Are Trying to Protect:
  - For the `mgswipetablecell` library itself, there isn't a direct critical business process. Its value lies in providing a useful component to other applications.
  - For applications using this library, the critical business processes are application-specific. The library should not negatively impact these processes by introducing bugs or security vulnerabilities.

- Data We Are Trying to Protect and Their Sensitivity:
  - The `mgswipetablecell` library itself does not directly handle or store sensitive data.
  - Applications using this library may handle sensitive data. The library should be designed and implemented to avoid unintentionally exposing or compromising data handled by the applications using it. The sensitivity of data depends entirely on the applications integrating this library.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any specific performance requirements for the swipeable table view cell functionality?
  - Are there any known compatibility issues with specific iOS versions or device types?
  - Is there a roadmap for future features or enhancements for the library?
  - Are there any specific security concerns that have been raised or considered during the development of this library?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a useful and well-maintained open-source UI library for the iOS community. Adoption and positive community feedback are key success metrics.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important but balanced with the nature of an open-source UI library. Focus is on preventing common vulnerabilities and ensuring the library doesn't introduce security risks into applications using it. Formal security audits are not assumed for this project at this stage.
  - DESIGN: The library is designed as a modular UI component with minimal external dependencies, focusing on ease of integration and usability within iOS applications. Deployment is primarily through Swift Package Manager for ease of distribution and integration.
