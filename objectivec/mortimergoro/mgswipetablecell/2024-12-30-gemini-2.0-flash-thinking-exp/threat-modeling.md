Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the `MGSwipeTableCell` library:

*   **Threat: Malicious Action Injection**
    *   Description: An attacker could manipulate the data used to define swipe actions (e.g., titles, action handlers, API endpoints) if this data originates from an untrusted source or user input is not properly sanitized. This directly impacts how `MGSwipeTableCell` is configured, leading to the execution of unintended or harmful actions when a user swipes on a cell. For example, an attacker could inject a delete action for a different resource or an action that sends sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   Impact: Data loss, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary code depending on the injected action.
    *   Affected Component: Action Definition/Configuration (specifically how the `rightButtons` and `leftButtons` arrays are populated and how their actions are defined within `MGSwipeTableCell`).
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Always sanitize and validate any user-provided input used to define swipe actions.
        *   Avoid dynamically constructing swipe actions based on untrusted data.
        *   Use server-side logic to determine available actions based on user roles and permissions, rather than relying solely on client-side configuration within `MGSwipeTableCell`.
        *   Implement strong input validation on the server-side for any data used to configure swipe actions that will be reflected in `MGSwipeTableCell`.

*   **Threat: Insufficient Authorization Checks within Swipe Actions**
    *   Description: The code executed when a swipe action is triggered *via* `MGSwipeTableCell` might not perform adequate authorization checks to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to perform that action. An attacker could exploit the ease of triggering actions through the swipe interface provided by `MGSwipeTableCell` to bypass traditional authorization flows. For example, a swipe action to "Promote to Admin" might not verify the current user's administrative privileges before executing the promotion logic.
    *   Impact: Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to resources, or unintended modification of data.
    *   Affected Component: Action Handlers (the code blocks or functions executed when a swipe action is triggered *through* `MGSwipeTableCell`).
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Always perform server-side authorization checks before executing any sensitive action triggered by a swipe initiated by `MGSwipeTableCell`.
        *   Do not rely solely on the client-side configuration of `MGSwipeTableCell` to enforce authorization.
        *   Ensure that the backend API endpoints called by swipe actions initiated by `MGSwipeTableCell` enforce proper authentication and authorization.
