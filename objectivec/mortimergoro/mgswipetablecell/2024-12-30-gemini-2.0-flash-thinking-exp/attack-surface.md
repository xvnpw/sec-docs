Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `MGSwipeTableCell` with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Malicious Button Actions**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the actions performed when `MGSwipeTableCell`'s swipe buttons are triggered.
    *   **How MGSwipeTableCell Contributes:** `MGSwipeTableCell` provides the mechanism to define and trigger custom actions associated with its swipe buttons. The security of these actions is entirely dependent on the developer's implementation.
    *   **Example:** A "Delete" button action, configured within `MGSwipeTableCell`, directly deletes a user's account from the database without requiring confirmation or proper authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation if the action performs sensitive operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust authorization and authentication checks within the button action handlers defined for `MGSwipeTableCell`. Always validate user intent and permissions before performing sensitive operations. Use confirmation dialogs for destructive actions triggered by `MGSwipeTableCell` buttons. Avoid directly executing critical operations within the button action; delegate to secure backend services or data access layers.

*   **Malicious Button Actions**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the actions performed when `MGSwipeTableCell`'s swipe buttons are triggered.
    *   **How MGSwipeTableCell Contributes:** `MGSwipeTableCell` provides the mechanism to define and trigger custom actions associated with its swipe buttons. The security of these actions is entirely dependent on the developer's implementation.
    *   **Example:** A button action associated with a swipe in `MGSwipeTableCell` modifies user settings without proper validation, potentially leading to unintended consequences or security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of application state or user data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the button action handlers defined for `MGSwipeTableCell`. Ensure that any data modified or actions performed are within the expected scope and permissions of the user.

*   **UI Redress/Clickjacking via Misleading Buttons**
    *   **Description:** Tricking users into performing unintended actions by visually manipulating the swipe buttons provided by `MGSwipeTableCell`.
    *   **How MGSwipeTableCell Contributes:** `MGSwipeTableCell` offers flexibility in customizing button appearance (titles, colors, icons). This flexibility can be misused to create buttons that look like one action but perform another.
    *   **Example:** A "Cancel" button within an `MGSwipeTableCell` is visually styled and positioned to appear as a "Confirm" button when swiped in a particular direction, leading the user to unintentionally perform a destructive action.
    *   **Impact:** Unintended actions performed by the user, potentially leading to data loss or security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Design swipe button actions and labels within `MGSwipeTableCell` to be clear and unambiguous. Avoid visually mimicking destructive actions with benign ones. Follow UI/UX best practices for clarity and consistency when using `MGSwipeTableCell`.
