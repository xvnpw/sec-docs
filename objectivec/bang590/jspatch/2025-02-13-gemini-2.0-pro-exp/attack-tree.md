## Attack Tree Path: [1. Intercept & Modify JSPatch Script [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__intercept_&_modify_jspatch_script__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical and likely attack vector. The attacker aims to control the JavaScript code executed by JSPatch, effectively taking over the application's behavior.
*   **Criticality:** This is a *critical node* because successful modification of the script grants the attacker complete control.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1a__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker positions themselves between the client device and the server hosting the JSPatch script, intercepting and potentially modifying the network traffic.
*   **Criticality:** A *critical node* as it's a direct method to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a1. ARP Spoofing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1a1__arp_spoofing__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** On a local network (e.g., public Wi-Fi), the attacker sends forged ARP messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of the server hosting the JSPatch script. This redirects traffic intended for the server to the attacker's machine.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1a2. DNS Spoofing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1a2__dns_spoofing__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker compromises a DNS server or poisons the client's DNS cache to resolve the domain name of the JSPatch server to the attacker's IP address.  This redirects the client's request to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1b. Compromise JSPatch Hosting Server/CDN [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1b__compromise_jspatch_hosting_servercdn__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the server or CDN infrastructure that hosts the legitimate JSPatch script.  This allows them to replace the script with a malicious version.
*   **Criticality:** A *critical node* because it affects all users of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1b1. Exploit Server Vulnerability [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1b1__exploit_server_vulnerability__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the server's software (e.g., operating system, web server, application framework) to gain unauthorized access.  This could involve exploiting unpatched software, weak configurations, or known vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [1b2. Compromise Credentials [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1b2__compromise_credentials__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker obtains valid credentials (e.g., usernames, passwords, API keys) that grant access to the server or CDN. This could be achieved through phishing, brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or social engineering.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [1c. Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/1c__social_engineering.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses deception and manipulation to trick individuals into performing actions that compromise security.

## Attack Tree Path: [1c1. Phishing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1c1__phishing__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends deceptive emails, messages, or creates fake websites that appear to be from a legitimate source (e.g., the application developer, a trusted service).  The goal is to trick the user into clicking a link that downloads a malicious JSPatch script or providing credentials that can be used to compromise the server.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
