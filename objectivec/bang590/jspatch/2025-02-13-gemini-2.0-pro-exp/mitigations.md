## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Signing and Integrity Verification of the Patch Script](./mitigation_strategies/code_signing_and_integrity_verification_of_the_patch_script.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Cryptographic Verification of JSPatch Script
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Generation:** Before deploying a JSPatch script, generate a cryptographic signature using a strong algorithm (e.g., ECDSA with SHA-256 or better). This uses a private key (kept *extremely* secure) to create a signature unique to the script's content.
        2.  **Distribution:** Distribute the script *and* its signature.
        3.  **Verification (App Side):**
            *   Before executing *any* code from the downloaded JSPatch script, the application retrieves the corresponding public key (securely embedded within the app).
            *   The app uses the public key and the downloaded signature to verify the integrity of the downloaded script.
            *   If verification *fails*, the script is *immediately* rejected. An error should be logged.
            *   If verification *succeeds*, proceed (with other checks).
        4.  **Hashing (Recommended):** Calculate a SHA-256 hash of the *original* script. Store this hash securely within the app. Before signature verification, calculate the hash of the *downloaded* script. Compare. Reject if they don't match.
        5.  **Secure Storage:** After successful verification, store the script securely (e.g., encrypted storage, Keychain).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Malicious Script Injection (Severity: Critical) - Attacker modifies the script to inject malicious code.
        *   **Threat:** Script Tampering (Severity: Critical) - Attacker alters the script's behavior.
        *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Code Execution (Severity: Critical) - Unverified code runs within the app.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Malicious Script Injection: Risk significantly reduced.
        *   Script Tampering: Risk significantly reduced.
        *   Unauthorized Code Execution: Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Hashing is implemented in `NetworkManager.downloadPatch()`. Expected hash in `SecurityConstants.swift`.
        *   Basic HTTPS is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Full digital signature verification is *not* implemented.
        *   Secure storage after verification is *not* implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Delivery of the Patch Script](./mitigation_strategies/secure_delivery_of_the_patch_script.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** HTTPS with Certificate Pinning for JSPatch Downloads
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **HTTPS:** *All* communication with the server hosting the JSPatch script *must* use HTTPS.
        2.  **Certificate Pinning:**
            *   **Identify:** Get the server's SSL/TLS certificate (or its public key).
            *   **Embed:** Embed the certificate/public key in the app.
            *   **Verification:** During HTTPS connection:
                *   Get the server's certificate.
                *   Compare it to the embedded pin.
                *   If they *match*, proceed.
                *   If they *don't match*, *terminate* the connection and log an error.
        3. **Regular Updates:** Update the pinned certificate/key in the app when the server's certificate is renewed.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (Severity: Critical) - Attacker intercepts and modifies the JSPatch script.
        *   **Threat:** Eavesdropping (Severity: High) - Attacker listens to the communication (less critical for JSPatch than modification).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   MitM Attack: Risk significantly reduced.
        *   Eavesdropping: Risk reduced (HTTPS provides encryption).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic HTTPS is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Certificate pinning is *not* implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (within the JavaScript)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__within_the_javascript_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Defensive JavaScript Programming *within* JSPatch Scripts
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Minimize API Surface (Objective-C):**  Carefully design the Objective-C interface exposed to JSPatch. Only expose the *absolute minimum* needed.
        2.  **Input Validation (Whitelist - in JavaScript):**  In the JavaScript code, *strictly* validate *all* input from:
            *   User interaction.
            *   External sources.
            *   Arguments from Objective-C.
            *   Use *whitelisting*: define *allowed* values and reject anything else.
        3.  **Output Encoding (in JavaScript):** If the JavaScript interacts with the UI, use proper output encoding to prevent injection attacks (e.g., HTML escaping for `UIWebView`).
        4. **Type Checking (in JavaScript):** Use strict type checking.
        5. **Regular Expressions (Careful Use - in JavaScript):** If using regex, avoid ReDoS vulnerabilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High) - If the script interacts with a `UIWebView`.
        *   **Threat:** Code Injection (Severity: High) - Through unvalidated input.
        *   **Threat:** Logic Errors (Severity: Variable) - Due to improper input handling.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS: Risk reduced.
        *   Code Injection: Risk reduced.
        *   Logic Errors: Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Some basic input validation exists.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive, consistent whitelisting is *not* used.
        *   Output encoding is *not* consistently used.
        *   The Objective-C interface is too broad.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (Objective-C Side)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__objective-c_side_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Exposed Objective-C Interface *for JSPatch*
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review:** Review *all* Objective-C methods/properties exposed to JSPatch.
        2.  **Restrict:** Remove access to *anything* not *absolutely essential*.
        3.  **Refactor:** If needed, refactor Objective-C to create a limited, secure interface *specifically* for JSPatch.
        4.  **Documentation:** Document the purpose and security of each exposed item.
        5.  **Regular Audits:** Re-review the interface periodically.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation (Severity: High) - Compromised script accesses sensitive data/functions.
        *   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access (Severity: High) - Through exposed methods.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Privilege Escalation: Risk significantly reduced.
        *   Unauthorized Access: Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   None. Wide range of methods exposed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Complete review and restriction needed.
