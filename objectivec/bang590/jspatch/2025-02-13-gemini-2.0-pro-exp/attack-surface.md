# Attack Surface Analysis for bang590/jspatch

## Attack Surface: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Patch Injection](./attack_surfaces/1__remote_code_execution__rce__via_malicious_patch_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code within the application's context by injecting a malicious JavaScript patch.
*   **How JSPatch Contributes:** JSPatch *is the direct mechanism* for this attack. It provides the functionality to load and execute externally sourced JavaScript, which is the core of the RCE vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises the patch distribution server and replaces a legitimate patch with one containing malicious code to steal user data, install malware, or take control of the application.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data theft, potential device compromise, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Patch Signing and Verification:** Digitally sign patches on the server; the app *must* verify the signature before execution. Use strong cryptographic algorithms.
    *   **Strict HTTPS with Certificate Pinning:** Enforce HTTPS and use certificate pinning to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks that could intercept and modify patches.
    *   **Hardcoded Patch Source URL:** Avoid dynamic URL resolution; hardcode the trusted patch server URL(s) within the application.
    *   **Secure Patch Storage:** Store downloaded patches in a secure, sandboxed location within the application, preventing tampering by other apps or processes.
    *   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** Consider using a RASP solution to detect and prevent runtime code modifications, even those initiated by JSPatch.

## Attack Surface: [2. Security Control Bypass via Method Swizzling/Overriding](./attack_surfaces/2__security_control_bypass_via_method_swizzlingoverriding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses a malicious patch to disable or circumvent security features built into the application by overriding or modifying existing Objective-C methods.
*   **How JSPatch Contributes:** JSPatch's core functionality allows it to *directly override* Objective-C methods. This is the *primary* way it achieves its patching capabilities, and it's also the *direct* enabler of this attack.
*   **Example:** A patch overrides the `isJailbroken` method (or similar jailbreak detection logic) to always return `false`, allowing the app to run on a compromised device and potentially access sensitive data that should be protected. Another example: bypassing in-app purchase validation by overriding the relevant methods.
*   **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to other attacks, unauthorized access to features or data, potential financial loss (if bypassing payment checks).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Critical Logic in Native Code (with Anti-Tampering):** Implement the *most* crucial security checks (jailbreak detection, core authentication) in native code and employ techniques to make them *resistant* to patching (e.g., obfuscation, integrity checks, anti-debugging). This raises the bar significantly.
    *   **Redundant Security Checks:** Implement security checks in *both* native code and JavaScript (if applicable). Even if the JavaScript check is bypassed via JSPatch, the native check might still catch the attacker.
    *   **RASP:** Use a RASP solution to detect and prevent unauthorized modifications to security-critical methods.

## Attack Surface: [3. Data Exfiltration via API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/3__data_exfiltration_via_api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious patch leverages JSPatch's access to Objective-C APIs to access and transmit sensitive user data or application data to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **How JSPatch Contributes:** JSPatch provides the *bridge* to Objective-C APIs. Without JSPatch, accessing these APIs from externally loaded JavaScript would be impossible in a standard iOS application. This access is *essential* for the attack.
*   **Example:** A patch uses JSPatch to call Keychain APIs to retrieve stored credentials and then uses network APIs (also accessible via JSPatch) to send those credentials to a malicious server. Another example: overriding network request methods to intercept and exfiltrate data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (App Permissions):** Ensure the application requests only the *minimum necessary* permissions from the operating system. This limits the scope of what a malicious patch can access.
    *   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both at rest (in storage) and in transit (during network communication). Even if exfiltrated, the data is useless without the decryption key.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices (Native Code):** Follow secure coding guidelines in the *native* code to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a malicious patch to gain unauthorized access to data.
    *   **Network Security (HTTPS with Pinning):** Use HTTPS with certificate pinning for *all* communication involving sensitive data. This prevents MitM attacks that could intercept data.

## Attack Surface: [4. Downgrade Attacks (Reintroducing Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/4__downgrade_attacks__reintroducing_vulnerabilities_.md)

* **Description:** Forcing the application to use an older, vulnerable version of a patch.
* **How JSPatch Contributes:** If version control is not properly enforced by the application logic that *uses* JSPatch, then JSPatch itself becomes the *tool* used to load and execute the older, vulnerable patch. The vulnerability isn't in JSPatch itself, but in how it's *used*.
* **Example:** An attacker intercepts the patch download and provides an older patch file with a known vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Reintroduction of previously patched vulnerabilities.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Version Control:** Implement robust versioning. The app *must* only apply patches with a version number *greater than or equal to* the current version. Reject older versions. This logic is *outside* of JSPatch itself, but is critical for secure use of JSPatch.
    *   **Signed Metadata:** Include version information in digitally signed metadata.
