## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Malicious JSPatch Updates [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_malicious_jspatch_updates__critical_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete security failure related to JSPatch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via JSPatch [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_jspatch__critical_.md)

*   The core action required to compromise the application through JSPatch. This involves either manipulating the patch delivery or exploiting vulnerabilities in how JSPatch handles patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Patch Delivery Mechanism [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_patch_delivery_mechanism__critical_.md)

*   Attackers target the infrastructure responsible for delivering JSPatch updates. Success here allows for widespread distribution of malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Patch Server [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_patch_server__critical_.md)

    *   Gaining control of the server hosting the patch files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server Vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server_vulnerabilities__e_g___sql_injection__rce_.md)

        *   Leveraging weaknesses in the server software or its configuration to gain unauthorized access and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Server Credentials (e.g., Brute-force, Phishing)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_server_credentials__e_g___brute-force__phishing_.md)

        *   Obtaining valid login credentials through various means to access and modify patch files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Patch Download [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_patch_download__critical_.md)

    *   Intercepting and altering the patch file during its transmission from the server to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Modify HTTP Traffic (if not using HTTPS or weak HTTPS)](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_modify_http_traffic__if_not_using_https_or_weak_https_.md)

        *   Exploiting the lack of encryption or weak encryption to intercept and modify the patch content in transit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Patch Directly](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_patch_directly.md)

    *   Gaining unauthorized access to the patch management system to upload malicious patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Credentials of Authorized Personnel](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_credentials_of_authorized_personnel.md)

        *   Targeting developers or administrators with access to the patch management system through phishing or other social engineering techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in JSPatch Implementation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jspatch_implementation__critical_.md)

*   Directly targeting weaknesses in the JSPatch library or its usage within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Validation of Patch Content [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_validation_of_patch_content__critical_.md)

    *   The application fails to adequately check the contents of a JSPatch update before executing it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript Code [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_code__critical_.md)

        *   Inserting harmful JavaScript code into the patch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data and Resources](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data_and_resources.md)

            *   Malicious JavaScript accessing local storage, user data, or other sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect User Flow to Phishing Pages](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_user_flow_to_phishing_pages.md)

            *   Modifying the application's navigation to direct users to fake login pages or other malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Secure Code Practices in JSPatch Usage [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_secure_code_practices_in_jspatch_usage__critical_.md)

    *   Developers introduce vulnerabilities by how they integrate and use JSPatch.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Native Functions to JSPatch without Proper Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_native_functions_to_jspatch_without_proper_sanitization.md)

        *   Making native functions that handle sensitive operations accessible to JSPatch without proper input validation, allowing malicious JavaScript to exploit them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Code within Application Context [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_code_within_application_context__critical_.md)

*   The successful execution of the injected malicious code within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Successfully Applied Malicious JSPatch [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/successfully_applied_malicious_jspatch__critical_.md)

*   The point at which the malicious JSPatch has been downloaded and applied, leading to the potential execution of malicious code.
