# Threat Model Analysis for bang590/jspatch

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Patch Delivery](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_patch_delivery.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the patch server. They can then inject a malicious patch payload into the response before it reaches the application. This allows the attacker to deliver and execute arbitrary code within the application's context *due to JSPatch's reliance on fetching remote code*.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data theft, modification of application behavior, potential takeover of the application and the user's device.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Malicious Patch Content - Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_patch_content_-_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript patch that, when executed by the JSPatch engine, allows them to run arbitrary code within the application's sandbox. *This is a direct consequence of JSPatch's core functionality: dynamic code execution*.

**Impact:** Data theft, access to device resources (camera, microphone, location), application takeover, potential device compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Malicious Patch Content - Data Exfiltration](./threats/malicious_patch_content_-_data_exfiltration.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript patch designed to extract sensitive data from the application's memory or storage and send it to an attacker-controlled server. *JSPatch's ability to modify code at runtime enables this data exfiltration*.

**Impact:** Loss of user credentials, personal information, financial data, or other sensitive application data.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Malicious Patch Content - Functionality Tampering](./threats/malicious_patch_content_-_functionality_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses a malicious patch to alter the intended functionality of the application. This could involve bypassing security checks, enabling unauthorized features, or manipulating the application's logic for malicious purposes (e.g., manipulating in-app purchases). *JSPatch's dynamic patching capability is the mechanism for this tampering*.

**Impact:** Circumvention of security measures, unauthorized access to features, financial loss, damage to application integrity.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in JSPatch Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_jspatch_library_itself.md)

**Description:** The JSPatch library itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws) that an attacker could exploit by crafting specific malicious patches or by manipulating the patching process. *This directly relates to the security of the JSPatch codebase*.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, unexpected application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High
