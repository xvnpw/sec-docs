# Threat Model Analysis for bang590/jspatch

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Patches](./threats/injection_of_malicious_patches.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the patch delivery mechanism to inject malicious JavaScript code into a patch. This code is then downloaded and executed by the **JSPatch Engine**, allowing the attacker to control the application's behavior.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data exfiltration of sensitive user information.
        *   Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
        *   Displaying phishing messages or malicious content within the application.
        *   Remote code execution leading to device compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   JSPatch Engine (the component responsible for executing the JavaScript code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement code signing for patches and verify the signature on the client-side **before** the JSPatch Engine executes the patch.
        *   Enforce HTTPS with proper certificate validation for all communication related to patch delivery to prevent tampering before reaching the JSPatch Engine.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the JSPatch execution environment to limit the impact of potentially malicious code.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Patch Delivery Leading to Malicious JSPatch Execution](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_patch_delivery_leading_to_malicious_jspatch_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the patch server and modifies the patch content before it reaches the application. The modified, malicious JavaScript is then executed by the **JSPatch Engine**.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary code within the application's context via the JSPatch Engine.
        *   Data manipulation or theft.
        *   Application malfunction or instability caused by malicious JSPatch code.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   JSPatch Engine (patch execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all patch delivery communication to prevent interception and modification before reaching the JSPatch Engine.
        *   Implement certificate pinning to prevent attackers from using fraudulent certificates when communicating with the patch server.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Native Functionality via Malicious JSPatch](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_native_functionality_via_malicious_jspatch.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious patch, executed by the **JSPatch Engine**, could access and manipulate native functionalities of the application that are not intended to be exposed or modified through JavaScript, bypassing native security controls.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Circumvention of native security measures through JSPatch.
        *   Access to sensitive device resources or data via JSPatch.
        *   Potential for privilege escalation facilitated by JSPatch.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   JSPatch Bridge (the interface between JavaScript and native code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control and restrict the native functionalities exposed to JSPatch through the JSPatch Bridge.
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of data passed between JavaScript (executed by JSPatch) and native code.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to native functionalities from JSPatch.

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Checks via Malicious JSPatch](./threats/bypassing_security_checks_via_malicious_jspatch.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could use patches, executed by the **JSPatch Engine**, to modify the application's code in a way that directly bypasses existing security checks or authentication mechanisms implemented within the application's logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to protected features or data due to JSPatch modifications.
        *   Circumvention of security policies enforced by the application, achieved through JSPatch.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   JSPatch Engine (patch execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Design security checks that are difficult to bypass through dynamic patching by the JSPatch Engine.
        *   Implement integrity checks on critical security components of the application that are potentially modifiable by JSPatch.
        *   Regularly review and audit the application's security mechanisms in the context of potential JSPatch modifications.
