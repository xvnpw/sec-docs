# Attack Surface Analysis for bang590/jspatch

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Patch Delivery](./attack_surfaces/insecure_patch_delivery.md)

- **Description:** Patches containing code updates are delivered over an insecure channel, allowing attackers to intercept and modify them.
    - **JSPatch Contribution:** JSPatch relies on downloading and applying code updates at runtime, making it vulnerable to attacks targeting the delivery mechanism.
    - **Example:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network and replaces a legitimate JSPatch update with a malicious one containing code to steal user credentials.
    - **Impact:** Critical - Allows for arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to data theft, device compromise, and complete application takeover.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement HTTPS for all patch downloads to encrypt communication. Use certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks. Implement integrity checks (e.g., using cryptographic signatures) to verify the authenticity and integrity of downloaded patches before applying them.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Patch Server](./attack_surfaces/compromised_patch_server.md)

- **Description:** The server hosting the JSPatch updates is compromised, allowing attackers to distribute malicious patches to all applications using that server.
    - **JSPatch Contribution:** JSPatch's reliance on an external source for code updates makes it susceptible to vulnerabilities in that source.
    - **Example:** Attackers gain access to the patch server and replace the current legitimate patch with a malicious one that installs spyware on user devices upon application update.
    - **Impact:** Critical - Wide-scale compromise of applications and user devices, potentially affecting a large user base.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement robust security measures for the patch server, including strong access controls, regular security audits, and intrusion detection systems. Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with strong security features. Implement mechanisms to verify the source and authenticity of patches.

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Patch Content](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_patch_content.md)

- **Description:** The application applies downloaded patches without proper validation, allowing execution of arbitrary and potentially malicious JavaScript code.
    - **JSPatch Contribution:** JSPatch's core functionality is to execute JavaScript code provided in the patches, inherently creating this attack surface if validation is lacking.
    - **Example:** A malicious actor crafts a JSPatch update containing JavaScript code that accesses sensitive user data stored locally on the device and sends it to an external server.
    - **Impact:** Critical - Allows for arbitrary code execution, leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and potential device takeover.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of patch content before execution. Consider using a sandboxed environment for patch execution (though this might be challenging with JSPatch's design). Thoroughly review and test all patches before deployment. Implement a rollback mechanism in case a malicious patch is deployed.
