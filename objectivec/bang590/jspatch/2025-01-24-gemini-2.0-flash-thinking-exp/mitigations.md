# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bang590/jspatch

## Mitigation Strategy: [Eliminate JSPatch Usage](./mitigation_strategies/eliminate_jspatch_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Audit:** Conduct a thorough code audit to identify all instances where JSPatch is currently used within the application codebase.
    2.  **Feature Refactoring:** For each feature or bug fix currently implemented using JSPatch, plan and execute a refactoring process to reimplement the functionality using native code (Objective-C/Swift).
    3.  **Standard Update Process:** Ensure that all future updates and bug fixes are deployed through the standard App Store update process, avoiding any dynamic patching mechanisms like JSPatch.
    4.  **JSPatch Removal:** Completely remove the JSPatch SDK and any related code from the application codebase.
    5.  **Verification:** Thoroughly test the application after refactoring and JSPatch removal to ensure all functionalities are working as expected and no regressions are introduced.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Patch:** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Patch Injection:** Severity: **High**.
    *   **Unauthorized Feature Modification via Patches:** Severity: **Medium**.
    *   **Circumvention of App Store Review using JSPatch:** Severity: **Medium**.

*   **Impact:** **Significant Reduction** in risk for all listed threats. Eliminating JSPatch removes the entire attack surface associated with dynamic JavaScript patching.

*   **Currently Implemented:** **No**. JSPatch is currently used for hotfixes and minor UI adjustments in production builds.

*   **Missing Implementation:** This strategy is missing entirely. The project relies on JSPatch for rapid updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict JSPatch Scope and Functionality](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_jspatch_scope_and_functionality.md)
