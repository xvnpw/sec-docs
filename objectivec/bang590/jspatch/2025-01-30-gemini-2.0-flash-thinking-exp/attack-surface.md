# Attack Surface Analysis for bang590/jspatch

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Patch Server (Delivery Infrastructure)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_patch_server__delivery_infrastructure_.md)

*   **Description:** The server hosting JavaScript patches is compromised, allowing attackers to replace legitimate patches with malicious ones.
*   **JSPatch Contribution:** JSPatch *directly* relies on fetching patches from a remote server. Compromising this server allows attackers to control the application's behavior via malicious patches delivered through JSPatch's mechanism.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the patch server and replaces a legitimate patch with a JavaScript file that steals user credentials. When the application updates via JSPatch, it downloads and executes this malicious patch.
*   **Impact:**  Widespread application compromise, data theft, user account takeover, malware distribution, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Server Infrastructure:** Implement robust server security measures (strong access controls, regular security audits, patching, intrusion detection).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit access to the patch server to only authorized personnel and systems.
    *   **Secure Development Practices:**  Use secure coding practices for server-side applications and infrastructure.
    *   **Regular Security Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor server logs and activity for suspicious behavior.
    *   **Supply Chain Security:**  Vet and secure all components of the patch server infrastructure and dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Patch Download](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_patch_download.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept and modify patch downloads during transit between the application and the patch server.
*   **JSPatch Contribution:** JSPatch's patch download process, if not secured, is *directly* vulnerable to network interception. JSPatch initiates the download, and if this process uses insecure protocols, it creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A user on a compromised network. The application attempts to download a patch over HTTP via JSPatch. An attacker intercepts the request, replaces the legitimate patch with a malicious one, and forwards it. JSPatch executes the malicious patch.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data theft, unauthorized access, malware injection, localized or widespread depending on the attack scale.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:**  *Always* use HTTPS for patch downloads initiated by JSPatch to encrypt communication and prevent interception.
    *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning to ensure the application only trusts the legitimate patch server's certificate during JSPatch patch downloads.
    *   **VPN Usage (User-Side):** Encourage users to use VPNs, especially on public networks, to encrypt their network traffic (user-side mitigation).

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Patch Integrity Verification](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_patch_integrity_verification.md)

*   **Description:** The application does not verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded patches, allowing execution of tampered patches.
*   **JSPatch Contribution:** If JSPatch integration *lacks* patch verification, the application *directly* executes any JavaScript code it receives, creating a vulnerability. JSPatch itself doesn't enforce verification unless implemented by the developer.
*   **Example:** Even with HTTPS, if the patch server is compromised, or a sophisticated MITM attack occurs, without integrity checks, JSPatch will accept and execute a modified patch containing malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data theft, code execution, bypassing other security measures, potential for persistent malware within the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Patch Signing:** Digitally sign patches on the server before JSPatch downloads them.
    *   **Signature Verification:** Implement signature verification in the application *within the JSPatch integration* before executing any patch.
    *   **Checksum Verification:**  Use checksums (like SHA-256) to verify patch integrity after download within the JSPatch process.
    *   **Secure Key Management:**  Properly manage and protect the private key used for signing patches.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted JavaScript Execution within Application Context](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_javascript_execution_within_application_context.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript patches can execute arbitrary code within the application's JavaScript environment, gaining access to application resources and data.
*   **JSPatch Contribution:** JSPatch's *core functionality* is to execute JavaScript within the application context. This *directly* grants significant power to patches, making unrestricted execution a key attack surface introduced by JSPatch's design.
*   **Example:** A malicious patch, executed by JSPatch, uses JSPatch's bridge to access and exfiltrate user data stored in local storage or the keychain.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, manipulation of application behavior, potential for further exploitation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Patching Scope:**  Restrict the scope of what can be patched dynamically via JSPatch. Avoid patching security-critical or sensitive functionalities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (in Patches):**  Implement input validation and sanitization *within* JavaScript patches to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (for Patches):** Design patches with the minimum necessary permissions and access to application resources within the JSPatch context.
    *   **Code Review for Patches:**  Thoroughly review all patches for security vulnerabilities and malicious code *before* deployment via JSPatch.

## Attack Surface: [JSPatch Bridge Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jspatch_bridge_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in the JSPatch bridge itself can be exploited by malicious patches to gain unintended access to native code or bypass security controls.
*   **JSPatch Contribution:** JSPatch's bridge is the *direct* mechanism that allows JavaScript patches to interact with native iOS code. Vulnerabilities in *this specific bridge implementation* are a direct attack surface introduced by using JSPatch.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the JSPatch bridge allows a malicious patch to bypass access controls and directly call a native API that should be restricted.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, native code execution vulnerabilities, application crashes, complete application takeover, potential for system-level compromise in severe cases.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on the nature of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular JSPatch Updates:** Keep JSPatch library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches *in JSPatch itself*.
    *   **Security Audits of JSPatch Integration:** Conduct security audits specifically focusing on the *JSPatch bridge* and its interaction with native code in your application.
    *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Use static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the *JSPatch bridge integration*.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** If vulnerabilities are found in *JSPatch itself*, report them to the JSPatch maintainers (if the project is still actively maintained) or consider alternative patching solutions.
