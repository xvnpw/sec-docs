# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: Enable rapid deployment of bug fixes and feature updates to iOS applications without requiring full app store review cycles.
  - Priority: Speed and agility in responding to user issues and market demands by bypassing traditional app update processes.
  - Priority: Maintain application stability and availability by quickly addressing critical bugs.
- Business Risks:
  - Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities introduced through dynamically loaded patches, potentially bypassing standard security review processes.
  - Business Risk: Instability and unexpected behavior in applications if patches are not thoroughly tested or are poorly implemented.
  - Business Risk: Compliance violations if the patching mechanism circumvents app store guidelines or introduces functionality that violates terms of service.
  - Business Risk: Reputational damage and loss of user trust if security incidents or application instability arise from the patching system.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: iOS Code Signing - Ensures that the base application is signed by a trusted developer, providing a baseline level of trust for the initial application code. Implemented by Apple's iOS platform.
  - security control: HTTPS for Patch Delivery (Assumed) - Encrypts communication between the application and the patch server, protecting patches in transit from eavesdropping and tampering. Implementation location depends on the patch delivery infrastructure.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dynamic Code Loading - Accepting the inherent risks of executing code that was not part of the original application package, which can increase the attack surface if not carefully managed.
  - accepted risk: Potential for Bypassing App Store Review - Accepting the risk that the patching mechanism might be used to deploy features or changes that would not pass standard app store review, potentially leading to policy violations.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Patch Integrity Verification - Implement cryptographic signing of patches to ensure that the application only executes patches that originate from a trusted source and have not been tampered with in transit.
  - security control: Input Validation for Patches - Thoroughly validate the structure and content of patches before execution to prevent injection of malicious code or unexpected behavior.
  - security control: Secure Patch Storage - If patches are stored on a server, ensure secure storage mechanisms are in place to protect patch integrity and confidentiality.
  - security control: Access Control for Patch Management - Implement strict access controls to the patch generation and deployment infrastructure to limit who can create and deploy patches.
  - security control: Monitoring and Logging of Patch Application - Log patch application events, including successful and failed attempts, to detect anomalies and potential security incidents.
  - security control: Rollback Mechanism - Implement a robust rollback mechanism to quickly revert to a previous application state in case a patch introduces critical issues.
  - security control: Security Testing of Patches - Conduct security testing, including SAST and DAST, on patches before deployment to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Implement authentication for developers or systems that are authorized to create, sign, and deploy patches.
    - Requirement: Securely manage and store authentication credentials used for patch management.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Define and enforce authorization policies to control who can perform actions such as creating, reviewing, approving, deploying, and rolling back patches.
    - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for patch management operations.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Implement strict input validation for all patch content to prevent code injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other input-based vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Validate patch structure, syntax, and semantics to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious payloads.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use cryptographic signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of patches.
    - Requirement: Employ strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices for patch signing and verification.
    - Requirement: Consider encryption for patches if they contain sensitive logic or data, both in transit and at rest.

```

- Build Process:
  - Step 1: Developer creates JavaScript code changes intended as a patch.
  - Step 2: Developer uses the Patch Generation Tool to create a patch file from the code changes.
  - Step 3: The Patch Signing Tool is used to cryptographically sign the generated patch file. This step ensures patch integrity and authenticity.
  - Step 4: The signed patch artifact is produced.
  - Step 5: The signed patch artifact is deployed to the Patch Server. This could be a manual upload or an automated process.
  - Step 6: The Patch Server stores and serves the signed patch.

- Build Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure Development Environment - Developers should use secure development environments to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities during patch creation.
  - security control: Code Review - Implement code review processes for JavaScript patches to identify potential security issues and bugs before deployment.
  - security control: Automated Patch Generation - Automate the patch generation process to reduce manual errors and ensure consistency.
  - security control: Patch Signing Automation - Automate the patch signing process within a secure environment, ensuring that only authorized and properly signed patches are deployed.
  - security control: Access Control to Signing Keys - Securely manage and restrict access to the private keys used for patch signing. Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure key management systems if necessary.
  - security control: Secure Deployment Pipeline - Implement a secure deployment pipeline to transfer signed patches to the Patch Server, ensuring integrity and confidentiality during transit.
  - security control: Version Control - Use version control systems to track changes to patches and manage different patch versions.
  - security control: Audit Logging - Log all build and deployment activities, including patch generation, signing, and deployment, for auditing and security monitoring purposes.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Critical Process: Rapid Bug Fixing - The ability to quickly resolve critical bugs in the iOS application to maintain application stability and user satisfaction.
  - Critical Process: Feature Rollout Agility - The ability to deploy new features or updates to users faster than traditional app store release cycles allow, enabling quicker response to market opportunities.
- Data to Protect:
  - Data: JavaScript Patches - These contain the application logic and are critical for the functionality of the application.
    - Sensitivity: High - Integrity and Availability are critical. Confidentiality may be important if patches contain sensitive business logic.
  - Data: Patch Signing Keys - Private keys used to sign patches.
    - Sensitivity: Critical - Confidentiality and Integrity are paramount. Compromise of signing keys would allow unauthorized patch deployment.
  - Data: Patch Deployment Logs - Logs of patch deployment and application events.
    - Sensitivity: Medium - Integrity and Availability are important for auditing and troubleshooting. Confidentiality may be relevant if logs contain user-specific information.
