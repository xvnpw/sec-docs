## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via JSPatch Exploitation [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_jspatch_exploitation__cr_.md)

* **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control over the application's behavior and potentially user data through JSPatch vulnerabilities.
* **Why Critical:** Represents the ultimate security failure related to JSPatch usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Patch Delivery Mechanism [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_patch_delivery_mechanism__cr_.md)

* **Description:** Targeting the system responsible for delivering JSPatch updates to the application.
* **Why Critical:**  Successful compromise allows the attacker to inject malicious patches into the application update stream, affecting all users receiving updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack [HR] [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__hr___cr_.md)

* **Description:** Intercepting network communication between the application and the patch server to manipulate patch delivery.
* **Why High-Risk:** Relatively easy to execute, especially on unsecured networks. High impact as it allows direct injection of malicious code.
* **Attack Vectors within MITM:**
    * **[1.1.1] Network Sniffing (Unsecured Network) [HR]:**
        * **Description:** Passive interception of network traffic on an unsecured network (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
        * **Why High-Risk:** Common scenario, requires minimal attacker resources.
        * **[1.1.1.1] Intercept Patch Request & Inject Malicious Patch [HR]:**
            * **Description:** Actively modifying intercepted network traffic to replace a legitimate patch with a malicious one.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Direct and effective way to inject malicious code if HTTPS is not used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Patch Server Directly [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_patch_server_directly__cr_.md)

* **Description:** Directly attacking the server infrastructure hosting and managing JSPatch files.
* **Why Critical:** Bypasses client-side security measures and grants the attacker control over the source of patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server Vulnerabilities (Web Server, API Endpoints) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server_vulnerabilities__web_server__api_endpoints___hr_.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting security weaknesses in the web server software, API endpoints, or application logic of the patch server.
* **Why High-Risk:** Web server vulnerabilities are common, and successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise.
* **Attack Vectors within Server Vulnerabilities:**
    * **[1.2.1] Exploit Server Vulnerabilities (Web Server, API Endpoints) [HR]:**
        * **Description:** Identifying and exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in server software.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Common attack vector against web applications.
        * **[1.2.1.1] Gain Access to Patch Storage & Replace Patches [HR]:**
            * **Description:** Using exploited vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the server's file system and replace legitimate JSPatch files with malicious ones.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Direct control over patches, widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Phishing (Target Server Admins) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringphishing__target_server_admins___hr_.md)

* **Description:** Manipulating server administrators into revealing their credentials or performing actions that compromise the patch server.
* **Why High-Risk:** Human factor is often a weak link, social engineering can be very effective.
* **Attack Vectors within Social Engineering:**
    * **[1.2.3] Social Engineering/Phishing (Target Server Admins) [HR]:**
        * **Description:** Using deceptive tactics like phishing emails or phone calls to trick server administrators.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Exploits human psychology, can bypass technical security controls.
        * **[1.2.3.1] Obtain Credentials to Access & Modify Patches [HR]:**
            * **Description:** Stealing administrator credentials through social engineering to gain access to the patch server and modify patches.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Direct access to patch management, widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Patch Validation/Integrity Checks [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_patch_validationintegrity_checks__cr_.md)

* **Description:** Taking advantage of the absence or weakness of mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of JSPatch patches.
* **Why Critical:**  Without validation, any successful compromise of delivery or server becomes immediately exploitable for malicious patch injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [No Signature Verification [HR] [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/no_signature_verification__hr___cr_.md)

* **Description:** The application does not verify any digital signature or checksum of the downloaded patches.
* **Why High-Risk:** Fundamental security flaw, allows trivial injection of malicious patches if delivery is compromised.
* **Attack Vectors within No Signature Verification:**
    * **[2.1] No Signature Verification [HR]:**
        * **Description:**  Lack of any mechanism to verify patch authenticity.
        * **Why High-Risk:**  Completely reliant on delivery mechanism security, which is often insufficient.
        * **[2.1.1] Application Accepts Unsigned Patches [HR]:**
            * **Description:** Application processes and executes patches without any validation.
            * **Why High-Risk:**  Directly enables malicious patch injection.
            * **[2.1.1.1] Inject Malicious Patch via Compromised Delivery (See 1.0) [HR]:**
                * **Description:** Combining lack of signature verification with a compromised delivery mechanism (like MITM or server compromise) to inject and execute malicious code.
                * **Why High-Risk:**  Easiest and most direct path to application compromise if signature verification is missing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting Developers/Deployment Process [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_developersdeployment_process__cr_.md)

* **Description:** Targeting the human element in the development and deployment of JSPatch patches.
* **Why Critical:** Human error and manipulation can bypass even strong technical security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Accounts [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_accounts__hr_.md)

* **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to developer accounts that have privileges to manage and deploy JSPatch patches.
* **Why High-Risk:** Developers often have elevated privileges, compromising their accounts can lead to significant security breaches.
* **Attack Vectors within Compromise Developer Accounts:**
    * **[4.1] Compromise Developer Accounts [HR]:**
        * **Description:** Targeting developer accounts through various methods.
        * **Why High-Risk:** Direct access to patch deployment processes.
        * **[4.1.1] Phishing/Credential Theft [HR]:**
            * **Description:** Using phishing or other credential theft techniques to steal developer login credentials.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Common and effective way to compromise accounts.
        * **[4.1.1.1] Gain Access to Patch Deployment Tools/Processes [HR]:**
            * **Description:** Using compromised developer accounts to access patch deployment systems and inject malicious patches.
            * **Why High-Risk:** Direct path to malicious patch deployment, potentially affecting all users.
