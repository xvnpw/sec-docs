* **Compromised Patch Server:**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains control of the server hosting the JavaScript patches used by JSPatch.
    * **How JSPatch Contributes:** JSPatch *directly relies* on fetching and executing code from a remote server, making this server a critical point of failure.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises the patch server and injects malicious JavaScript code into an update. When the application fetches this update via JSPatch, the malicious code is executed on users' devices.
    * **Impact:**  Complete application compromise, data theft, unauthorized access to device resources, remote code execution on user devices.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong security measures for the patch server (access controls, regular security audits, intrusion detection).
        * Use HTTPS for all communication between the app and the patch server.
        * Implement code signing for patches to verify their authenticity and integrity *before JSPatch executes them*.
        * Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with robust security features.

* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Patch Delivery:**
    * **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the application and the patch server to inject malicious code.
    * **How JSPatch Contributes:** If the patch delivery mechanism used by JSPatch isn't properly secured, it's vulnerable to interception and modification *before the code is executed by JSPatch*.
    * **Example:** An attacker on a shared Wi-Fi network intercepts the download of a JSPatch update and replaces the legitimate JavaScript code with their own malicious script, which is then executed by JSPatch.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on user devices, data manipulation, application takeover.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce HTTPS and implement certificate pinning to ensure the application only communicates with the legitimate patch server *when fetching patches for JSPatch*.
        * Avoid relying solely on network security and implement application-level security measures, such as verifying the integrity of the downloaded patch before execution by JSPatch.

* **Malicious Patches from Internal Sources:**
    * **Description:** A malicious insider or a compromised internal system introduces harmful patches into the deployment pipeline.
    * **How JSPatch Contributes:** JSPatch *directly executes* the patches provided through the deployment pipeline, making it vulnerable to malicious code introduced at this stage.
    * **Example:** A disgruntled developer injects malicious code into a patch that will be executed by JSPatch, leading to the theft of user credentials.
    * **Impact:**  Significant damage, data breaches, reputational harm.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls and authorization mechanisms for the patch creation and deployment process *that feeds into JSPatch*.
        * Implement code review processes for all patches *intended for JSPatch*.
        * Use secure development practices and infrastructure.
        * Employ audit logging to track changes and identify suspicious activity within the patch management system.

* **Bypassing Security Checks in Patch Application:**
    * **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent security checks implemented during the patch application process.
    * **How JSPatch Contributes:** The application's implementation of JSPatch needs to include robust security checks *before executing the downloaded JavaScript*. If these checks are weak or missing, malicious code can be executed.
    * **Example:** The application using JSPatch doesn't properly verify the signature of a downloaded patch, allowing an attacker to inject an unsigned malicious patch that JSPatch then executes.
    * **Impact:** Execution of untrusted code, potential for application compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust signature verification for all downloaded patches *before they are processed by JSPatch*.
        * Ensure proper error handling during patch application to prevent unexpected behavior *when JSPatch attempts to apply a patch*.
        * Avoid relying solely on client-side checks and implement server-side validation where possible.
