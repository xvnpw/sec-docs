## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Malicious Test Execution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_malicious_test_execution.md)

*   This path focuses on leveraging the KIF framework's ability to execute tests to introduce and run malicious code.
*   The success of this path hinges on the ability to inject malicious test code.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise Test Repository/Source Control](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_test_repositorysource_control.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Credential Compromise:** Obtaining valid credentials (usernames and passwords) for the source control system through phishing, brute-force attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in related systems.
    *   **Exploiting Source Control Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging known vulnerabilities in the specific version of the source control software being used.
    *   **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the repository directly introducing malicious test code.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:** Compromising a developer's machine or development environment to gain access to their authenticated session with the repository.
    *   **Weak Access Controls:** Insufficiently restrictive permissions on the repository, allowing unauthorized modification of test files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Test Code](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_test_code.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Successfully compromising the test repository (as detailed above).
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the mechanism KIF uses to load and interpret test files. This could involve path traversal vulnerabilities, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files, or weaknesses in the test parsing logic.
    *   Manipulating KIF's configuration files to point to or include malicious test files from external sources or attacker-controlled locations.
    *   Injecting malicious code directly into test data files that are subsequently used by the test execution engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise KIF's Environment](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_kif's_environment.md)

*   This path involves targeting the environment where the KIF framework is running, aiming to gain control or influence its operation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in KIF's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_kif's_dependencies.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Leveraging Known Vulnerabilities:** Identifying and exploiting publicly known security flaws in the libraries and packages that KIF relies on. This often involves using existing exploit code.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Discovering and exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities in KIF's dependencies, requiring advanced skills and research.
    *   **Dependency Confusion:**  Tricking the package manager into installing a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate dependency from a public repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise the Machine Running KIF Tests](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_the_machine_running_kif_tests.md)

*   Attack Vectors:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or other software running on the test machine to execute arbitrary code remotely.
    *   **Weak Credentials/Authentication:** Guessing or cracking weak passwords used for accessing the test machine or related services.
    *   **Unpatched Systems:** Taking advantage of known vulnerabilities in outdated software or operating systems that haven't been patched.
    *   **Malware Infection:** Introducing malware onto the test machine through various means, such as phishing, drive-by downloads, or exploiting software vulnerabilities.
    *   **Physical Access:** Gaining physical access to the test machine and directly installing malware or manipulating the system.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Compromising another machine on the same network and then using that foothold to access the test machine.
