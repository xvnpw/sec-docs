# Attack Surface Analysis for kif-framework/kif

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Case Injection/Modification](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_case_injectionmodification.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to the test suite and injects or modifies test cases to perform malicious actions against the application under test.
    * **How KIF Contributes to the Attack Surface:** KIF executes these test cases programmatically, allowing injected malicious code to interact with the application's UI and potentially its backend.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects a KIF test case that uses KIF's UI interaction methods to submit a form with malicious data, bypassing client-side validation and exploiting a backend vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, denial of service, or manipulation of application state.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls and authentication for the test repository and development environment.
        * Perform regular code reviews of KIF test cases, just like application code.
        * Use a version control system with proper branching and merging strategies to track changes and identify unauthorized modifications.
        * Implement automated checks and linting for test code to detect suspicious patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Test Environment](./attack_surfaces/compromised_test_environment.md)

* **Description:** If the environment where KIF tests are executed is compromised, attackers can leverage KIF to attack the application.
    * **How KIF Contributes to the Attack Surface:** A compromised test environment with KIF installed becomes a platform for launching attacks against the application under test, as KIF provides the tools for programmatic interaction.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the test server where KIF is installed and configures KIF to execute malicious test cases against the production environment.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, data breaches, denial of service, and reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong security measures for the test environment, including access controls, network segmentation, and regular security patching.
        * Isolate the test environment from the production environment to prevent lateral movement in case of a breach.
        * Monitor the test environment for suspicious activity.
