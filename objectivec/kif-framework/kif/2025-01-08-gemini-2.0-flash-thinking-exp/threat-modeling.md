# Threat Model Analysis for kif-framework/kif

## Threat: [Malicious Test Injection](./threats/malicious_test_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the test definition files (e.g., `.swift` files containing KIF steps) or the test execution environment and injects malicious KIF test steps. These steps are designed to be executed by the KIF framework, allowing the attacker to interact with the application in harmful ways programmatically through KIF's UI interaction capabilities. This could involve performing actions a normal user couldn't, manipulating data, or exfiltrating information.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation within the application, privilege escalation by leveraging KIF's ability to interact with UI elements, potential for remote code execution if KIF interacts with vulnerable parts of the application.

**Affected KIF Component:** Test definition files, KIF's core UI interaction modules (e.g., functions for tapping buttons, entering text, etc.), test runner.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access control for test definition files and the test execution environment.
* Utilize version control for test files and implement mandatory code review processes for all changes to test scripts.
* Secure the CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized modification of test artifacts.
* Implement integrity checks on test files before execution to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
* Consider signing test scripts to verify their authenticity and prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through KIF Test Logs](./threats/information_disclosure_through_kif_test_logs.md)

**Description:** KIF test executions inherently generate logs detailing the steps taken and the application's responses. If these logs contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys used during testing, temporary credentials, or internal system details exposed through UI elements), and these logs are not adequately secured, an attacker could gain access to this data by compromising the log storage or transit mechanisms. The attacker directly benefits from KIF's logging functionality exposing this information.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials and API keys allowing for unauthorized access to systems, disclosure of internal application details aiding further attacks.

**Affected KIF Component:** KIF's logging mechanisms and any integrations with external logging services used by KIF.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Redact sensitive information from KIF test logs before they are stored or transmitted. Configure KIF's logging to avoid capturing sensitive data.
* Implement secure storage and access control for KIF log files, ensuring only authorized personnel can access them.
* Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) for transferring KIF logs to remote systems.
* Consider ephemeral logging or automatic log rotation and deletion policies for KIF logs.
* Educate developers on avoiding the use of sensitive data directly within KIF test steps that would be logged.

## Threat: [Test Environment Compromise Leading to Malicious KIF Usage](./threats/test_environment_compromise_leading_to_malicious_kif_usage.md)

**Description:** If the environment where KIF tests are executed is compromised, an attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary code, including manipulating or executing KIF tests maliciously. This allows them to leverage the KIF framework itself as a tool to interact with the application in an unauthorized and harmful manner. The compromise of the environment directly enables the malicious use of KIF.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the application codebase through manipulated tests, deployment of compromised application versions via malicious KIF interactions, potential for backdoors or persistent access through KIF-driven actions.

**Affected KIF Component:** The KIF test runner and any mechanisms used to trigger KIF test executions within the compromised environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the test environment with the same rigor as production environments, including regular patching and vulnerability scanning.
* Isolate the test environment from production environments to limit the blast radius of a compromise.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the test environment and systems that can trigger KIF tests.
* Monitor the test environment for suspicious activity and unauthorized execution of KIF tests.
* Harden the test environment's operating system and software to prevent exploitation.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in KIF Framework Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_kif_framework_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The KIF framework relies on third-party libraries and dependencies. If these dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities, and those vulnerabilities are exploitable within the context of how KIF uses them, an attacker could potentially leverage these vulnerabilities through the KIF framework. This means the vulnerability, while not in KIF's core code, becomes a threat due to KIF's reliance on the affected component.

**Impact:** Can range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency and how KIF utilizes the vulnerable component.

**Affected KIF Component:** KIF's dependency management system and the specific vulnerable libraries it relies on.

**Risk Severity:** Can be High or Critical depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the KIF framework and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools or dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in KIF's dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for KIF's dependencies and promptly address any identified vulnerabilities.
* Consider using dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent and secure dependency versions.
