# Threat Model Analysis for kif-framework/kif

## Threat: [Test Script Injection](./threats/test_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline, developer workstation, or source code repository and modifies existing KIF test scripts or injects new malicious ones.  They could alter assertions to always pass, bypass login screens, or interact with the application in unintended ways (e.g., deleting data, transferring funds, accessing restricted features). *Crucially, this threat focuses on the attacker manipulating the KIF test scripts themselves, not just using KIF to exploit an existing application bug.*
    *   **Impact:**  Compromised test results, leading to false confidence in application security and functionality.  Potential for malicious actions to be performed against the test environment (and potentially production if misconfigured).  Data breaches or corruption within the test environment.
    *   **Affected KIF Component:**  `.m` (Objective-C) or `.swift` (Swift) files containing KIF test steps and scenarios.  Specifically, any methods using `tester` or `system` objects to interact with the UI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Source Control Security:**  Implement strict access controls and multi-factor authentication for source code repositories.  Require code reviews for all changes to test scripts.
        *   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:**  Secure the CI/CD pipeline with strong authentication, authorization, and auditing.  Use isolated build agents.  Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in the pipeline itself.
        *   **Developer Workstation Security:**  Enforce strong password policies, full-disk encryption, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) on developer machines.
        *   **Test Script Integrity Checks:**  Implement checksums or digital signatures for test scripts to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run tests with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Threat: [KIF Framework Tampering](./threats/kif_framework_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the KIF framework's source code (e.g., through a compromised dependency) or the build process and modifies the framework's core functionality.  They could introduce subtle bugs that cause tests to pass incorrectly, disable security checks within the framework, or even inject malicious code that executes during test runs. *This is a direct attack on the KIF library itself.*
    *   **Impact:**  Undermines the reliability of *all* KIF tests.  Could lead to the deployment of vulnerable applications.  Potential for the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the test runner.
    *   **Affected KIF Component:**  The entire KIF framework, including core classes like `KIFTestActor`, `KIFUIViewTestActor`, `KIFSystemTestActor`, and accessibility-related components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:**  Use a trusted package manager (e.g., CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift Package Manager) and pin KIF to a specific, verified version.  Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Signing:**  If possible, digitally sign the compiled KIF framework to ensure its integrity.
        *   **Source Code Auditing:**  Regularly review the KIF source code (if you have access to it) for any suspicious changes.
        *   **Use Official Sources:** Only obtain KIF from the official GitHub repository or a trusted mirror.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Logging](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_logging.md)

*   **Description:**  KIF tests interact with UI elements containing sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII).  The test scripts or KIF's internal logging mechanisms inadvertently log this data to the console, log files, or test reports. *This focuses on KIF's logging behavior and how test scripts might use it unsafely.*
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized individuals.  Potential for credential theft or privacy violations.
    *   **Affected KIF Component:**  `KIFTestActor` methods that interact with UI elements (e.g., `enterText:intoViewWithAccessibilityLabel:`, `tapViewWithAccessibilityLabel:`), and KIF's internal logging functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Masking:**  Implement custom logging within test scripts that masks sensitive data before logging it.
        *   **Avoid Real Data:**  Use mock data or test accounts with non-sensitive credentials in tests.
        *   **Log Level Control:**  Configure KIF's logging level to minimize the amount of information logged.  Avoid verbose logging in production or shared environments.
        *   **Secure Log Storage:**  Store test logs securely and restrict access to authorized personnel.
        *   **Review Test Output:** Regularly review test output and reports for any accidental exposure of sensitive data.
