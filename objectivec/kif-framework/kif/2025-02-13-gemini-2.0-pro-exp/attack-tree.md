## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Test Execution Environment](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_test_execution_environment.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical attack vector, as it gives the attacker control over how KIF tests are executed.  The attacker aims to run their own malicious KIF code or modify existing tests to achieve their goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise CI/CD Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_cicd_pipeline.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker gains access to the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipeline, allowing them to inject or modify code that will be executed as part of the automated testing process.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform itself (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI).
        *   Compromising credentials of users with access to the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Submitting malicious pull requests that are merged into the codebase.
        *   Social engineering attacks targeting developers with CI/CD access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious KIF Test Code](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_kif_test_code.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker adds new KIF tests containing malicious code.
        *   **Sub-steps & Examples:**
            *   **1.1.1.1:** `tapViewWithAccessibilityLabel`: Tap on elements not intended for testing, potentially triggering unintended actions or navigating to sensitive areas. *Example:* Tapping a hidden "Delete Account" button.
            *   **1.1.1.2:** `enterText:intoViewWithAccessibilityLabel`: Input malicious data into text fields, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the application. *Example:* Injecting SQL code into a search field.
            *   **1.1.1.3:** `waitForViewWithAccessibilityLabel`: Wait for specific application states to ensure malicious actions are executed at the right time. *Example:* Waiting for a confirmation dialog to appear before tapping "OK".
            *   **1.1.1.4:** Custom steps/extensions: Create more complex attack sequences using custom KIF code. *Example:* A custom step that iterates through all UI elements and extracts their text.
            *   **1.1.1.5:** Abuse system alerts/dialogs: Interact with system-level popups to bypass security controls or gain access to system resources. *Example:* Accepting a permission request that the application shouldn't normally trigger.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Existing KIF Test Code](./attack_tree_paths/modify_existing_kif_test_code.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker changes existing KIF tests to perform malicious actions.
        *   **Sub-steps & Examples:**
            *   **1.1.2.1:** Change accessibility labels: Modify the target of existing `tap` or `enterText` commands to interact with different UI elements. *Example:* Changing a label from "LoginButton" to "DeleteAccountButton".
            *   **1.1.2.2:** Modify input text: Change the text entered by `enterText` to include malicious payloads. *Example:* Adding SQL injection code to an existing test that enters a username.
            *   **1.1.2.3:** Alter wait conditions: Modify `waitFor` conditions to trigger actions at unintended times or under different circumstances. *Example:* Changing a wait condition to trigger immediately, bypassing a necessary security check.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machine](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machine.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to a developer's computer, allowing them to directly modify KIF tests, inject code, or intercept test execution.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   Phishing attacks targeting developers.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in software installed on the developer's machine.
        *   Physical access to the machine (e.g., stolen laptop).
        *   Malware infections.
    *   **1.2.1 (Same sub-branches as 1.1.1, 1.1.2):** The attacker can perform the same actions as through CI/CD compromise, but directly on the developer's machine.
    *   **1.2.2 Intercept and modify KIF commands:** The attacker uses tools to intercept and modify the commands sent by KIF to the application during test execution. This is a more sophisticated attack requiring deeper system access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage KIF for Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_kif_for_data_exfiltration.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses KIF's capabilities to access and extract sensitive data from the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Screen Scraping via KIF](./attack_tree_paths/screen_scraping_via_kif.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses KIF to navigate through the application and extract data displayed on the screen.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **3.1.1:** Navigate to screens: Use KIF commands like `tapViewWithAccessibilityLabel` to navigate to screens containing sensitive information (e.g., user profiles, account details, financial data).
        *   **3.1.2:** Read text from UI elements: Use KIF's ability to access accessibility properties (like `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityValue`) to read the text displayed in UI elements.
        *   **3.1.3 Store extracted data [CRITICAL]:**  This is the crucial step where the attacker exfiltrates the data.  It requires either CI/CD compromise (1.1) or developer machine compromise (1.2) to write the data to a file or send it over the network. *Example:*  Appending the extracted text to a file or sending it to a remote server controlled by the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse KIF's ability to take screenshots](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_kif's_ability_to_take_screenshots.md)

* **Description:** The attacker uses KIF to capture screenshots of the application, potentially revealing sensitive information.
    * **Methods:**
        *   **3.3.1 Take screenshots:** Use KIF's screenshot functionality to capture images of screens displaying sensitive data.
        *   **3.3.2 Send the screenshots [CRITICAL]:** Similar to 3.1.3, this requires CI/CD or developer machine compromise to send the screenshots to an attacker-controlled location. *Example:* Uploading the screenshots to a remote server or emailing them to the attacker.
