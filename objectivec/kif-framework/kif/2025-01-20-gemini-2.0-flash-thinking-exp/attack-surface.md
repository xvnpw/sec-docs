# Attack Surface Analysis for kif-framework/kif

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Code Injection/Modification](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_code_injectionmodification.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects or modifies test code to perform malicious actions within the application's context during test execution.
    * **How KIF Contributes:** KIF executes test code that interacts directly with the application's UI and underlying logic. This provides a pathway for malicious code to be executed within the application's environment *by KIF*.
    * **Example:** A compromised developer account pushes a test case that, when executed by KIF, extracts sensitive user data from the UI and sends it to an external server *via KIF's execution context*.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, manipulation of application data, potential compromise of the application server if the test environment is not properly isolated.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls and authentication for code repositories and test environments.
        * Enforce mandatory code reviews for all test code changes.
        * Utilize static analysis tools on test code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        * Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline with automated security checks for test code.
        * Regularly audit test code for suspicious or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Surface: [Test Environment Compromise](./attack_surfaces/test_environment_compromise.md)

* **Description:** The environment where KIF tests are executed is compromised, allowing an attacker to manipulate the testing process or gain access to the application.
    * **How KIF Contributes:** KIF relies on a test environment to run. If this environment is insecure, it can be a stepping stone to attacking the application under test *through the execution of KIF tests*.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD server running KIF tests and modifies the test execution scripts to deploy a backdoor to the application after successful tests *leveraging KIF's execution capabilities*.
    * **Impact:**  Compromise of the application under test, manipulation of test results to hide vulnerabilities, deployment of malicious code.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Harden the security of the CI/CD infrastructure and test environments.
        * Implement network segmentation to isolate test environments from production environments.
        * Regularly patch and update the operating systems and software used in the test environment.
        * Enforce strong authentication and authorization for accessing test environments.
        * Monitor test environment activity for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in KIF or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_kif_or_its_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in KIF itself or its underlying dependencies, which can be exploited by attackers.
    * **How KIF Contributes:** By including KIF in the project, the application inherits the risk associated with KIF's dependencies. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could directly impact KIF's functionality and potentially the application under test.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of a library used by KIF allows for remote code execution if exploited *during KIF test execution*.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution within the test environment or potentially the application if the environments are not sufficiently isolated.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update KIF and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
        * Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in KIF and its dependencies.
        * Implement a process for promptly patching or mitigating identified vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
