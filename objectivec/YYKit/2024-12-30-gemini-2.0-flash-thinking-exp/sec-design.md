*   **YYSecureCoding:**
    *   Threats:
        *   **Bypass Vulnerabilities:**  While designed to prevent deserialization attacks, vulnerabilities might exist in its implementation or usage.

## 7. Threat Model Scope

The scope of the threat model for YYKit primarily focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by the library itself and how it handles data and interacts with the integrating application and system resources. The following are considered within the scope:

*   Vulnerabilities within the YYKit codebase.
*   Improper handling of data by YYKit components.
*   Potential for resource exhaustion caused by YYKit.
*   Security implications of YYKit's interactions with the file system and network (indirectly).

The following are generally considered outside the direct scope of the YYKit threat model, but may need to be considered in the context of the integrating application:

*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system.
*   Security of the device itself.
*   Network security beyond the immediate data transfer initiated or handled by YYKit.
*   Application-specific logic and vulnerabilities outside of YYKit's functionality.
