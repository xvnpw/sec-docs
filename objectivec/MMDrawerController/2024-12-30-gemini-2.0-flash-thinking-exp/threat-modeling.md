Here are the high and critical threats directly involving the `MMDrawerController` library:

* **Threat:** Unexpected Drawer Visibility/State Manipulation
    * **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the `MMDrawerController`'s API itself to programmatically trigger the drawer to open or close at an inappropriate time. This could involve directly calling public methods on the `MMDrawerController` instance if not properly protected or if the library has inherent flaws in its state management.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure (revealing content intended to be hidden), denial of service (obscuring critical UI elements or disrupting user flow), potential for UI spoofing if malicious content is loaded into the drawer.
    * **Affected Component:** The drawer state management logic within `MMDrawerController`, specifically the methods and properties controlling drawer visibility (e.g., `openDrawerSide:animated:completion:`, `closeDrawerAnimated:completion:`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid exposing the `MMDrawerController` instance or its core methods directly to untrusted parts of the application.
        * If possible, review and understand the internal state management of `MMDrawerController` to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        * Consider wrapping or extending `MMDrawerController` to enforce stricter control over drawer state transitions.

* **Threat:** Malicious Content Injection via Drawer (if using `UIWebView`/`WKWebView` within the drawer and the library doesn't offer sufficient protection)
    * **Description:** If the application uses a `UIWebView` or `WKWebView` within a drawer managed by `MMDrawerController`, and the library doesn't provide mechanisms to prevent loading of malicious content, an attacker could inject malicious scripts or content. This is relevant if the drawer displays dynamic content. While the vulnerability might be in the web view itself, the `MMDrawerController`'s role in presenting this content makes it relevant.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions performed on behalf of the user within the context of the web view in the drawer.
    * **Affected Component:** The integration points between `MMDrawerController` and the view controllers used for drawer content, specifically if these involve web views.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) for any web views within the drawer to restrict the sources of executable scripts and other resources.
        * Ensure that any data loaded into web views within the drawer is thoroughly sanitized before display.
        * Consider if `MMDrawerController` offers any configuration options or delegate methods that can be used to control the loading of content into drawer views.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Drawer Implementations/Extensions (directly related to how `MMDrawerController` is extended)
    * **Description:** If the application introduces security flaws while customizing or extending the functionality of `MMDrawerController` (e.g., adding custom gesture recognizers that bypass security checks, or modifying core behavior in an insecure way), new vulnerabilities could be introduced. This directly involves the interaction with and modification of the library's intended behavior.
    * **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including information disclosure, unauthorized access, and code execution.
    * **Affected Component:** Any custom code or extensions built directly into or around `MMDrawerController`'s core functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the introduced vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom drawer functionality that interacts with `MMDrawerController`.
        * Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of any custom code that extends or modifies the library's behavior.
        * Be cautious when overriding or modifying core methods of `MMDrawerController` and ensure that security is not compromised.
        * Isolate custom logic as much as possible to minimize the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
