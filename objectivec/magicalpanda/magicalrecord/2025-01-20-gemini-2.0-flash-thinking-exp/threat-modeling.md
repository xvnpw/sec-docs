# Threat Model Analysis for magicalpanda/magicalrecord

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Incorrect Context Handling](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_incorrect_context_handling.md)

**Description:**  Improper usage of MagicalRecord's context management features can lead to data corruption. This occurs when data is modified in background contexts without proper synchronization with the main thread's context, resulting in inconsistent data states or corrupted data in the persistent store. An attacker, or unintentional code, could exploit this by triggering specific UI interactions while background data operations are in progress, aiming to create conflicting updates.

**Impact:** Loss of data integrity, application crashes due to unexpected data states, potential for business logic errors based on corrupted data, leading to incorrect transactions or decisions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**MagicalRecord Involvement:** This threat directly stems from the way MagicalRecord simplifies and manages Core Data contexts through methods like `MR::contextForCurrentThread` and `MR::saveNestedContexts`.

## Threat: [Concurrency Issues Leading to Data Inconsistency](./threats/concurrency_issues_leading_to_data_inconsistency.md)

**Description:**  MagicalRecord simplifies concurrent operations, but if not used correctly, it can lead to race conditions and data inconsistencies. An attacker might exploit these race conditions by rapidly performing actions that modify the same data from different threads simultaneously, leading to unpredictable outcomes where one update overwrites another, or data relationships become broken.

**Impact:** Data corruption, loss of data integrity, inconsistent application state, potential for security vulnerabilities if data integrity is critical for authorization or other security mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**MagicalRecord Involvement:** This threat is directly related to how MagicalRecord facilitates concurrent data access and the potential for misuse of methods intended for simplifying concurrency (e.g., `performBlock:`, `performBlockAndWait:`).

## Threat: [Developer Misuse/Misunderstanding Leading to Security Vulnerabilities](./threats/developer_misusemisunderstanding_leading_to_security_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The simplicity of MagicalRecord can mask the complexities of Core Data, leading to developers making insecure data handling choices. This could include storing sensitive data without encryption, failing to implement proper access controls within the data model when using MagicalRecord's simplified access patterns, or making incorrect assumptions about data persistence and security.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access to information, potential data breaches, compliance violations.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the data)

**MagicalRecord Involvement:** While not a vulnerability *in* MagicalRecord's code, the library's ease of use can inadvertently encourage insecure practices if developers lack a deep understanding of Core Data security principles. The simplified syntax might hide the underlying complexities where security measures need to be implemented.
