## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Data Access Vulnerabilities (Critical Node: Manipulate Fetch Requests)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_data_access_vulnerabilities__critical_node_manipulate_fetch_requests_.md)

*   Critical Node: Manipulate Fetch Requests
    *   Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to alter the intended data retrieval process by influencing the parameters of fetch requests made through MagicalRecord. This involves crafting inputs that modify the filtering (predicates) or sorting (sort descriptors) of the data being fetched.
    *   High-Risk Node: Craft Malicious Predicates
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers construct malicious predicate strings that, when processed by Core Data through MagicalRecord, retrieve data beyond the scope intended by the application logic. This could involve using logical operators, wildcards, or specific function calls in unexpected ways to bypass intended filtering.
    *   High-Risk Node: Bypass Access Controls through Faulty Logic
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers exploit flaws in the application's authorization logic that relies on MagicalRecord for data retrieval. By manipulating fetch requests, they can potentially bypass these checks and access data belonging to other users or roles, even if the application intends to restrict access.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Setup and Configuration Weaknesses (Critical Node: Insecure Data Storage)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_setup_and_configuration_weaknesses__critical_node_insecure_data_storage_.md)

*   Critical Node: Insecure Data Storage
    *   Attack Vector: The underlying data store used by MagicalRecord (often a SQLite file in local applications) is not adequately protected. This could involve insufficient file system permissions or a lack of encryption.
    *   High-Risk Node: Access Underlying SQLite File (If Applicable)
        *   Attack Vector: If the SQLite database file is stored locally without proper protection, an attacker who gains access to the device's file system can directly access and potentially exfiltrate or modify the database content, bypassing the application's access controls entirely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Vulnerabilities in MagicalRecord Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_vulnerabilities_in_magicalrecord_library_itself.md)

*   Attack Vector: The MagicalRecord library itself may contain security vulnerabilities due to coding errors or oversights.
    *   High-Risk Node: Exploit Known CVEs (if any)
        *   Attack Vector: Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the specific version of MagicalRecord being used by the application. This often involves using pre-existing exploit code or techniques to trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to a range of impacts from denial of service to remote code execution depending on the nature of the flaw.
