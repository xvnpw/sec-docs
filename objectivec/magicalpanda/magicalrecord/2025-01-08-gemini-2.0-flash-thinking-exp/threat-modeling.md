# Threat Model Analysis for magicalpanda/magicalrecord

## Threat: [Data Loss due to Unsaved Changes](./threats/data_loss_due_to_unsaved_changes.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger a scenario (e.g., force-quit the application, cause a crash) before critical data managed by MagicalRecord is explicitly saved to the persistent store. They might also exploit a lack of understanding of MagicalRecord's implicit save behavior to manipulate the application state, leading to data being discarded.

**Impact:** Loss of user-generated data, incomplete transactions, and potential data corruption if related data is saved while other parts are lost.

**Affected MagicalRecord Component:** `save:` methods, background saving mechanisms, and the overall Core Data stack managed by MagicalRecord.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly call `save:` on the appropriate managed object context after critical data modifications.
*   Implement robust application state management to handle unexpected terminations.
*   Educate developers on MagicalRecord's save behavior and lifecycle.
*   Consider using `MR_saveToPersistentStoreAndWait` for critical operations where immediate persistence is required (with awareness of potential UI blocking).

## Threat: [Data Corruption via Race Conditions in Background Saving](./threats/data_corruption_via_race_conditions_in_background_saving.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application to trigger concurrent modifications to the same data managed by MagicalRecord from different threads or processes, especially when background saving is involved. Without proper synchronization, this can lead to data corruption where the final state is inconsistent or reflects only partial updates.

**Impact:** Data corruption, application instability, and potentially security vulnerabilities if corrupted data is used in security-sensitive operations.

**Affected MagicalRecord Component:** Background saving API (`MR_saveInBackground`, `MR_saveToPersistentStoreWithCompletion`), managed object context handling in multi-threaded environments.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid direct manipulation of managed objects across different threads.
*   Use `performBlock:` or `performBlockAndWait:` on the managed object context to ensure operations occur on the correct thread.
*   Implement proper locking mechanisms or other synchronization techniques if sharing data between contexts or threads.
*   Thoroughly test concurrent data access scenarios.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the MagicalRecord Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_the_magicalrecord_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities within the MagicalRecord library itself. This requires the developers to be using an outdated version of the library with known flaws.

**Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial-of-service.

**Affected MagicalRecord Component:** The entire library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the MagicalRecord library updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for MagicalRecord.
*   Consider using dependency management tools to track and update library versions.
