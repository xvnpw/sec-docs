# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for magicalpanda/magicalrecord

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Access Control within Core Data Entities (using MagicalRecord Predicates)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_access_control_within_core_data_entities__using_magicalrecord_predicates_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define User Roles and Permissions:** Clearly define user roles and their data access permissions.
    2.  **Utilize Predicates with MagicalRecord Fetch Methods:** When fetching data using `magicalrecord` methods like `MR_findAllWithPredicate`, `MR_findFirstWithPredicate`, always incorporate predicates that filter results based on the current user's role and permissions.
        *   Example: `[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"createdByUserID == %@ AND accessLevel <= %@", currentUser.userID, currentUser.accessLevel]`
        *   Apply these predicates consistently in your data access layer when using `magicalrecord` to retrieve data.
    3.  **Application-Level Authorization Checks (Post-Fetch):** After fetching data using `magicalrecord`, implement application-level checks to further verify user authorization before displaying or modifying the data. This adds a second layer of defense.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing data they are not permitted to view or modify, by leveraging predicates within `magicalrecord` fetch requests.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data exposure by limiting the data accessible even if `magicalrecord` is used to query the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for malicious users to access data beyond their intended scope by enforcing access control within data retrieval using `magicalrecord`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access: High Impact:** Significantly reduces risk by enforcing access control during data retrieval with `magicalrecord`.
    *   **Data Breach: Medium Impact:** Reduces potential breach scope by limiting accessible data through `magicalrecord` queries.
    *   **Privilege Escalation: Medium Impact:** Adds defense against privilege escalation by controlling data access via `magicalrecord`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic user roles are defined.
    *   Backend API enforces role-based access control.
    *   Location: Backend API, User authentication services.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Predicates based on user roles are not consistently applied in iOS app fetch requests using `magicalrecord`.
    *   Application-level authorization checks are not consistently implemented after fetching data with `magicalrecord`.
    *   Location: iOS app codebase, data access layers, View Controllers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Store Sensitive Data (Encryption for Core Data used by MagicalRecord)](./mitigation_strategies/securely_store_sensitive_data__encryption_for_core_data_used_by_magicalrecord_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable iOS Data Protection for Core Data Store:** Ensure iOS Data Protection is enabled for your application. This encrypts the underlying SQLite database used by Core Data (and thus `magicalrecord`) when the device is locked. Verify in project settings under "Capabilities" -> "Data Protection".
    2.  **Attribute-Level Encryption (Pre-MagicalRecord Save):** For highly sensitive attributes in Core Data entities managed by `magicalrecord`, encrypt these attributes *before* saving them using `magicalrecord`'s save methods (e.g., `MR_saveToPersistentStoreAndWait`).
        *   Encrypt data in your application logic *before* calling `magicalrecord` save methods.
        *   Decrypt data after fetching with `magicalrecord` before using it.
        *   Use libraries like `CryptoKit` or `RNCryptor` for encryption.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach from Physical Device Access (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data managed by `magicalrecord` and Core Data if a device is lost or stolen.
    *   **Data Exposure in Device Backups (Medium Severity):** Encrypted Core Data store (used by `magicalrecord`) will be encrypted in backups.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach from Physical Device Access: High Impact:** Significantly reduces risk of data exposure from physical device compromise affecting `magicalrecord` data.
    *   **Data Exposure in Device Backups: Medium Impact:** Reduces risk in backups of `magicalrecord` data.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   iOS Data Protection is enabled (default).
    *   Location: Project Capabilities settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Attribute-level encryption is not implemented for sensitive Core Data attributes managed by `magicalrecord`.
    *   Location: Data model, data access layers, wherever sensitive data is handled before `magicalrecord` save operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Data Exposure in MagicalRecord Logging](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_data_exposure_in_magicalrecord_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable MagicalRecord Logging in Production:** Disable or significantly reduce `magicalrecord`'s logging output in production builds. Configure logging levels based on build configurations (e.g., using `#if DEBUG`).
    2.  **Redact Sensitive Data in Custom Logging (if using MagicalRecord logging):** If you are using `magicalrecord`'s logging features and need to log data operations, implement redaction or masking of sensitive data before it is logged by `magicalrecord` or your custom logging around `magicalrecord` calls.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Leakage through Logs (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data in `magicalrecord` logs or logs around `magicalrecord` operations.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces unintentional revelation of sensitive information via `magicalrecord` related logs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Leakage through Logs: Medium Impact:** Reduces risk of data leaks from `magicalrecord` logging in production.
    *   **Information Disclosure: Medium Impact:** Minimizes unintentional information disclosure via `magicalrecord` logs.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `magicalrecord`'s default logging is enabled in debug builds.
    *   Location: `magicalrecord` library configuration (potentially default).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `magicalrecord` logging is not disabled or reduced in production builds.
    *   Sensitive data is not redacted in logs related to `magicalrecord` operations.
    *   Location: Logging configuration, logging utility functions, codebase areas using `magicalrecord` with logging.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Input Validation Before MagicalRecord Save](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_input_validation_before_magicalrecord_save.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Input Validation Rules:** Define validation rules for all data fields that will be saved to Core Data using `magicalrecord`.
    2.  **Validate Before MagicalRecord Operations:** Implement input validation logic *before* calling `magicalrecord` methods to save or update data (e.g., `MR_createEntity`, `MR_importValuesForKeysWithObject`).
    3.  **Sanitize Input Data (Pre-MagicalRecord):** Sanitize user inputs *before* saving with `magicalrecord` to prevent injection vulnerabilities if data is later used in queries or UI.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid data from being saved to Core Data via `magicalrecord`.
    *   **Injection Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Mitigates injection risks if unsanitized data saved by `magicalrecord` is later used insecurely.
    *   **Application Crashes/Instability (Medium Severity):** Prevents issues from processing invalid data saved via `magicalrecord`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption: Medium Impact:** Reduces risk of data corruption in Core Data managed by `magicalrecord`.
    *   **Injection Attacks: Medium to High Impact:** Significantly reduces injection risks related to data saved via `magicalrecord`.
    *   **Application Crashes/Instability: Medium Impact:** Improves stability by preventing issues from invalid data saved by `magicalrecord`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic UI input validation in some areas.
    *   Location: UI View Controllers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive input validation is not implemented *before* saving data using `magicalrecord`.
    *   Input sanitization is not consistently applied before `magicalrecord` saves.
    *   Location: Data access layers, business logic, wherever data is processed before `magicalrecord` save operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated with MagicalRecord Library](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated_with_magicalrecord_library.md)

*   **Description:**
