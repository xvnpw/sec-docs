*   **Attack Surface:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions that are then executed on the server.
    *   **How Mantle Contributes:** If Mantle's templating engine (or its integration) allows for the execution of arbitrary code within template syntax (e.g., through insecure variable interpolation or custom template functions provided by Mantle), it directly introduces this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A template uses a Mantle-provided function to render user input like `{{ render_unsafe(user.comment) }}`. An attacker enters `{{ system('whoami') }}` as their comment, which could be executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, remote code execution, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Avoid using template features that allow for raw code execution. Ensure Mantle's templating engine is configured to escape output by default. If Mantle provides custom template functions, rigorously audit them for security vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Rendering
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages that are then executed in the browsers of other users.
    *   **How Mantle Contributes:** If Mantle's templating engine does not properly escape output when rendering data (especially user-generated content) in templates, and Mantle doesn't provide clear and enforced mechanisms for developers to ensure proper escaping, it directly contributes to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A template displays a user's name using a Mantle helper function: `<h1>Hello, {{ mantle_unescaped(user.name) }}</h1>`. If `user.name` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this script will be executed in the victim's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account hijacking, session theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Utilize Mantle's built-in escaping mechanisms for template output. Ensure developers are aware of and consistently use these mechanisms. Avoid using "unescaped" or "raw" output functions unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

*   **Attack Surface:** Middleware Bypass
    *   **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent security checks implemented in middleware.
    *   **How Mantle Contributes:** If Mantle's middleware system has inherent flaws in its execution order logic, configuration options that are easily misused to create bypasses, or if Mantle provides mechanisms to conditionally skip middleware based on easily manipulated request data, it directly contributes to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** Mantle's middleware configuration allows defining conditions based on request headers. An attacker crafts a request with a specific header value to bypass an authentication middleware.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, bypassing security controls, potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Carefully define the order and scope of middleware execution using Mantle's configuration. Avoid relying on client-provided data for conditional middleware execution. Thoroughly test middleware configurations to ensure they cannot be bypassed.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Default Configurations
    *   **Description:** The framework ships with default settings that are not secure.
    *   **How Mantle Contributes:** If Mantle has insecure default configurations out-of-the-box (e.g., weak default encryption keys for sessions managed by Mantle, debug mode enabled by default in what might be perceived as production environments), applications built on it will inherit these vulnerabilities unless explicitly overridden.
    *   **Example:** Mantle's default session management configuration uses a weak encryption algorithm, making session hijacking easier without any explicit action from the developer.
    *   **Impact:**  Various security vulnerabilities depending on the specific insecure default (e.g., session hijacking, unauthorized access).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Review Mantle's default configurations and explicitly override any insecure settings with strong, secure values. Mantle's documentation should clearly highlight secure configuration practices and potential pitfalls of default settings.
