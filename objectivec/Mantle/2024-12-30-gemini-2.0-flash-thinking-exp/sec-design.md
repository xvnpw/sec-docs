## 2. Project Overview

Mantle is a modular blockchain SDK built upon the robust foundation of the Cosmos SDK. It empowers developers to construct bespoke blockchain applications with a strong emphasis on interoperability and a streamlined developer experience. The SDK's modular nature allows developers to assemble their blockchain by selecting and configuring a diverse range of modules, each providing distinct and specialized functionalities. This composable architecture promotes flexibility and customization.

### 3.1. Key Components

*   **Client Application:** Represents any external entity (e.g., a web browser, a mobile app, a command-line tool) that initiates interactions with the Mantle blockchain.
*   **Mantle API (gRPC/REST):** Serves as the primary entry point for external communication. It exposes gRPC and RESTful endpoints, enabling clients to submit transactions, query the blockchain's state, and engage with its functionalities.
*   **Core Mantle SDK (Cosmos SDK):**  The foundational layer of the blockchain application, built directly upon the Cosmos SDK. It manages the application's lifecycle, orchestrates transaction processing, and facilitates communication and coordination between the various modules.
*   **Modules:**  Independent, self-contained units of functionality that extend the blockchain's capabilities. Examples include:
    *   **Auth Module:**  Manages user accounts, authentication mechanisms, and authorization policies.
    *   **Bank Module:**  Handles the transfer of tokens, manages account balances, and enforces rules related to token economics.
    *   **Staking Module:**  Manages the staking of tokens by validators and delegators, contributing to network security and consensus participation.
    *   **Governance Module:**  Facilitates on-chain governance processes, allowing token holders to propose and vote on protocol changes.
    *   **Custom Module 1...N:** Represents the ability for developers to create and integrate their own modules to implement specific business logic and functionalities tailored to their application's needs.
*   **ABCI Interface (Application Blockchain Interface):**  The crucial communication bridge between the application logic (Mantle SDK and its modules) and the underlying consensus engine (Tendermint). It defines the standard methods for transaction delivery, state updates, and querying the application's state.
*   **Tendermint Consensus Engine:**  A robust, high-performance Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus engine responsible for ordering transactions into blocks and ensuring agreement on the blockchain's state across all participating nodes.
*   **State Database:**  The persistent storage mechanism for the current state of the blockchain, encompassing account balances, smart contract data (if applicable), and other persistent information crucial to the application's operation.
*   **External Blockchain/Service:** Represents interactions with other independent blockchains or external services, often facilitated through protocols like IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) or custom-built bridge solutions.
*   **Oracle Service:** Represents external data providers that supply real-world information to the blockchain, enabling smart contracts and applications to react to off-chain events and data.

## 4. Component Details

### 4.1. Mantle API (gRPC/REST)

*   **Functionality:**
    *   Accepts and processes incoming requests from client applications.
    *   Performs initial validation of incoming requests to ensure data integrity and format compliance.
    *   Translates external requests into internal commands that the Core Mantle SDK can understand and process.
    *   Constructs and returns appropriate responses to client applications, indicating the outcome of their requests.
*   **Technology:** Typically implemented using high-performance gRPC frameworks and standard RESTful API design principles.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Rigorous input validation to prevent various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).

    *   Implementing robust access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and modification of the database.
    *   Regularly performing backups and establishing reliable recovery mechanisms to mitigate data loss in case of failures.

## 5. Data Flow

A typical transaction flow within the Mantle blockchain can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant "Client Application" as Client
    participant "Mantle API" as API
    participant "Core Mantle SDK" as SDK
    participant "Auth Module" as Auth
    participant "Bank Module" as Bank
    participant "Tendermint" as Tendermint
    participant "State Database" as DB

    Client->>API: Submit Transaction (e.g., Send Tokens)
    API->>SDK: Route Transaction (MsgSend)
    SDK->>Auth: Authenticate Transaction (Verify Signature, Nonce)
    Auth-->>SDK: Authentication Result (Success/Failure)
    alt Authentication Success
        SDK->>Bank: Execute Bank Logic (Deduct Sender, Credit Receiver)
        Bank->>DB: Update State (Account Balances)
        DB-->>Bank: State Update Confirmation
        Bank-->>SDK: Execution Result (Success)
    else Authentication Failure
        SDK-->>API: Error Response (Unauthorized)
        API-->>Client: Error
    end
    SDK->>Tendermint: Deliver Transaction (ABCI - DeliverTx)
    Tendermint->>Tendermint: Consensus Process (Propose, Prevote, Precommit)
    Tendermint->>SDK: Begin Block (ABCI - BeginBlock)
    SDK->>Bank: Execute End Block Logic (e.g., Reward Distribution)
    SDK->>Tendermint: Commit State (ABCI - Commit)
    Tendermint->>DB: Persist Block and State Changes
    Tendermint-->>Client: Transaction Confirmation (Included in Block)
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1. A client application initiates a transaction, such as sending tokens, and submits it to the Mantle API.
2. The Mantle API receives the transaction and forwards it to the Core Mantle SDK, identifying the intended action (e.g., `MsgSend`).
3. The Core Mantle SDK routes the transaction to the appropriate module(s), starting with the Auth Module for authentication.
4. The Auth Module verifies the transaction's signature and nonce to ensure its authenticity and prevent replay attacks.
5. If authentication is successful, the Core Mantle SDK proceeds to the Bank Module to execute the token transfer logic.
6. The Bank Module interacts with the State Database to update the account balances of the sender and receiver.
7. The State Database confirms the state update to the Bank Module.
8. The Bank Module reports the successful execution back to the Core Mantle SDK.
9. If authentication fails, an error response is returned to the client.
10. The Core Mantle SDK then relays the transaction to the Tendermint consensus engine via the ABCI interface's `DeliverTx` method.
11. Tendermint initiates its consensus process, involving proposing, prevoting, and precommitting the block containing the transaction.
12. Once consensus is reached, Tendermint informs the Core Mantle SDK to begin the new block via the ABCI's `BeginBlock` method.
13. The Core Mantle SDK may trigger end-of-block logic in various modules, such as reward distribution in the Bank or Staking modules.
14. The Core Mantle SDK signals Tendermint to commit the block via the ABCI's `Commit` method.
15. Tendermint persists the new block and the associated state changes to the State Database.
16. Finally, the client application receives confirmation that the transaction has been successfully included in a block on the blockchain.
