## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Aspects](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_aspects.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Aspect Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_aspect_configuration.md)

This node is critical because gaining control over how aspects are defined and registered allows attackers to introduce malicious code or manipulate the application's behavior at a fundamental level.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Aspect Injection](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_aspect_injection.md)

This path involves the attacker successfully introducing their own malicious aspects into the application. This could be achieved by:
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the mechanism used to register aspects.
    *   Compromising the application's environment before Aspects is initialized.
    *   Through social engineering or an insider threat.
    Success in this path grants the attacker significant control over the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering/Insider Threat](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineeringinsider_threat.md)

This path highlights the risk posed by malicious insiders or attackers who can manipulate individuals with access to the application's development or deployment processes. This can lead to the direct introduction of malicious aspects or the compromise of existing ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Aspect Options](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_aspect_options.md)

This path focuses on the misuse of the various options provided by the `Aspects` library. Attackers can leverage these options to achieve unintended and malicious side effects, such as bypassing security checks or altering the intended functionality of methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Aspect Options for Unintended Side Effects](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_aspect_options_for_unintended_side_effects.md)

This node is critical because it highlights the danger of misusing the intended features of the `Aspects` library. Attackers can leverage options to bypass security checks or alter core functionality easily.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Aspect Priority](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_aspect_priority.md)

This path involves the attacker registering aspects with a higher priority than legitimate aspects. This allows the attacker's code to execute first, enabling them to intercept and potentially modify the behavior of critical methods before the intended logic is executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Register Aspects with High Priority to Intercept Critical Methods First](./attack_tree_paths/register_aspects_with_high_priority_to_intercept_critical_methods_first.md)

This node is critical because it allows attackers to position their malicious code to execute before legitimate code, enabling them to intercept and manipulate sensitive operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Block Execution Context](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_block_execution_context.md)

This node is critical because it focuses on the execution of code within the aspect blocks. Gaining control here allows attackers to execute arbitrary code within the application's process.

This path encompasses the various ways an attacker can leverage the execution context of aspect blocks to achieve malicious goals. This includes:
    *   Injecting malicious code directly into the blocks.
    *   Manipulating the data passed to the blocks to influence their behavior.
    *   Exploiting any unintended side effects resulting from the execution of the blocks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Aspect Blocks](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_aspect_blocks.md)

This node is critical as it represents a direct path to arbitrary code execution. By injecting malicious code into aspect blocks, attackers can gain complete control when those aspects are triggered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data Passed to Aspect Blocks](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_passed_to_aspect_blocks.md)

This node is critical because controlling the input to aspect blocks allows attackers to influence the block's behavior, potentially triggering vulnerabilities or altering the application's logic.
