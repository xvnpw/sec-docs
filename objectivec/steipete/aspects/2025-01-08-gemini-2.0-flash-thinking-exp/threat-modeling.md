# Threat Model Analysis for steipete/aspects

## Threat: [Malicious Aspect Injection](./threats/malicious_aspect_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Aspect Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application (e.g., code injection, insecure deserialization) to directly use `Aspects` functions like `aspect_addWithBlock:` to inject a malicious aspect into the runtime. The attacker crafts the aspect to intercept specific method calls using Aspects' capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** The injected aspect can perform arbitrary actions, such as stealing sensitive data from method arguments or return values accessed through Aspects' interception mechanisms, modifying application behavior for malicious purposes (e.g., bypassing security checks by altering method outcomes via Aspects), or causing a denial of service by injecting resource-intensive aspects using Aspects' API.
    *   **Affected Aspects Component:** `aspect_addWithBlock:` (and similar aspect addition functions), `AspectIdentifier` (representing the injected aspect), Aspects' method interception mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent code injection vulnerabilities that could be used to call Aspects' API.
        *   Secure deserialization processes to avoid injecting malicious objects that could directly interact with Aspects.
        *   Employ strong access controls to limit the ability to call Aspects' functions that modify the application's runtime environment.
        *   Regularly audit the application for potential injection points that could be leveraged to inject aspects.

## Threat: [Security Check Bypass via Aspect Modification](./threats/security_check_bypass_via_aspect_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Security Check Bypass via Aspect Modification
    *   **Description:** An attacker directly uses `Aspects` to inject an aspect targeting methods responsible for security checks (e.g., authentication, authorization). The aspect, added via Aspects' API, is designed to alter the method's behavior by manipulating the execution flow or return values through Aspects' interception capabilities, forcing it to return a successful result regardless of the actual check outcome.
    *   **Impact:** Successful bypass of security mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities. The attacker could gain elevated privileges or access sensitive data due to the direct manipulation enabled by Aspects.
    *   **Affected Aspects Component:** `aspect_addWithBlock:`, Aspects' method interception mechanism, the specific methods implementing security checks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid relying solely on method return values for critical security decisions, recognizing that Aspects can manipulate these. Implement defense-in-depth strategies that are harder to bypass with simple method interception.
        *   Make security checks as difficult to intercept and modify as possible, although this is inherently challenging with dynamic swizzling libraries like Aspects.
        *   Consider alternative security implementations that are less susceptible to runtime manipulation by libraries like Aspects.
        *   Monitor application behavior for unexpected outcomes of security checks that might indicate malicious aspect injection.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation through Aspect Interception](./threats/data_manipulation_through_aspect_interception.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Manipulation through Aspect Interception
    *   **Description:** An attacker directly utilizes `Aspects` to inject an aspect to intercept method calls that handle sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, financial information). Using Aspects' interception features, the aspect modifies the arguments passed to the method or the return value, potentially corrupting data or redirecting it to malicious destinations.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised data integrity, potential financial loss, privacy breaches, and incorrect application state due to the direct data manipulation facilitated by Aspects.
    *   **Affected Aspects Component:** `aspect_addWithBlock:`, Aspects' method interception mechanism, methods processing sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong data validation and sanitization within the original methods to detect and prevent unexpected data, even if Aspects is used to modify it.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to minimize the impact of potential interception and modification via Aspects.
        *   Use secure storage mechanisms for sensitive information, recognizing that Aspects could potentially bypass standard access controls.
        *   Regularly audit data processing flows for potential manipulation points that could be exploited using Aspects.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Malicious Aspect Block](./threats/code_injection_via_malicious_aspect_block.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Injection via Malicious Aspect Block
    *   **Description:** If there are vulnerabilities in how the `Aspects` library handles the execution of the blocks provided to `aspect_addWithBlock:`, an attacker might be able to craft a malicious block that executes arbitrary code within the application's context. This would be a direct vulnerability within the `Aspects` library itself or its interaction with the Objective-C runtime when handling aspect blocks.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal data, or perform other malicious actions due to a flaw in how Aspects processes aspect code.
    *   **Affected Aspects Component:** `aspect_addWithBlock:`, the internal mechanisms within the Aspects library for executing aspect blocks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if such a vulnerability exists within the Aspects library)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `Aspects` library updated to benefit from security patches addressing potential vulnerabilities in block handling.
        *   Carefully review the source code of the `Aspects` library for potential vulnerabilities (if feasible) related to block execution.
        *   Be extremely cautious about the source of any code that adds aspects to the application, as malicious blocks could be introduced this way.
