# Attack Surface Analysis for steipete/aspects

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Aspect Injection/Modification via Configuration](./attack_surfaces/malicious_aspect_injectionmodification_via_configuration.md)

* **How Aspects Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `aspects` relies on configuration to define which methods are advised and what code the aspects execute. If this configuration is sourced from untrusted or poorly secured locations, attackers can inject or modify aspects. This directly leverages the core functionality of `aspects`.
    * **Example:** An application loads aspect configurations from a YAML file accessible via a web path without authentication. An attacker modifies this file to inject an aspect that executes arbitrary code upon a specific method call.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the source of aspect configurations (e.g., use internal storage, require authentication for access).
        * Implement strict validation and sanitization of aspect configurations before loading.
        * Use a secure configuration management system.
        * Consider using compile-time or build-time aspect weaving where configuration is less dynamic.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities within Aspect Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_within_aspect_code.md)

* **How Aspects Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Aspects are custom code executed directly due to the `aspects` library's interception mechanism. If this code contains vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, path traversal, insecure deserialization), these vulnerabilities can be triggered through the normal execution flow of the advised methods, directly enabled by the aspect's presence.
    * **Example:** An aspect logs the arguments of a method call without proper sanitization. If an argument contains shell metacharacters, it could lead to command injection when the log is processed.
    * **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability within the aspect code, potentially ranging from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Apply secure coding practices when developing aspects.
        * Perform thorough code reviews and security testing of aspect code.
        * Treat aspect code with the same security rigor as core application code.
        * Avoid performing complex or security-sensitive operations directly within aspects if possible. Delegate to well-tested components.

## Attack Surface: [Aspects Bypassing Intended Security Checks](./attack_surfaces/aspects_bypassing_intended_security_checks.md)

* **How Aspects Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `aspects`' ability to execute code before, after, or around target methods allows for the circumvention of security measures. A malicious aspect can manipulate the execution flow or data in a way that causes security checks to be ineffective, a direct consequence of the aspect's interception point.
    * **Example:** An aspect applied "before" an authorization check modifies the user context to appear authorized, allowing unauthorized access to a protected resource.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully consider the order of aspect execution and its impact on security checks.
        * Design security checks to be resilient to aspect interference.
        * Implement robust testing to ensure aspects do not inadvertently bypass security measures.
        * Avoid applying aspects to core security-related methods unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Aspect Execution (High Severity Scenario)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_aspect_execution__high_severity_scenario_.md)

* **How Aspects Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `aspects` library grants aspects access to method arguments and return values. If an aspect, due to its design or a vulnerability, logs or transmits highly sensitive information without proper safeguards, it directly leads to information disclosure enabled by the library's access provision.
    * **Example:** An aspect, intended for debugging, logs the complete request and response objects, including sensitive personal data and authentication tokens, to a file or external system with insufficient access controls.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of highly sensitive information, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or significant privacy breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid logging or transmitting highly sensitive data within aspects.
        * Implement strict access controls and encryption for any logs or data handled by aspects.
        * Regularly audit aspect code for potential information leakage vulnerabilities.
        * Minimize the data accessible to aspects by design.

## Attack Surface: [Aspect Interference Leading to Security Vulnerabilities (High Severity Scenario)](./attack_surfaces/aspect_interference_leading_to_security_vulnerabilities__high_severity_scenario_.md)

* **How Aspects Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By modifying the execution flow or data of target methods, aspects can introduce new security vulnerabilities. This interference is a direct consequence of the `aspects` library's ability to alter method behavior.
    * **Example:** An aspect modifies the parameters of a database query in a way that introduces an SQL injection vulnerability, even if the original method was secure.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of new security vulnerabilities, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other significant security incidents.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Design aspects to be minimally invasive and focused on their intended purpose.
        * Implement thorough testing, including security testing, to ensure aspects do not introduce vulnerabilities.
        * Clearly define the scope and limitations of each aspect.
        * Employ static analysis tools to identify potential security issues in aspect code.
