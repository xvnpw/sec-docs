# Attack Surface Analysis for steipete/aspects

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of Security Controls](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_security_controls.md)

  **Description:**  Attackers circumvent authentication, authorization, or other security mechanisms implemented in the application.
    *   **How `aspects` Contributes:**  `aspects` allows modification of method execution flow.  Maliciously injected or modified aspects can intercept and bypass security checks *before* they are executed by the original code.
    *   **Example:**  An aspect is injected that intercepts the `authenticate_user()` method.  The injected aspect always returns `True`, regardless of the provided credentials, effectively disabling authentication.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality; complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Integrity:**  Implement robust code signing and verification to prevent unauthorized modification of application code and aspect definitions.  Use a strong Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to manage dependencies and ensure their integrity.
        *   **Configuration Hardening:**  If aspects are configured externally, secure configuration files with strict access controls and integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures).
        *   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  Employ RASP techniques to detect and prevent unauthorized aspect injection or modification at runtime.
        *   **Input Validation (within Aspects):** Even within aspects, validate any input data used to make decisions, to prevent injection attacks *within* the aspect itself.

## Attack Surface: [Data Modification/Corruption](./attack_surfaces/data_modificationcorruption.md)

    **Description:**  Attackers alter data in transit or at rest, leading to data integrity violations.
    *   **How `aspects` Contributes:**  Aspects can intercept method calls and modify arguments or return values.  This allows attackers to tamper with data before it's processed or stored.
    *   **Example:**  An aspect intercepts the `save_user_data()` method and modifies the `user_data` argument to include malicious content or overwrite existing data with incorrect values.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption, incorrect application behavior, potential for further exploitation (e.g., injecting XSS payloads).
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data handled by aspects, both input arguments and return values.  Use a defense-in-depth approach, validating data at multiple points.
        *   **Data Integrity Checks:**  Implement data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, hashes) to detect unauthorized modifications.  These checks should be performed *outside* of the potentially compromised aspects.
        *   **Aspect Interaction Analysis:**  Carefully analyze the interactions between multiple aspects to identify potential data corruption scenarios.  Document the expected data flow and transformations.
        *   **Immutable Data Structures (where applicable):** Consider using immutable data structures within aspects to reduce the risk of unintended modification.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure.md)

    **Description:**  Attackers gain access to sensitive information that should be protected.
    *   **How `aspects` Contributes:**  Aspects can access method arguments, return values, and internal state.  Malicious or poorly designed aspects can log, transmit, or otherwise expose this sensitive data.
    *   **Example:**  An aspect intended for debugging logs all arguments passed to the `process_payment()` method, including credit card numbers and CVV codes.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data (PII, credentials, financial information), leading to privacy violations, identity theft, and financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization:**  Minimize the amount of sensitive data accessed and processed by aspects.  Avoid logging or exposing sensitive data unnecessarily.
        *   **Data Sanitization and Redaction:**  Sanitize or redact sensitive data before logging or transmitting it.  Use appropriate masking techniques.
        *   **Secure Logging Practices:**  Implement secure logging practices, including secure storage, access control, and encryption of log files.
        *   **Conditional Logic:**  Use conditional logic within aspects to control when and what data is logged or exposed, based on the environment (e.g., production vs. development) and user roles.
        * **Audit Logging of Aspect Activity:** Log the actions performed by aspects themselves, to help detect and investigate potential information disclosure incidents.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation.md)

    **Description:** Attackers gain higher privileges than they are authorized to have.
    *   **How `aspects` Contributes:** If an aspect executes with higher privileges than the code it advises, a vulnerability in the aspect could be exploited to gain those higher privileges.
    *   **Example:** An aspect that interacts with the file system with administrator privileges is injected.  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the aspect to write arbitrary files to the system, potentially overwriting critical system files or installing malware.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that aspects run with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  Avoid granting unnecessary permissions.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Consider running aspects in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions. This is a more advanced, but effective, mitigation.
        *   **Code Review (with Privilege Focus):**  Pay close attention to the privileges required by aspects during code reviews.  Question any requests for elevated permissions.
        *   **Context-Aware Aspects:** Design aspects to be aware of the context in which they are executing (e.g., the user's role, the current operation) and adjust their behavior accordingly.
