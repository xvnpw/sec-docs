# Threat Model Analysis for steipete/aspects

## Threat: [Malicious Aspect Injection](./threats/malicious_aspect_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Aspect Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker successfully introduces a new, malicious aspect into the application.  This requires exploiting a vulnerability that allows them to inject code (e.g., compromised dependency, code upload flaw, direct codebase access). The injected aspect can then execute arbitrary code within the context of the targeted join points.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service, privilege escalation â€“ the impact is limited only by the attacker's code and the targeted join points.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `aspects` library's core mechanisms for applying aspects (e.g., `@aspect` decorator, `weave` function, dynamic loading mechanisms). Also, any configuration or storage used for aspect definitions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Codebase Access Control:** Implement rigorous access control to the codebase and any configuration files.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a robust dependency management system with hash checking and regular audits.
        *   **Input Validation (if applicable):** If aspects are loaded dynamically, implement *extremely* strict input validation and sanitization. Avoid dynamic loading if possible.
        *   **Read-Only Filesystem:** Deploy application code (including aspects) on a read-only filesystem.

## Threat: [Aspect Modification (Tampering)](./threats/aspect_modification__tampering_.md)

*   **Threat:** Aspect Modification (Tampering)

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies an existing, legitimate aspect to introduce malicious behavior. This requires write access to the codebase or a compromised dependency. The attacker subtly alters the aspect's code to achieve their goals, potentially remaining undetected for a longer period.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malicious injection, but potentially more insidious due to leveraging a trusted aspect. Can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, or subtle data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** The source code of existing aspects and any mechanisms for storing/loading aspect definitions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Codebase Access Control:** Strict access control is paramount.
        *   **Regular Code Audits:** Conduct frequent security audits, focusing on aspects.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement checksums or other integrity checks on aspect files.
        *   **Version Control:** Use a robust version control system and review all aspect changes.
        *   **Read-Only Filesystem:** Deploy aspects on a read-only filesystem.

## Threat: [Aspect Bypass (Security Check Evasion)](./threats/aspect_bypass__security_check_evasion_.md)

*   **Threat:** Aspect Bypass (Security Check Evasion)

    *   **Description:** An attacker circumvents security checks implemented as aspects. This involves manipulating the application's control flow to avoid join points where security aspects are applied or exploiting flaws in the aspect application logic itself.  For example, bypassing an authorization aspect by calling an unprotected method.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources or functionality, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Affected Component:** The join points where security-related aspects are applied; the application's overall control flow.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Defense in Depth:** Do *not* rely solely on aspects for critical security. Implement core security mechanisms independently.
        *   **Early Application:** Apply security aspects as early as possible in the request processing pipeline.
        *   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure *all* relevant entry points and methods are protected.
        *   **Testing for Bypass:** Specifically test for scenarios where aspects might be bypassed.

## Threat: [Aspect-Induced Data Leakage](./threats/aspect-induced_data_leakage.md)

*   **Threat:** Aspect-Induced Data Leakage

    *   **Description:** An aspect, intentionally or unintentionally, exposes sensitive data through logging, error messages, or by modifying return values. An aspect logging method calls might inadvertently log sensitive parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (credentials, PII, internal data), leading to privacy violations and potential further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any aspect that handles or has access to sensitive data, especially those involved in logging, error handling, or data transformation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization:** Aspects should only access necessary data.
        *   **Careful Logging:** Avoid logging sensitive data within aspects. Sanitize or redact if necessary.
        *   **Secure Error Handling:** Ensure error messages generated by aspects don't reveal sensitive information.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all aspects for potential data leaks.

## Threat: [Aspect-Based Privilege Escalation](./threats/aspect-based_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Threat:** Aspect-Based Privilege Escalation

    *   **Description:** An aspect with access to privileged operations is exploited to gain unauthorized access. If an aspect can perform actions like database queries or system calls, a vulnerability in that aspect could allow an attacker to execute those actions with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources; potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any aspect that interacts with privileged resources or performs privileged operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant aspects only the absolute minimum required privileges.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Rigorously review and secure the code of any aspect interacting with privileged resources.
        *   **Contextual Authorization:** Ensure privileged operations are performed only on behalf of a correctly authenticated and authorized user, within the appropriate context. Do *not* grant the aspect itself elevated privileges.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize any input to the aspect (even indirect input).
