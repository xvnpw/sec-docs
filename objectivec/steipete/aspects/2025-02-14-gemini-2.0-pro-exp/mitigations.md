# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for steipete/aspects

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Aspect Source Control and Review](./mitigation_strategies/strict_aspect_source_control_and_review.md)

**Description:**
1.  Store all aspect code in a dedicated, secure, version-controlled repository (e.g., a private Git repository).
2.  Establish a branch protection policy requiring at least one code review from a designated security reviewer *before* aspect code changes can be merged.
3.  The security reviewer should *specifically* examine the aspect code for:
    *   **Injection vulnerabilities:** Unsanitized input used in pointcut expressions or aspect logic.
    *   **Unintended side effects:** Interactions with other aspects or core code.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** Aspects modifying methods with higher privileges than the caller.
    *   **Denial-of-service:** Infinite loops, excessive resource consumption within the aspect.
    *   **Coding standards adherence:** Ensuring the aspect code itself is well-written and maintainable.
4.  Maintain an audit log of *all* aspect code changes (who, when, why).
5.  Regularly (e.g., quarterly) conduct a comprehensive security audit of *all* existing aspects.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification at Runtime (Severity: Critical):** Prevents malicious aspects.
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes (Severity: High):** Reduces subtle bugs from aspect interactions.
*   **Obfuscation of Control Flow (Severity: Medium):** Improves auditability of aspect changes.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirectly) (Severity: High):** Prevents aspects from gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Reduces aspects causing instability.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low).
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes:** Risk reduced (High to Medium).
*   **Obfuscation of Control Flow:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced (High to Medium).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Aspect code in a private Git repository.
*   Basic code reviews required.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No consistent, dedicated security reviewer for aspect code.
*   No regular, comprehensive security audits of existing aspects.
*   Audit log lacks sufficient detail (reasons for changes).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limited and Controlled Aspect Application](./mitigation_strategies/limited_and_controlled_aspect_application.md)

**Description:**
1.  Define pointcuts with *maximum* precision. Use specific class names, method names, and parameter types. *Avoid wildcards (`*`) and broad selectors*.
2.  Create a *whitelist* of approved aspects in a secure configuration file (e.g., `aspects_whitelist.yml`).  This file should be:
    *   Stored with restricted access (read-only for the application user).
    *   Digitally signed or checksummed to prevent tampering.
    *   Validated before use.
3.  The application should *only* load and apply aspects present in the whitelist.
4.  Log and *block* any attempt to load or apply an unapproved aspect.
5.  If possible, use *compile-time weaving* of aspects to reduce the runtime attack surface.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification at Runtime (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized aspects.
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes (Severity: High):** Limits the scope of aspect influence.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirectly) (Severity: High):** Restricts aspects modifying sensitive methods.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Makes it harder to inject resource-exhausting aspects.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low).
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes:** Risk reduced (High to Medium).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced (High to Medium).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Pointcuts are generally specific, but some wildcards are used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No whitelist of approved aspects.
*   No mechanism to prevent unapproved aspect application.
*   Compile-time weaving is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Within Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__within_aspects_.md)

**Description:**
1.  *Within each aspect*, before using method parameters or modifying return values, perform thorough validation and sanitization.
2.  **String parameters:**
    *   Check length.
    *   Validate against expected patterns (regex).
    *   Escape/encode special characters (HTML, SQL, JavaScript).
3.  **Numeric parameters:**
    *   Check valid ranges (min/max).
    *   Ensure correct data type.
4.  **Object parameters:**
    *   Validate object type.
    *   Check for nulls.
    *   Validate object fields if needed.
5.  If modifying a return value, ensure it adheres to the *same* validation rules as the original.
6.  Log *all* validation failures (aspect name, method name, invalid input).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification at Runtime (Severity: Critical):** Prevents injecting code via parameters.
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes (Severity: High):** Ensures aspects operate on valid data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents XSS if the aspect handles web data.
*   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents SQL injection if the aspect handles database queries.
*   **Other Injection Attacks (Severity: High/Critical):** Mitigates various injection attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low).
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes:** Risk reduced (High to Medium).
*   **XSS/SQL Injection/Other:** Risk significantly reduced (High/Critical to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some aspects have basic input validation, but it's inconsistent.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive validation/sanitization is missing in several aspects (especially those handling user data).
*   No centralized logging of validation failures within aspects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Aspect Configuration and Loading](./mitigation_strategies/secure_aspect_configuration_and_loading.md)

**Description:**
1.  If aspects are loaded dynamically, store files in a dedicated directory with *restricted access*. Only the application user should have *read* access; *no write access*.
2.  If a configuration file defines loaded aspects, it must also be stored securely with restricted access.
3.  *Before* loading the configuration file, *verify its integrity* using a checksum (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signature. Compare against a known good value.
4.  If the checksum/signature *doesn't match*, do *not* load the file and log an error.
5.  Implement robust error handling in the aspect loading mechanism:
    *   Log detailed errors.
    *   Do not crash or become unstable.
    *   Continue functioning (possibly with reduced functionality).
6.  *Never* allow aspects to be loaded or configured from *untrusted sources* (user input, external websites, uncontrolled network shares).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification at Runtime (Severity: Critical):** Prevents replacing aspect/config files with malicious versions.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents crashes from invalid aspect files.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low).
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced (High to Medium).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Aspect files are in a dedicated directory.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Access permissions are not sufficiently restrictive.
*   No checksum/signature validation.
*   Error handling in aspect loading is not robust.
*   Potential for loading from network shares (not currently done, but possible).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (for Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__for_aspects_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Identify the *specific* permissions each aspect needs.
2.  Grant *only* those permissions. Avoid broad permissions.
3.  If an aspect accesses a database, use a dedicated user account with *minimal* privileges (e.g., read-only to specific tables).
4.  If an aspect uses an external service, use a dedicated API key/service account with limited permissions.
5.  Regularly review and revoke unnecessary aspect permissions.
6.  Use a security context or sandbox (if available) to restrict aspect capabilities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirectly) (Severity: High):** Limits damage if an aspect is compromised.
*   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):** Reduces aspects accessing unneeded sensitive data.

**Impact:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Data Breaches:** Risk reduced (High to Medium).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No specific restrictions on aspect permissions.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Aspects run with the main application's excessive privileges.
*   No dedicated database users/API keys for aspects accessing external resources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Logging and Auditing (of Aspect Activity)](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_logging_and_auditing__of_aspect_activity_.md)

**Description:**
1.  Use a centralized logging system to capture *all* relevant aspect activity.
2.  For *each* aspect application, log:
    *   Aspect's fully qualified name.
    *   Target method's fully qualified name.
    *   Timestamp.
    *   Method parameter values (after validation/sanitization).
    *   Modifications to the return value.
    *   Exceptions/errors within the aspect's code.
3.  Log messages should be:
    *   Clear and concise.
    *   Include sufficient context.
    *   Consistently formatted.
4.  Store logs securely, with restricted access.
5.  Regularly review logs for suspicious activity:
    *   Unexpected aspect applications.
    *   Invalid input.
    *   Frequent errors.
6.  Implement alerts for critical events (failed aspect applications, security violations).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification at Runtime (Severity: Critical):** Provides an audit trail for malicious activity.
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes (Severity: High):** Helps diagnose the root cause.
*   **Obfuscation of Control Flow (Severity: Medium):** Improves understanding of execution flow.
*   **Data Breaches (Severity: High):** Can help identify unauthorized data access.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification:** Improves detection/investigation.
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes:** Improves diagnostics.
*   **Obfuscation of Control Flow:** Improves understanding.
*   **Data Breaches:** Improves detection/investigation.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic logging for some aspects, but not comprehensive/consistent.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No centralized logging for aspect activity.
*   Incomplete/inconsistent log messages.
*   No regular log review.
*   No alerts for critical events.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Testing Focused on Aspects](./mitigation_strategies/security_testing_focused_on_aspects.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Fuzzing:** Provide varied inputs (valid, invalid, boundary) to methods affected by aspects. Monitor for errors, crashes, or unexpected results.
2.  **Penetration Testing:** Simulate attacks targeting aspects:
    *   Injecting malicious aspects.
    *   Exploiting aspect logic vulnerabilities.
    *   Bypassing aspect-implemented security controls.
3.  **Static Analysis:** Use tools aware of AOP to find vulnerabilities in aspect code (unvalidated input, insecure API use, privilege escalation).
4.  **Dynamic Analysis:** Monitor aspect behavior at runtime to detect:
    *   Unexpected method calls.
    *   Memory issues.
    *   Security policy violations.
5.  Integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline for automatic testing with every code change.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **All identified threats (Severity: Varies):** Proactively identifies and fixes vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   **All Threats:** Significantly reduces vulnerability risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic unit tests for some aspects, but no security focus.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No fuzzing, penetration testing, static analysis, or dynamic analysis targeting aspects.
*   No security test integration into CI/CD.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fail-Safe Mechanisms](./mitigation_strategies/fail-safe_mechanisms.md)

**Description:**
1.  Implement a global "disable aspects" switch (config setting/environment variable) for quick disabling in emergencies.
2.  Implement a way to disable *individual* aspects (remove from whitelist, comment out in config).
3.  In aspects with resource-intensive operations (database queries, network requests), use *circuit breakers* or *rate limiting* to prevent resource exhaustion/DoS.
4.  Consider a "safe mode" that disables all non-essential aspects.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Limits the impact of resource-exhausting aspects.
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes (Severity: High):** Provides quick recovery from aspect-caused issues.
*   **Code Injection/Modification at Runtime (Severity: Critical):** Enables rapid response to malicious aspects.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
*   **Unexpected Behavior Changes:** Improves recovery time/reduces impact.
*   **Code Injection/Modification:** Improves response time/limits damage.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No mechanisms to quickly disable aspects.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No global "disable aspects" switch.
*   No easy way to disable individual aspects.
*   No circuit breakers/rate limiting.
*   No "safe mode."
