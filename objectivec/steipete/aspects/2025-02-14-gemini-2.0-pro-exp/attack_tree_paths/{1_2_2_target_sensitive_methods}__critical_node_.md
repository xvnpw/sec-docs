# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Target Sensitive Methods (1.2.2)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the risks associated with an attacker targeting sensitive methods within an application that utilizes the Aspects library (https://github.com/steipete/aspects) for aspect-oriented programming (AOP).  We aim to understand how an attacker might exploit Aspects to hook into these methods, the potential consequences, and effective mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform specific security recommendations for the development team.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack tree path node **1.2.2: Target Sensitive Methods**.  The scope includes:

*   **Aspects Library:**  Understanding how Aspects works, its capabilities, and its limitations in the context of security.  We'll assume the attacker has a good understanding of Aspects.
*   **Application Codebase:**  We'll consider the hypothetical application's codebase, focusing on identifying potential "sensitive methods."  This includes methods related to:
    *   **Authentication:**  User login, password reset, session management.
    *   **Authorization:**  Access control checks, role-based permissions.
    *   **Data Access:**  Database queries, file system operations, interactions with external services that handle sensitive data.
    *   **System Administration:**  Configuration changes, user management, system-level operations.
    *   **Financial Transactions:** Payment processing, balance updates.
    *   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Handling:** Any method that reads, writes, or processes PII.
*   **Attack Surface:**  We'll consider scenarios where an attacker has already gained some level of access, enabling them to inject or modify code that uses Aspects. This might be through:
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party library to inject malicious code.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If the application is a web application and vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could inject JavaScript that leverages Aspects (if Aspects is used on the client-side).
    *   **Code Injection:**  Directly injecting code into the application's codebase (e.g., through a compromised development environment or a server-side vulnerability).
    *   **Malicious Package:**  Tricking the developers into installing a malicious package that hooks into sensitive methods using Aspects.

*   **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover:
    *   Vulnerabilities in the Aspects library itself (we assume the library is functioning as designed).
    *   Attacks that do not involve leveraging Aspects for method hooking.
    *   Physical security or social engineering attacks.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Aspects Review:**  Re-familiarize ourselves with the Aspects library's documentation and functionality, paying close attention to how selectors work and how aspects are applied.
2.  **Hypothetical Codebase Analysis:**  Construct hypothetical code examples that represent common patterns in the application, including examples of sensitive methods.
3.  **Attack Scenario Development:**  Develop realistic attack scenarios where an attacker could use Aspects to target the identified sensitive methods.  This will involve crafting malicious aspects.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  For each attack scenario, assess the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations in the original attack tree description and propose additional, more specific mitigations.
6.  **Code Example (Illustrative):** Provide illustrative code examples (likely in Objective-C, given Aspects' focus) to demonstrate both vulnerable code and potential mitigations.

### 4.1. Aspects Review (Refresher)

Aspects allows developers to add behavior to existing methods without modifying the original code.  Key concepts:

*   **Aspect:**  A piece of code that defines the *advice* (the code to be executed) and the *pointcut* (the set of methods to which the advice should be applied).
*   **Pointcut (Selector):**  In Aspects, pointcuts are defined using method selectors.  These selectors can be very specific (targeting a single method) or more general (using wildcards or matching patterns).  This is the *crucial* point for this vulnerability.
*   **Advice:**  The code that will be executed *before*, *after*, or *instead of* the original method.  This is where the attacker's malicious code would reside.
*   **Join Point:**  A specific point in the execution of the program where an aspect can be applied (e.g., a method call).

### 4.2. Hypothetical Codebase Analysis

Let's consider a simplified example of a banking application:

```objectivec
// BankAccount.h
@interface BankAccount : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *accountNumber;
@property (nonatomic, assign) double balance;

- (BOOL)withdraw:(double)amount;
- (void)deposit:(double)amount;
- (BOOL)transfer:(double)amount toAccount:(BankAccount *)targetAccount;
- (BOOL)authenticateWithPIN:(NSString *)pin; // Sensitive method
- (void)updateBalanceInDatabase; // Sensitive method
@end

// BankAccount.m
@implementation BankAccount

- (BOOL)withdraw:(double)amount {
    if (self.balance >= amount) {
        self.balance -= amount;
        [self updateBalanceInDatabase]; // Sensitive operation
        return YES;
    }
    return NO;
}

- (void)deposit:(double)amount {
    self.balance += amount;
    [self updateBalanceInDatabase]; // Sensitive operation
}

- (BOOL)transfer:(double)amount toAccount:(BankAccount *)targetAccount {
    if ([self withdraw:amount]) {
        [targetAccount deposit:amount];
        return YES;
    }
    return NO;
}

- (BOOL)authenticateWithPIN:(NSString *)pin {
    // Simulate PIN verification (in reality, this would involve secure storage and comparison)
    return [pin isEqualToString:@"1234"]; // **Highly insecure for demonstration purposes!**
}

- (void)updateBalanceInDatabase {
    // Simulate database update (in reality, this would involve secure database interactions)
    NSLog(@"Updating balance for account %@ to %f", self.accountNumber, self.balance);
}

@end
```

In this example, `authenticateWithPIN:` and `updateBalanceInDatabase` are clearly sensitive methods.  `withdraw:`, `deposit:`, and `transfer:toAccount:` are also sensitive because they directly manipulate the account balance.

### 4.3. Attack Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: Bypassing Authentication**

An attacker could inject the following aspect:

```objectivec
#import <Aspects/Aspects.h>
#import "BankAccount.h"

// ... (attacker's code injection point) ...

[BankAccount aspect_hookSelector:@selector(authenticateWithPIN:)
                      withOptions:AspectPositionInstead
                       usingBlock:^(id<AspectInfo> aspectInfo, NSString *pin) {
                           // Always return YES, bypassing the actual PIN check
                           return YES;
                       } error:NULL];
```

This aspect replaces the original `authenticateWithPIN:` method with a block that always returns `YES`, effectively disabling the PIN check.  The attacker could then call other methods that rely on authentication, such as `withdraw:`, without knowing the correct PIN.

**Scenario 2: Stealing Funds via `withdraw:`**

```objectivec
[BankAccount aspect_hookSelector:@selector(withdraw:)
                      withOptions:AspectPositionBefore
                       usingBlock:^(id<AspectInfo> aspectInfo, double amount) {
                           // Log the withdrawal amount and account number (or send it to an attacker-controlled server)
                           BankAccount *account = [aspectInfo instance];
                           NSLog(@"Withdrawal of %f from account %@", amount, account.accountNumber);
                           // Could also modify the 'amount' to a larger value here!
                       } error:NULL];
```
This aspect intercepts calls to `withdraw:`, logging the account number and withdrawal amount *before* the actual withdrawal takes place.  The attacker could use this information for later fraudulent activity.  More dangerously, the attacker could modify the `amount` parameter within the aspect to withdraw more funds than the user intended.

**Scenario 3: Manipulating `updateBalanceInDatabase`**
```objectivec
[BankAccount aspect_hookSelector:@selector(updateBalanceInDatabase)
                      withOptions:AspectPositionInstead
                       usingBlock:^(id<AspectInfo> aspectInfo) {
                           BankAccount *account = [aspectInfo instance];
                           //Do nothing, or update to attacker controlled value.
                           NSLog(@"Balance update prevented or manipulated for account %@", account.accountNumber);

                       } error:NULL];
```
This aspect intercepts calls to `updateBalanceInDatabase`, preventing the balance from being updated, or updating it to a value controlled by the attacker.

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

| Scenario                     | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Bypassing Authentication    | High            | High      | Medium       |
| Stealing Funds (Withdraw)   | High            | High      | Low          |
| Manipulating Database Update | Low             | High      | Medium       |

*   **Confidentiality:**  Attackers can gain access to sensitive information (account balances, transaction history, PINs if they are logged).
*   **Integrity:**  Attackers can modify data (account balances, transaction records) and bypass security controls (authentication).
*   **Availability:**  Attackers could potentially disrupt service by causing inconsistencies in the database or by triggering error conditions.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Recommendations

The original mitigations are a good starting point, but we need to be more specific:

1.  **Carefully review all selectors:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Implement a rigorous code review process that specifically examines all uses of `aspect_hookSelector:`.  Create a checklist of sensitive methods and ensure that no aspect targets them unintentionally.  Use automated tools to scan the codebase for calls to `aspect_hookSelector:` and flag any potential issues.
    *   **Example:**  A code review checklist might include: "Does this aspect target any methods related to authentication, authorization, data access, or system administration?"

2.  **Consider using a "deny-list" approach:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Create a list of sensitive method selectors that are *never* allowed to be hooked.  This list should be centrally managed and enforced through automated checks.  Before applying any aspect, check if the target selector is on the deny-list.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**

    ```objectivec
    NSArray *deniedSelectors = @[@"authenticateWithPIN:", @"updateBalanceInDatabase", /* ... */];

    BOOL isSelectorAllowed(SEL selector) {
        NSString *selectorName = NSStringFromSelector(selector);
        return ![deniedSelectors containsObject:selectorName];
    }

    // ... in the code that applies aspects ...
    if (isSelectorAllowed(targetSelector)) {
        [targetClass aspect_hookSelector:targetSelector withOptions:options usingBlock:block error:error];
    } else {
        // Log an error, throw an exception, or take other appropriate action
        NSLog(@"ERROR: Attempt to hook a denied selector: %@", NSStringFromSelector(targetSelector));
    }
    ```

3.  **Implement strong authorization checks within sensitive methods:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Even if a method is hooked, it should *still* perform its own authorization checks.  Don't rely solely on the caller being authorized.  This is a defense-in-depth strategy.
    *   **Example:**  Even if `withdraw:` is hooked, it should still verify that the current user has sufficient permissions to withdraw from the specified account.

4.  **Additional Recommendations:**

    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the code running Aspects has the minimum necessary privileges.  If possible, run Aspects-related code in a separate, less-privileged context.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all inputs to methods, *especially* those targeted by aspects.  This can help prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in the original method logic.
    *   **Auditing:**  Implement comprehensive auditing of all aspect-related activity.  Log when aspects are applied, which methods they target, and any changes they make.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities related to Aspects usage. These tools can help detect insecure selectors and potential code injection points.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., fuzzing) to test the application's behavior when aspects are applied, particularly with unexpected or malicious inputs.
    *   **Limit Aspects Usage:** If possible, restrict the use of Aspects to specific, well-defined use cases. Avoid using it for core security logic. Consider alternatives like delegation or subclassing if they provide sufficient flexibility without the risks of AOP.
    * **Code Signing and Integrity Checks:** If the application is deployed in an environment where code signing is possible (e.g., iOS), use it to ensure that only authorized code can be loaded and executed. This can help prevent attackers from injecting malicious aspects.
    * **Runtime Protection:** Consider using runtime application self-protection (RASP) tools. These tools can monitor the application's behavior at runtime and detect or prevent malicious activity, including attempts to hook sensitive methods.

### 4.6 Illustrative Code Example (Mitigation)
```objectivec
// BankAccount.m (with mitigations)
@implementation BankAccount

- (BOOL)withdraw:(double)amount {
    // Authorization check (even if hooked)
    if (![self isUserAuthorizedToWithdraw]) {
        return NO;
    }

    if (self.balance >= amount) {
        self.balance -= amount;
        [self updateBalanceInDatabase];
        return YES;
    }
    return NO;
}

- (BOOL)isUserAuthorizedToWithdraw {
 //Check user authorization
    return YES;
}

// ... other methods ...

@end
```

## 5. Conclusion

Targeting sensitive methods using Aspects is a high-risk attack vector.  By carefully reviewing selectors, implementing a deny-list, enforcing authorization checks within sensitive methods, and following the additional recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack.  Continuous monitoring, auditing, and security testing are essential to maintain a strong security posture. The combination of static analysis, dynamic analysis, code reviews, and a "deny-list" approach provides a robust defense against this attack vector.
