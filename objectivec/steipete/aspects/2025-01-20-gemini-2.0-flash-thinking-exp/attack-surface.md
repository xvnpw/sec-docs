# Attack Surface Analysis for steipete/aspects

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Aspect Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_aspect_injection.md)

* **Attack Surface: Malicious Aspect Injection**
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code disguised as an aspect, which then modifies the behavior of application methods at runtime.
    * **How Aspects Contributes:** Aspects provides the mechanism to dynamically alter method execution, making it a potential vector for injecting and activating malicious code. Without Aspects, this type of runtime modification would be significantly more difficult.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises a dependency or configuration file and injects an aspect that intercepts a payment processing method. This malicious aspect could then redirect payments to the attacker's account or steal credit card details.
    * **Impact:**  Data breaches, financial loss, unauthorized access, compromise of sensitive operations.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict control over dependencies and their integrity using tools like Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and dependency scanning.
        * Secure the configuration mechanisms used to define and apply aspects, ensuring only authorized personnel can modify them.
        * Employ code signing and verification for aspects if the library supports it or build a custom verification mechanism.
        * Regularly audit the applied aspects and their configurations in production environments.
        * Consider using a more restrictive approach to dynamic modification if the full flexibility of Aspects is not required.

## Attack Surface: [Aspect Chaining Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/aspect_chaining_exploitation.md)

* **Attack Surface: Aspect Chaining Exploitation**
    * **Description:** Attackers exploit the order in which multiple aspects are applied to a method to manipulate data or control flow in a harmful way.
    * **How Aspects Contributes:** Aspects allows for multiple aspects to be chained, and the order of execution can be crucial. This creates an opportunity for attackers to insert a malicious aspect at a strategic point in the chain.
    * **Example:** A legitimate security aspect sanitizes user input. An attacker injects a malicious aspect that executes *after* the sanitization, reintroducing malicious code before it reaches the core logic.
    * **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, data manipulation, unexpected application behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a clear and well-documented policy for aspect ordering and dependencies.
        * Design aspects to be independent and not rely on specific execution order where possible.
        * Implement robust testing that considers different aspect orderings and potential interactions.
        * Provide mechanisms to explicitly define and enforce the order of aspect execution if the library allows it.
        * Regularly review and audit the aspect chains applied to critical methods.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Aspect Logging](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_aspect_logging.md)

* **Attack Surface: Information Disclosure through Aspect Logging**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information is unintentionally logged or exposed through aspects used for logging or monitoring.
    * **How Aspects Contributes:** Aspects are often used for logging method calls and parameters. If not configured securely, this can lead to the exposure of sensitive data.
    * **Example:** An aspect logs the parameters of a user authentication method, including passwords, which are then stored in an insecure log file.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, privacy violations, compliance issues.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement secure logging practices, ensuring sensitive data is not logged or is properly anonymized/redacted.
        * Secure the logging infrastructure and access controls to prevent unauthorized access to logs.
        * Regularly review the logging configuration of aspects to ensure it aligns with security and privacy requirements.
        * Consider alternative methods for monitoring and debugging that minimize the risk of exposing sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Circumvention of Security Measures via Aspect Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/circumvention_of_security_measures_via_aspect_manipulation.md)

* **Attack Surface: Circumvention of Security Measures via Aspect Manipulation**
    * **Description:** Attackers use aspects to bypass or disable existing security checks and controls within the application.
    * **How Aspects Contributes:** Aspects can intercept and modify the behavior of security-related methods, effectively neutralizing them.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects an aspect that intercepts an authentication check and always returns "true," allowing unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, complete compromise of security controls.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Design security controls to be resilient against dynamic modification. Avoid relying solely on methods that can be easily intercepted by aspects.
        * Implement integrity checks for critical security components and their behavior.
        * Restrict the ability to apply aspects to security-critical methods.
        * Employ runtime integrity monitoring to detect unexpected modifications to security-related code.
