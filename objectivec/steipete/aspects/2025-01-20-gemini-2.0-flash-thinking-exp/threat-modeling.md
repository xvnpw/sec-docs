# Threat Model Analysis for steipete/aspects

## Threat: [Malicious Aspect Injection](./threats/malicious_aspect_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains the ability to inject their own, malicious aspects into the application's runtime environment by exploiting vulnerabilities in how `aspects` configurations are loaded, stored, or managed. This directly leverages the `aspects` library's mechanism for applying dynamic modifications. The attacker might manipulate configuration files that `aspects` reads, exploit insecure API endpoints responsible for aspect management within the `aspects` framework, or leverage vulnerabilities in how `aspects` integrates with the application's dependency management. Once injected via `aspects`, the malicious aspect can intercept method calls facilitated by `aspects` and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and denial of service. The attacker can manipulate application logic intercepted by `aspects`, steal sensitive information, or use the application as a platform for further attacks, all through the capabilities provided by `aspects`.

**Affected Component:** `aspects` library's aspect application logic, `aspects`' aspect definition loading mechanism, configuration management used by `aspects`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls for managing aspect configurations used by `aspects`.
* Securely store aspect definitions used by `aspects`, using encryption and integrity checks.
* Validate all inputs related to aspect definitions and application within the `aspects` framework.
* Regularly audit aspect configurations managed by `aspects` for unauthorized changes.
* Employ principle of least privilege for processes interacting with `aspects` for aspect management.

## Threat: [Aspect Code Tampering](./threats/aspect_code_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker modifies the code of existing, legitimate aspects managed by the `aspects` library. This could happen if the storage or retrieval mechanism for aspect code used by `aspects` is insecure. The attacker might gain access to the filesystem where `aspects` stores or retrieves aspect code or intercept the delivery of aspect code during runtime loading initiated by `aspects`. By altering the aspect's logic, the attacker can introduce malicious behavior that is executed whenever the `aspects` library applies that aspect.

**Impact:** Subtle or significant changes in application behavior, potentially leading to data corruption, security bypasses, or unexpected errors. The impact depends on the functionality of the tampered aspect managed by `aspects`.

**Affected Component:** `aspects` library's aspect code storage, `aspects`' aspect loading mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store aspect code used by `aspects` in a secure location with restricted access.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for aspect code managed by `aspects`.
* Use secure channels for delivering aspect code during runtime loading performed by `aspects`.
* Regularly verify the integrity of aspect code used by `aspects`.

## Threat: [Aspect-Based Security Bypass](./threats/aspect-based_security_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts or modifies aspects to bypass existing security checks within the application by leveraging the interception capabilities of the `aspects` library. This could involve creating aspects that intercept calls to authentication or authorization functions, which are then modified by `aspects`, and manipulate their return values, effectively granting unauthorized access. Alternatively, aspects managed by `aspects` could be used to disable input validation routines, allowing the injection of malicious data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, privilege escalation, and the ability to perform actions that should be restricted, all facilitated by the manipulation capabilities of `aspects`.

**Affected Component:** `aspects` library's aspect application logic, methods targeted by the malicious aspect (especially security-related methods intercepted by `aspects`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully audit the application of aspects managed by `aspects` to security-sensitive methods.
* Implement robust integration tests to ensure aspects applied by `aspects` do not inadvertently bypass security controls.
* Consider a policy-based approach to restrict the application of aspects by `aspects` to certain methods or classes.
* Employ runtime monitoring to detect unexpected modifications in the behavior of security-critical functions due to `aspects`.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Aspects Library](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_aspects_library.md)

**Description:** The `aspects` library itself contains vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. This is a direct risk stemming from the use of this third-party library.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the flaw within the `aspects` library.

**Affected Component:** The `aspects` library itself.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest versions of the `aspects` library and monitor for security advisories related to `aspects`.
* Consider the security posture and reputation of the maintainers of the `aspects` library.
* Evaluate alternative approaches if significant security concerns arise with the `aspects` library.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the `aspects` library.
