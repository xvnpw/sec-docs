## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Aspect](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_aspect.md)

This path represents the danger of introducing malicious code into the application through the Aspects mechanism.

* **Attack Vector: Compromise Dependency with Malicious Aspect (Critical Node)**
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of the application, including Aspects itself, and injects a malicious aspect. This could occur through a supply chain attack where a legitimate library is compromised.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Successful injection of a malicious aspect can grant the attacker complete control over the application's behavior, allowing for data theft, manipulation, or remote code execution.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Supply chain attacks are increasingly common and difficult to detect. The impact of a compromised dependency is severe.

* **Attack Vector: Exploit Dynamic Code Loading Vulnerability (Critical Node)**
    * **Description:** The application dynamically loads aspect definitions from an untrusted source, allowing an attacker to provide a malicious aspect definition.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Loading malicious code dynamically can lead to immediate remote code execution on the application server or client.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:**  Dynamic code loading from untrusted sources is a well-known security risk with severe consequences.

* **Attack Vector: Local File Inclusion/Write Vulnerability (Critical Node)**
    * **Description:** The application reads aspect definitions from a file, and an attacker can control the content of that file through a Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Local File Write (LFW) vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Critical. By controlling the aspect definition file, the attacker can inject malicious aspects, leading to remote code execution or other forms of compromise.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** LFI/LFW vulnerabilities are relatively common in web applications and provide a direct path to code injection when aspect definitions are read from files.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Logic Errors in Existing Aspects](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_logic_errors_in_existing_aspects.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the logic of already deployed aspects, particularly those related to security.

* **Attack Vector: Bypass Security Checks Implemented via Aspects (Critical Node)**
    * **Description:** Aspects are sometimes used to implement security checks (e.g., authorization, input validation). An attacker finds a way to manipulate the application's state or execution flow to bypass these security aspects.
    * **Impact:** High. Successfully bypassing security checks can grant unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:**  Security logic implemented in aspects, if not carefully designed and tested, can be vulnerable to bypass techniques, directly undermining the application's security posture.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Weaknesses in Aspect Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_weaknesses_in_aspect_configuration.md)

This path highlights the risks associated with insecure configuration of the Aspects library.

* **Attack Vector: Default or Weak Aspect Configurations (Critical Node)**
    * **Description:** The application uses default or poorly configured aspect settings that introduce vulnerabilities. This could include overly permissive logging, insecure interception points, or disabled security features.
    * **Impact:** Medium-High. The impact depends on the specific insecure configuration, but it can lead to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or other security weaknesses.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:**  Using default or weak configurations is a common oversight and easily exploitable.

* **Attack Vector: Insecure Storage of Aspect Configurations (Critical Node)**
    * **Description:** Aspect configurations are stored in a location or manner that is accessible to an attacker. This could include storing configuration files in publicly accessible directories or using weak encryption.
    * **Impact:** High. If an attacker can access and modify aspect configurations, they can alter the application's behavior, potentially injecting malicious logic or disabling security features.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:**  Insecure storage of sensitive configuration data is a significant vulnerability that can lead to direct compromise.

* **Attack Vector: Lack of Input Validation on Aspect Definitions (Critical Node)**
    * **Description:** The application does not properly validate aspect definitions before processing them. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code or commands within the aspect definitions.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Lack of input validation on code or configuration data can lead to remote code execution.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:**  Failing to validate input, especially when dealing with code or configuration, is a fundamental security flaw with severe consequences.
