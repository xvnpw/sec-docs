**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Compromise Application via Aspects [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and serves as the root of the attack tree. Its criticality stems from the severe impact of achieving this objective.

*   **Exploit Direct Method Swizzling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   This path involves directly leveraging the method swizzling capabilities of Aspects to inject and execute malicious code. It's high-risk due to the potential for complete application compromise and critical because it's a primary entry point for many subsequent attacks.

*   **Inject Malicious Aspect Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the crucial step where the attacker manages to introduce malicious Aspect definitions into the application's runtime environment. Its criticality lies in the fact that successful code injection enables a wide range of subsequent attacks.

*   **Exploit Existing Code Injection Vulnerability (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Leverage known web app vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi, RCE) to inject code that uses Aspects:** This attack vector utilizes common web application vulnerabilities to inject code that then leverages the Aspects API to define and apply malicious aspects. It's high-risk due to the prevalence of these vulnerabilities and the severe impact of achieving code execution. It's a critical node as it's a frequent entry point for attackers.

*   **Manipulate Application Logic via Swizzled Methods [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific manipulation
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to High (depending on the manipulation)
    *   This path focuses on exploiting successfully injected malicious aspects to alter the intended behavior of the application. It's high-risk because it can lead to various damaging outcomes, including security bypasses, data breaches, and denial of service. It's a critical node as it represents the direct exploitation of Aspects' capabilities.

*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
    *   **Swizzle methods responsible for authentication or authorization checks to always return success:** By swizzling methods responsible for verifying user credentials or permissions, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application and its resources. This is a high-risk path due to the severe impact of unauthorized access and a critical node because it directly undermines core security mechanisms.

*   **Modify Data Processing/Validation (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Swizzle methods that handle data input, processing, or validation to inject malicious data or bypass security checks:** This allows attackers to manipulate data flowing through the application, potentially leading to data corruption, security bypasses, or the introduction of malicious content.

*   **Leak Sensitive Information (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
    *   **Swizzle methods that handle sensitive data to log, store, or transmit it to an attacker-controlled location:** This directly leads to the exposure of confidential information, resulting in a data breach.

*   **Cause Denial of Service (DoS) (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Swizzle methods to introduce infinite loops, excessive resource consumption, or application crashes:** By manipulating method behavior, an attacker can make the application unavailable to legitimate users, causing significant disruption.
