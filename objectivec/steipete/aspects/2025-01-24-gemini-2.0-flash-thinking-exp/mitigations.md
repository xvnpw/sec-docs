## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Security Audits for Aspects](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_security_audits_for_aspects.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Code Review and Security Audits for Aspects
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandate code reviews specifically for all code implementing aspects using the `Aspects` library.** This review should occur before merging aspect code into the main codebase.
    2.  **Develop security-focused checklists for aspect code reviews.** These checklists should address risks unique to aspect-oriented programming with `Aspects`, such as unintended method interception, unexpected side effects due to aspect weaving, and potential for misuse of aspect features.
    3.  **Involve security experts in reviewing aspect implementations,** particularly for aspects that modify security-sensitive application logic or handle sensitive data through method interception.
    4.  **Schedule regular security audits of all aspects implemented with `Aspects`.** These audits should be performed periodically (e.g., quarterly) and after any significant changes to the application or aspect implementations.
    5.  **Utilize static analysis tools capable of analyzing Objective-C/Swift code and aspect usage patterns.** These tools can help identify potential vulnerabilities or code quality issues within aspect implementations using `Aspects`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Aspect Injection (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of developers introducing malicious aspects via `Aspects` that could compromise application behavior through runtime method modification.
    *   **Vulnerable Aspect Implementation (High Severity):** Mitigates the risk of introducing aspects with coding errors within `Aspects` usage that could be exploited due to the dynamic nature of aspect weaving.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects from Aspects (Medium Severity):** Helps identify aspects implemented with `Aspects` that might have unintended and potentially harmful side effects on application behavior due to method interception and modification.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of introducing and deploying malicious or vulnerable aspects implemented using the `Aspects` library. Provides a proactive security layer specific to aspect-oriented programming risks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General code reviews might exist, but security-focused reviews specifically for `Aspects` usage and dedicated security expert involvement are likely missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal security audit schedule for aspects implemented with `Aspects`, security-focused checklists for `Aspects` code reviews, mandatory security expert review for critical aspects using `Aspects`, integration of static analysis tools for `Aspects` code analysis.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Aspect Execution](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_aspect_execution.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Aspect Execution
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze the necessary privileges for each aspect implemented with `Aspects` to function correctly.** Consider the methods intercepted, data accessed, and actions performed by each aspect.
    2.  **Ensure aspects implemented with `Aspects` operate with the minimum necessary permissions.** Avoid granting aspects broad or excessive privileges that could be abused if an aspect is compromised or misused through `Aspects`' runtime modification capabilities.
    3.  **Implement access control mechanisms to restrict aspect execution or the scope of method interception by aspects based on roles or contexts,** if applicable within the application's architecture and `Aspects`' capabilities.
    4.  **Regularly review and adjust the privileges required by aspects implemented with `Aspects`** as application requirements evolve, ensuring privileges remain minimal and aligned with the principle of least privilege in the context of aspect-oriented programming.
    5.  **Document the privileges required by each aspect implemented with `Aspects`** for clarity, maintainability, and security auditing purposes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Compromised Aspect (High Severity):** Limits the potential damage if an aspect implemented with `Aspects` is compromised, as the aspect will have restricted privileges due to the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Data Breach via Over-Privileged Aspect (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches if an aspect implemented with `Aspects` with excessive privileges is exploited or misused through the library's runtime modification features.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the potential impact of a compromised aspect implemented with `Aspects` by limiting its capabilities and access based on the principle of least privilege.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General principle of least privilege might be understood, but explicit application and enforcement specifically for aspects implemented with `Aspects` might be lacking.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal privilege analysis for each aspect using `Aspects`, implementation of access control mechanisms for aspects within `Aspects`' capabilities, documented privilege requirements for aspects using `Aspects`, automated checks to enforce least privilege for aspects implemented with `Aspects`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization within Aspects](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_within_aspects.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization within Aspects
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all aspects implemented with `Aspects` that handle or process external input** through intercepted method parameters or interactions with external systems.
    2.  **Implement robust input validation within these aspects implemented with `Aspects`** to ensure that input data conforms to expected formats, types, and ranges before being processed by the aspect or the intercepted method.
    3.  **Sanitize input data within aspects implemented with `Aspects`** to remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters or sequences before processing it within the aspect logic or passing it to the original intercepted method.
    4.  **Utilize established input validation and sanitization libraries within aspect implementations using `Aspects`** to avoid reinventing the wheel and ensure adherence to security best practices for input handling in aspect-oriented code.
    5.  **Log invalid input attempts detected within aspects implemented with `Aspects`** for security monitoring and potential incident detection related to malicious input targeting aspect-modified methods.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via Aspects (High Severity):** Prevents injection attacks (e.g., code injection, SQL injection, command injection) if aspects implemented with `Aspects` process untrusted input without proper validation and sanitization within their method interception logic.
    *   **Data Corruption via Malformed Input (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of aspects implemented with `Aspects` causing data corruption or application errors due to processing malformed or unexpected input within intercepted methods.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks and data corruption originating from or propagated through aspects implemented using the `Aspects` library.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Input validation might be present in general application code, but it might be overlooked or insufficiently implemented within aspect logic using `Aspects`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit input validation and sanitization routines within aspects implemented with `Aspects` that handle external input, dedicated testing for input validation in aspects using `Aspects`, centralized input validation libraries used consistently within aspects implemented with `Aspects`.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Develop unit tests specifically for each aspect implemented with `Aspects`** to verify its intended behavior in isolation, focusing on the aspect's logic and method interception functionality.
    2.  **Create integration tests to examine the interactions between aspects implemented with `Aspects` and the core application logic,** ensuring aspects do not introduce unintended side effects or disrupt normal application flow due to method modifications.
    3.  **Implement negative testing for aspects implemented with `Aspects`** to verify how they handle invalid inputs, error conditions, and unexpected scenarios during method interception and execution.
    4.  **Utilize code coverage tools to ensure that tests adequately cover aspect code implemented with `Aspects`** and their interactions with the application, particularly focusing on the code paths modified by aspects.
    5.  **Include security-focused test cases that specifically target potential security vulnerabilities introduced by aspects implemented with `Aspects`** (e.g., testing for bypasses of security checks due to aspect modifications of methods, unintended information leakage through aspect logging).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Side Effects Leading to Security Flaws (Medium Severity):** Identifies and prevents aspects implemented with `Aspects` from unintentionally introducing security vulnerabilities through unexpected interactions with other parts of the application due to method interception and modification.
    *   **Logic Errors in Aspects Causing Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Detects logic errors within aspect implementations using `Aspects` that could lead to exploitable vulnerabilities due to flaws in aspect logic or method modification.
*   **Impact:** Partially reduces the risk of unintended security flaws and logic errors introduced by aspects implemented with `Aspects`. Improves the overall reliability and security of aspect-enhanced application behavior.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General unit and integration testing might be in place, but dedicated testing specifically for aspects implemented with `Aspects`, especially security-focused testing, might be lacking.
