# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, SocketRocket, provides a WebSocket client library for iOS, macOS, and tvOS. It aims to simplify the integration of WebSocket communication into applications on Apple platforms.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enable real-time communication features in applications on Apple platforms.
- Provide a robust, performant, and reliable WebSocket client implementation.
- Offer an easy-to-use API for developers to integrate WebSocket functionality.
- Maintain compatibility with relevant WebSocket standards and protocols.
- Support a wide range of Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS).

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could compromise applications using it, leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
- Performance issues or instability in the library could negatively impact application performance and user experience.
- Lack of maintenance or updates could lead to compatibility issues with newer platforms or protocols, and unaddressed security vulnerabilities.
- Adoption risk if the library is not considered easy to use or reliable by developers.
- Dependency risk for applications relying on this library if it becomes unavailable or unmaintained.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process is likely in place as part of the open-source contribution model, although the extent and rigor are not explicitly documented. (Location: Github repository - pull request reviews)
- security control: Static analysis tools might be used as part of the development process, although not explicitly mentioned in the repository. (Assumption based on common software development practices)
- security control: Unit and integration tests are present, which can indirectly contribute to security by ensuring code correctness and preventing regressions. (Location: Github repository - test directory and CI configurations if available)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Limited formal security audits or penetration testing explicitly mentioned for this open-source project.
- accepted risk: No explicit security development lifecycle (SDL) documentation provided in the repository.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- security control: Introduce dependency scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by SocketRocket.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Consider performing periodic security audits or penetration testing by external security experts.
- security control: Document and follow a secure software development lifecycle (SDL) that includes security considerations at each stage of development.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: The library should support standard WebSocket authentication mechanisms, such as HTTP authentication during the handshake, and token-based authentication within the WebSocket protocol.
    - security requirement:  Ensure proper handling of credentials and secrets, avoiding hardcoding or insecure storage within the library itself.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: The library itself does not handle authorization, but it should provide mechanisms for applications to implement authorization logic based on the WebSocket connection and messages.
    - security requirement:  Applications using the library should be responsible for implementing appropriate authorization checks based on their specific requirements.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: The library must perform robust input validation on all data received from the WebSocket server to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    - security requirement:  Validate WebSocket frames, headers, and message payloads to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious content.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: The library must support secure WebSocket communication using TLS (wss:// protocol).
    - security requirement:  Ensure proper implementation of TLS, including certificate validation and secure cipher suite negotiation.
    - security requirement:  If the library implements any custom cryptographic operations, they must be implemented using secure and well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Enabling real-time features in applications (e.g., chat, live updates, real-time gaming).
- Reliable WebSocket communication for applications relying on SocketRocket.
- Secure communication channel for sensitive data transmitted over WebSockets.

Data Sensitivity:
- Data transmitted over WebSockets can vary in sensitivity depending on the application using SocketRocket.
- Could include:
    - Public data: Low sensitivity (e.g., public chat messages).
    - Private user data: Medium to High sensitivity (e.g., private messages, user activity data).
    - Sensitive application data: High sensitivity (e.g., financial transactions, health data).
- The sensitivity of data handled by SocketRocket is ultimately determined by the applications that use it. The library itself should be designed to securely handle any data passed through it, regardless of sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in SocketRocket? Is there a security policy or contact information available?
- Are there any regular security audits or penetration testing performed on SocketRocket?
- What static analysis and dependency scanning tools are currently used in the development and CI/CD pipeline (if any)?
- Is there a documented secure software development lifecycle (SDL) followed for SocketRocket?
- What are the performance requirements and constraints for SocketRocket? Are there specific performance testing or benchmarking processes in place?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a reliable and secure WebSocket client library for Apple platforms to enable real-time application features. Security and reliability are high priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: While some basic security practices are likely followed (code review, testing), there is room for improvement in formal security controls like SAST, dependency scanning, and documented SDL. The project relies heavily on community contributions for security.
- DESIGN: The design is relatively straightforward, focusing on providing a WebSocket client library that integrates into Apple applications. The deployment model is primarily native application deployment through the App Store or enterprise distribution. The build process is assumed to be automated using CI/CD principles, although the specifics need further investigation.
