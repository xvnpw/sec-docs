## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce WSS (WebSocket Secure)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_wss__websocket_secure_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce WSS (WebSocket Secure)

Here's a refined list of mitigation strategies that directly involve the SocketRocket library, focusing on its configuration and usage to enhance security.

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce WSS (WebSocket Secure)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review:**  Inspect all instances where `SRWebSocket` is initialized.
    2.  **URL Verification:** Ensure that the WebSocket URL passed to `SRWebSocket` constructor always starts with `wss://` instead of `ws://`.
    3.  **Configuration Enforcement:**  If using configuration files or environment variables for WebSocket URLs, strictly enforce that only `wss://` URLs are permitted for `SRWebSocket` initialization.
    4.  **Testing:**  Conduct integration tests to verify that `SRWebSocket` connections are established using WSS and that data is encrypted during transmission.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):**  Unencrypted `ws://` connections transmit data in plaintext, allowing attackers to intercept and read sensitive information communicated via `SRWebSocket`.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):**  Without encryption, attackers can intercept and modify communication between the client and server using `SRWebSocket`, potentially injecting malicious data or stealing credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:** High reduction - WSS encryption, enforced through `SRWebSocket`, makes eavesdropping extremely difficult.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High reduction - WSS, when used with `SRWebSocket`, provides authentication and encryption, significantly hindering man-in-the-middle attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in the application's network layer where `SRWebSocket` connections are established. URLs are configured to use `wss://` in production environments for `SRWebSocket`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No missing implementation currently for production `SRWebSocket` usage. However, ensure development and testing environments also default to `wss://` or have clear documentation to avoid accidental `ws://` usage in production with `SRWebSocket`.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Certificate Pinning](./mitigation_strategies/implement_certificate_pinning.md)

---

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Certificate Pinning

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Certificate/Public Key Extraction:** Obtain the server's TLS/SSL certificate or its public key used for WSS connections with `SRWebSocket`.
    2.  **Pinning Implementation within `SRWebSocketDelegate`:** Integrate certificate pinning within the application's network layer, specifically using the `SRWebSocketDelegate` methods. This involves:
        *   Bundling the server's certificate or public key within the application.
        *   Implementing custom certificate validation in `SRWebSocketDelegate` methods like `webSocket:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:`.
        *   Comparing the server's presented certificate against the pinned certificate or public key within the delegate.
        *   Rejecting the `SRWebSocket` connection in the delegate if the certificate does not match the pinned value.
    3.  **Pin Rotation Strategy:**  Establish a process for rotating pinned certificates or public keys used by `SRWebSocket` when server certificates are updated. This might involve application updates or remote configuration updates.
    4.  **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the pinning implementation for `SRWebSocket` by attempting connections with valid and invalid certificates (e.g., using a self-signed certificate or a certificate from a different domain) and verifying the delegate's behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks via Compromised CAs (High Severity):** If a Certificate Authority (CA) is compromised, attackers could issue fraudulent certificates for your domain. Certificate pinning within `SRWebSocketDelegate` prevents reliance solely on CAs and mitigates this risk for WebSocket connections.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks via Compromised CAs:** High reduction - Pinning within `SRWebSocketDelegate` ensures that even if a CA is compromised, `SRWebSocket` connections to your server are still protected as only the pinned certificate is trusted.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented for `SRWebSocket`. Standard system certificate validation is used for `SRWebSocket` connections.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Certificate pinning is missing in the network layer for `SRWebSocket` connections. Implementation is needed within the `SRWebSocketDelegate` methods, specifically `webSocket:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:`, to perform custom certificate validation.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Message Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_message_size_limits.md)

---

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Message Size Limits

*   **Description:**
    1.  **SocketRocket Configuration (if available):** Explore `SRWebSocket` configuration options to set a maximum allowed message size directly within the library's settings. If direct configuration is limited, consider implementing size checks within the `SRWebSocketDelegate`.
    2.  **Delegate-Based Size Checks:** If direct configuration is insufficient, implement message size checks within the `SRWebSocketDelegate` method `webSocket:didReceiveMessage:`.  Before processing the message, check its size against a defined limit.
    3.  **Define Reasonable Limits:** Determine appropriate message size limits for `SRWebSocket` based on the application's expected data volume and resource constraints. Consider both incoming and outgoing message sizes handled by `SRWebSocket`.
    4.  **Error Handling in Delegate:** Implement error handling in `SRWebSocketDelegate` methods to gracefully handle situations where messages exceed the configured size limit. Log errors and potentially close the `SRWebSocket` connection if necessary.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Messages (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers can send excessively large WebSocket messages through `SRWebSocket` to consume server and client resources (memory, bandwidth, processing power), potentially leading to denial of service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Messages:** Medium to High reduction - Limiting message sizes for `SRWebSocket` prevents attackers from easily overwhelming the application with oversized messages sent via WebSocket. The impact depends on how effectively the limits are enforced within `SRWebSocket` usage and the application's resource capacity.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No explicit message size limits are currently configured for `SRWebSocket` usage.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Message size limits need to be implemented for `SRWebSocket`. Explore direct configuration options first. If not sufficient, implement size checks within the `SRWebSocketDelegate` method `webSocket:didReceiveMessage:`.  Reasonable limits should be determined based on application requirements and resource constraints for `SRWebSocket` communication.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Unexpected/Malformed Messages Gracefully](./mitigation_strategies/handle_unexpectedmalformed_messages_gracefully.md)

---

### Mitigation Strategy: Handle Unexpected/Malformed Messages Gracefully

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Error Handling in `SRWebSocketDelegate` Methods:** Implement comprehensive error handling within `SRWebSocketDelegate` methods, particularly in `webSocket:didReceiveMessage:` which processes incoming messages from `SRWebSocket`.
    2.  **Exception Handling within Delegate:** Use try-catch blocks or similar mechanisms within `SRWebSocketDelegate` methods to handle potential exceptions during message processing (e.g., JSON parsing errors, data validation errors) of messages received via `SRWebSocket`.
    3.  **Logging within Delegate:** Log errors and details about unexpected or malformed messages received by `SRWebSocket` within the `SRWebSocketDelegate` methods for debugging and security monitoring purposes. Include relevant information like message content (if safe to log), error type, and timestamp.
    4.  **Graceful Degradation based on `SRWebSocket` state:** Design the application to gracefully handle situations where message processing from `SRWebSocket` fails. Avoid crashing or exposing sensitive information. Handle errors within the `SRWebSocketDelegate` and consider strategies like:
        *   Ignoring the malformed message from `SRWebSocket` and continuing operation.
        *   Requesting re-transmission of the message via `SRWebSocket` (if applicable protocol).
