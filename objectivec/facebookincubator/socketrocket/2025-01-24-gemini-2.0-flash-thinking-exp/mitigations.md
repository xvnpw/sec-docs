## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Message Size in SocketRocket](./mitigation_strategies/limit_message_size_in_socketrocket.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Limit Message Size in SocketRocket

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine appropriate maximum message sizes for both individual frames and complete messages based on your application's needs and resource constraints. Consider the expected data volume and network bandwidth.
    2.  Configure SocketRocket's `maxFrameSize` property during `SRWebSocket` initialization. This property limits the maximum size of individual WebSocket frames that SocketRocket will accept. Set this value to the determined maximum frame size in bytes.
    3.  Configure SocketRocket's `maxMessageSize` property during `SRWebSocket` initialization. This property limits the maximum size of a complete WebSocket message that SocketRocket will assemble and deliver to your application. Set this value to the determined maximum message size in bytes.
    4.  Ensure your application handles potential errors or connection closures that might occur if the server sends messages exceeding these configured limits. SocketRocket will likely close the connection if limits are violated.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Attackers can attempt to send excessively large messages to overwhelm server resources or client-side processing, leading to service disruption.
    *   **Buffer Overflow (Low Severity):** While less likely in modern languages, uncontrolled message sizes could theoretically contribute to buffer overflow vulnerabilities in underlying C/C++ components if not handled correctly by SocketRocket or the operating system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** High Reduction - Effectively prevents DoS attacks based on sending excessively large messages by limiting the resources consumed per message at the SocketRocket level.
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** Low Reduction - Provides a minor layer of defense against potential buffer overflows within SocketRocket's processing of frames and messages.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `maxFrameSize` is set to 65535 bytes in `WebSocketManager.swift` during `SRWebSocket` initialization.
    *   `maxMessageSize` is not explicitly set and defaults to a very large value (effectively unlimited).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `maxMessageSize` should be explicitly configured in `WebSocketManager.swift` to a reasonable limit based on application requirements when initializing `SRWebSocket`.
    *   Error handling within the application should be improved to gracefully manage connection closures initiated by SocketRocket due to message size violations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS/SSL for WebSocket Connections (WSS) with SocketRocket](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tlsssl_for_websocket_connections__wss__with_socketrocket.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce TLS/SSL for WebSocket Connections (WSS) with SocketRocket

*   **Description:**
    1.  Always use `wss://` URLs when creating `SRWebSocket` instances in your application code. This instructs SocketRocket to establish a secure WebSocket connection using TLS/SSL encryption.
    2.  Verify that your server-side WebSocket endpoint is configured to support WSS and has a valid TLS/SSL certificate installed. SocketRocket relies on the underlying operating system's TLS/SSL implementation to establish secure connections.
    3.  When initializing `SRWebSocket`, ensure you are not inadvertently disabling TLS/SSL verification. By default, SocketRocket will perform certificate verification. Avoid any custom configurations that might weaken TLS/SSL security unless absolutely necessary and with careful consideration.
    4.  While SocketRocket itself doesn't directly offer certificate pinning, you can explore implementing certificate pinning at a lower level (e.g., using NSURLSession's delegate methods if you are deeply customizing SocketRocket's networking layer, which is generally not recommended). If considering this, understand the complexities of certificate management and updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Without TLS/SSL, communication via SocketRocket is in plaintext, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on and potentially modify WebSocket messages.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Sensitive data transmitted over unencrypted WebSocket connections established by SocketRocket can be intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Attackers can intercept and modify unencrypted WebSocket messages transmitted via SocketRocket, potentially leading to data corruption, application malfunction, or security breaches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Reduction - TLS/SSL encryption enforced by using `wss://` with SocketRocket makes it extremely difficult for attackers to perform MitM attacks and eavesdrop or tamper with communication.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** High Reduction - Encrypts data in transit when using SocketRocket, rendering it unreadable to eavesdroppers.
    *   **Data Tampering:** High Reduction - Encryption and integrity checks within TLS/SSL protocols make it very difficult to tamper with messages transmitted via SocketRocket without detection.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The application currently uses `wss://` URLs for `SRWebSocket` connections in production environments.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit code checks to prevent accidental use of `ws://` URLs when creating `SRWebSocket` instances.
    *   Certificate pinning is not implemented in conjunction with SocketRocket.
    *   No automated checks or warnings to detect if a SocketRocket connection unexpectedly falls back to `ws://` due to configuration or network issues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep SocketRocket Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_socketrocket_updated.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Keep SocketRocket Updated

*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly check for updates to the SocketRocket library on its GitHub repository (https://github.com/facebookincubator/socketrocket) or through your dependency management tool (e.g., Swift Package Manager).
    2.  Monitor the SocketRocket repository's releases and commit history for any announcements of bug fixes or security patches. While dedicated security advisories might not be explicitly published, bug fixes often address potential vulnerabilities.
    3.  When updates are available, review the release notes and commit logs to understand the changes, paying particular attention to fixes related to networking, security, or stability.
    4.  Update SocketRocket to the latest version in your project using your dependency management tool (e.g., Swift Package Manager update command).
    5.  After updating SocketRocket, thoroughly test the WebSocket functionality in your application to ensure compatibility and that the update has not introduced any regressions or broken existing features.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in SocketRocket (High Severity):** Outdated versions of SocketRocket may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit if they are discovered and publicly disclosed.
    *   **Unpatched Bugs and Instabilities in SocketRocket (Variable Severity):**  Staying updated ensures you benefit from bug fixes and stability improvements, which can indirectly contribute to security by reducing unexpected behavior or crashes that could be exploited.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in SocketRocket:** High Reduction - Updating to the latest version patches known vulnerabilities within SocketRocket itself, significantly reducing the risk of direct exploitation of library flaws.
    *   **Unpatched Bugs and Instabilities in SocketRocket:** Medium Reduction - Improves overall stability and reduces the likelihood of unexpected behavior in SocketRocket that could potentially be leveraged for attacks or lead to security-relevant failures.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   SocketRocket version is managed using Swift Package Manager.
    *   Dependency updates are performed manually on a quarterly basis.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated checks for SocketRocket updates or monitoring of the SocketRocket repository for new releases or security-related fixes.
    *   The update process is manual and infrequent, potentially leaving the application vulnerable to known issues in older SocketRocket versions for extended periods.
    *   No formal process for reviewing SocketRocket release notes and commit logs specifically for security implications before updating.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews Focused on Secure SocketRocket Usage](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_focused_on_secure_socketrocket_usage.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Code Reviews Focused on Secure SocketRocket Usage

*   **Description:**
    1.  Incorporate code reviews as a mandatory step for all code changes that involve using SocketRocket or handling WebSocket communication within your application.
    2.  Specifically train code reviewers to focus on security aspects related to how SocketRocket is used, including:
        *   Verifying that `wss://` URLs are consistently used for `SRWebSocket` connections.
        *   Checking for correct configuration of `maxFrameSize` and `maxMessageSize` properties in `SRWebSocket` initialization.
        *   Reviewing how WebSocket messages are sent and received using SocketRocket's API, ensuring no misuse that could lead to vulnerabilities.
        *   Examining error handling related to SocketRocket operations (connection errors, message sending/receiving failures) to prevent information leaks or unexpected behavior.
        *   Ensuring no sensitive data is inadvertently exposed in logs or error messages related to SocketRocket.
    3.  Provide developers with secure coding guidelines specifically tailored to using SocketRocket, highlighting potential security pitfalls and best practices.
    4.  Utilize static analysis tools to automatically scan code for potential misconfigurations or insecure patterns in SocketRocket usage (though tool support for library-specific security checks might be limited).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Misuse of SocketRocket API (Variable Severity):** Developers might unintentionally misuse SocketRocket's API in ways that introduce security vulnerabilities, such as incorrect URL handling, improper error handling, or misconfiguration of security-related settings.
    *   **Configuration Errors Related to SocketRocket Security (Variable Severity):** Incorrectly configuring SocketRocket properties like message size limits or TLS/SSL usage can weaken security.
    *   **Lack of Awareness of Secure SocketRocket Usage Practices (Variable Severity):** Developers unfamiliar with best practices for secure WebSocket communication using SocketRocket might introduce vulnerabilities due to lack of knowledge.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Misuse of SocketRocket API:** Medium to High Reduction - Code reviews can catch many instances of incorrect or insecure SocketRocket API usage before they reach production.
    *   **Configuration Errors Related to SocketRocket Security:** Medium Reduction - Reviews can help identify misconfigurations of SocketRocket and ensure secure settings are applied.
    *   **Lack of Awareness of Secure SocketRocket Usage Practices:** Medium Reduction - Code reviews and developer training can improve awareness and promote secure coding practices specifically for SocketRocket.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Code reviews are mandatory for all code changes in the project.
    *   Security is considered as part of general code review guidelines.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Specific security checklists or guidelines for code reviews focusing on secure SocketRocket usage are not in place.
    *   No dedicated training for developers on secure WebSocket communication and best practices for using SocketRocket securely.
    *   Static analysis tools are not specifically configured to detect potential security issues related to SocketRocket API usage or configuration.
