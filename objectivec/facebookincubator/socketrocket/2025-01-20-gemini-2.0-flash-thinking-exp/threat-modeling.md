# Threat Model Analysis for facebookincubator/socketrocket

## Threat: [Insufficient TLS/SSL Configuration](./threats/insufficient_tlsssl_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack by exploiting the lack of strong TLS configuration in how SocketRocket establishes the connection. They could intercept the initial handshake and downgrade the connection to a less secure protocol or use weak ciphers, allowing them to eavesdrop on or modify the communication between the client and server.

**Impact:** Confidential data transmitted over the WebSocket connection could be exposed to the attacker, leading to data breaches or privacy violations.

**Affected Component:** Underlying TLS/SSL implementation used by `SRWebSocket` during connection establishment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce a minimum TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) when configuring the WebSocket connection using SocketRocket's options or through system-level settings.
*   Prefer strong and modern cipher suites, ensuring SocketRocket doesn't default to weaker options.
*   Disable support for older, insecure protocols and ciphers that might be negotiated by SocketRocket if not explicitly configured.

## Threat: [Certificate Pinning Bypass](./threats/certificate_pinning_bypass.md)

**Description:** If the application implements certificate pinning, vulnerabilities in `SRWebSocket`'s handling of certificate validation could allow an attacker to bypass the pinning mechanism. This could allow them to present a fraudulent certificate and successfully establish a connection, impersonating the legitimate server.

**Impact:** Allows man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to data theft, manipulation of communication, or injection of malicious content.

**Affected Component:** `SRWebSocket`'s certificate validation logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement certificate pinning correctly and securely, utilizing SocketRocket's provided mechanisms or integrating with secure pinning libraries.
*   Regularly review and update the pinning implementation to adapt to certificate rotations or changes.
*   Ensure SocketRocket's certificate validation mechanisms are not bypassed by application-level code.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) during Handshake (even with TLS)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__during_handshake__even_with_tls_.md)

**Description:** Even with TLS enabled, subtle vulnerabilities in `SRWebSocket`'s handshake process could be exploited. An attacker could intercept or manipulate HTTP headers during the upgrade request, potentially leading to a compromised connection.

**Impact:** Could lead to a compromised WebSocket connection, allowing for eavesdropping or data manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `SRWebSocket`'s connection establishment and handshake logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review the application's WebSocket connection setup and ensure no sensitive information is exposed during the handshake managed by SocketRocket.
*   Keep SocketRocket updated to benefit from any security fixes related to handshake handling.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption in Message Handling](./threats/buffer_overflowmemory_corruption_in_message_handling.md)

**Description:** A malicious server could send specially crafted, excessively large messages that exploit vulnerabilities in `SRWebSocket`'s message parsing or handling logic. This could lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues on the client side.

**Impact:** Could lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially even remote code execution on the client device.

**Affected Component:** `SRWebSocket`'s message receiving and processing logic, potentially within functions handling data framing and parsing.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep SocketRocket updated to benefit from bug fixes related to memory safety.
*   While relying on SocketRocket's internal handling, be aware of potential vulnerabilities and consider additional application-level checks if extremely sensitive data is involved.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Malformed Messages](./threats/denial_of_service_through_malformed_messages.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a large number of malformed or excessively large messages that cause `SRWebSocket` to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) or crash the application.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** `SRWebSocket`'s message receiving and processing logic, error handling mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on the server-side to prevent excessive message sending.
*   Ensure SocketRocket's error handling is robust and prevents crashes due to malformed input. Keep SocketRocket updated for potential fixes in this area.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Connection Handling](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_connection_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to exhaust the application's resources by rapidly opening and closing WebSocket connections, potentially exploiting inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in `SRWebSocket`'s connection management.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive resource consumption.

**Affected Component:** `SRWebSocket`'s connection management logic, potentially the functions responsible for establishing and closing connections.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement connection limits on the server-side.
*   Ensure the application properly handles connection failures and avoids repeatedly attempting to connect in a tight loop, potentially exacerbating issues within SocketRocket's connection handling.
*   Keep SocketRocket updated for potential fixes related to resource management in connection handling.
