# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookincubator/socketrocket

## Attack Surface: [Malformed WebSocket Frame Handling](./attack_surfaces/malformed_websocket_frame_handling.md)

*   **Description:** The application receives a WebSocket frame from the server that violates the WebSocket protocol specification.
    *   **How SocketRocket Contributes:** Flaws in `socketrocket`'s parsing logic for incoming frames can lead to crashes, unexpected states, or undefined behavior when encountering malformed data.
    *   **Example:** A malicious server sends a frame with an invalid opcode or a frame with the masking bit set incorrectly for a client-to-server message.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `socketrocket` updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement robust error handling around message reception to gracefully handle unexpected data.
        *   Consider additional validation on top of `socketrocket`'s parsing for critical applications.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Message Flooding](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_message_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious server sends a large number of messages or excessively large messages to the client, overwhelming its resources.
    *   **How SocketRocket Contributes:**  Insufficient buffering or memory management within `socketrocket` for incoming messages can make it vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Example:** A malicious server continuously sends large binary messages, consuming client memory and potentially leading to crashes.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, crashes due to memory exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `socketrocket` or implement application-level checks to limit the maximum size of incoming messages.
        *   Implement logic to limit the rate at which the application processes incoming messages.
        *   Monitor the application's resource usage when using `socketrocket`.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The default SSL/TLS configuration used by `socketrocket` might have weaknesses or be overly permissive, making connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How SocketRocket Contributes:** If `socketrocket` defaults to allowing weak ciphers, doesn't enforce certificate validation, or allows self-signed certificates without explicit configuration, it increases the risk of insecure connections.
    *   **Example:** `socketrocket` might, by default, accept connections using older SSL protocols with known vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to eavesdrop or manipulate the communication.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data manipulation, man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure `socketrocket` to use strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and disable weak ciphers.
        *   Ensure that `socketrocket` is configured to properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate and does not allow self-signed certificates in production.
        *   Consider implementing certificate pinning for enhanced security.
