# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookincubator/socketrocket

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Negotiation](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_negotiation.md)

* **Description:** The WebSocket connection might be established using outdated or weak TLS/SSL protocols or cipher suites, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **How SocketRocket Contributes:** SocketRocket relies on the underlying operating system's or a linked networking library's TLS/SSL implementation. If not explicitly configured by the application, it might default to less secure options or allow negotiation of weak cipher suites supported by the server.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts the initial handshake and forces the connection to use SSLv3, which has known vulnerabilities like POODLE.
    * **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted over the WebSocket connection can be intercepted and decrypted by an attacker.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Explicitly configure the minimum acceptable TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) within the application's SocketRocket configuration or through underlying networking libraries.
            * Ensure that only strong and secure cipher suites are allowed during the TLS handshake. This might involve configuring the underlying networking library or OS settings.
            * Regularly update the operating system and any linked networking libraries to benefit from security patches related to TLS/SSL.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Frame Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/websocket_frame_injectionmanipulation.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how SocketRocket parses and handles incoming WebSocket frames could allow an attacker to inject malicious frames or manipulate existing ones.
    * **How SocketRocket Contributes:** Bugs or oversights in SocketRocket's frame parsing logic could lead to unexpected behavior when processing specially crafted frames. This could bypass security checks or trigger unintended actions within the application's WebSocket message handling logic.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a malformed control frame that causes SocketRocket to enter an unexpected state, leading to a crash or allowing subsequent malicious frames to be processed without proper validation by the application.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, unexpected application behavior, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities depending on how the application processes WebSocket data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Ensure the application's WebSocket message handling logic is robust and validates all incoming data, regardless of its source.
            * Keep SocketRocket updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches related to frame parsing.
            * Implement rate limiting or other mechanisms to mitigate the impact of a flood of malicious frames.
