"""
# Hypothetical example of disabling certificate validation (HIGHLY DISCOURAGED):
socket = WebSocket()
socket.disable_certificate_validation = True  # This would be a major security flaw

# Example of potentially outdated TLS configuration (illustrative):
socket.tls_version = "TLSv1.0" # Using older, potentially vulnerable TLS versions

# Example of secure practice:
"""
# Implementing certificate pinning (conceptual):
expected_certificate_hash = "..." # Hash of the expected server certificate

# - Analyzing how the application using SocketRocket configures TLS settings.
