## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Connection Establishment Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_connection_establishment_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on weaknesses in the initial connection setup, which can bypass security measures and grant attackers unauthorized access.

* **Critical Node: TLS/SSL Vulnerabilities (within SocketRocket's TLS implementation) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** This node represents a significant risk due to the potential for compromising the confidentiality and integrity of communication.
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit known TLS vulnerabilities (e.g., Heartbleed, POODLE, etc.) if SocketRocket uses an outdated or vulnerable TLS library. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Description:** Attackers can exploit known flaws in outdated TLS libraries used by SocketRocket to decrypt communication, steal sensitive data, or even execute arbitrary code.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on dependency management).
        * **Impact:** Critical (data breach, MITM).
        * **Effort:** Low (if exploits are available) to High (if custom exploit needed).
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (requires deep packet inspection).
    * **Attack Vector: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack due to improper certificate validation [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Description:** If the application using SocketRocket doesn't properly verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate, attackers can intercept and manipulate communication between the client and server.
        * **Likelihood:** Low (if application implements validation) to Medium (if not).
        * **Impact:** Critical (data breach, manipulation).
        * **Effort:** Medium.
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (requires network monitoring and inspection).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path targets weaknesses in how SocketRocket processes incoming data, potentially leading to code execution or data manipulation.

* **Critical Node: Maliciously Crafted WebSocket Messages [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** This node highlights the dangers of processing untrusted data received over the WebSocket connection.
    * **Attack Vector: Send oversized messages leading to buffer overflows [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Description:** Attackers send messages exceeding the buffer capacity of SocketRocket or the application, potentially overwriting memory and leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on SocketRocket's implementation).
        * **Impact:** Critical (code execution, DoS).
        * **Effort:** Medium.
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (requires analysis of message size and potential crashes).
    * **Attack Vector: Inject malicious code or commands within messages [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Description:** Attackers embed malicious payloads within WebSocket messages that, if not properly sanitized by the application, can be executed by the server or client.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium to High (application-dependent).
        * **Impact:** Critical (code execution, data manipulation).
        * **Effort:** Low to Medium.
        * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (requires content analysis).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Management Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_management_issues__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on overwhelming the application with excessive resource consumption, leading to denial of service.

* **Attack Vector: Open a large number of connections rapidly [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Description:** Attackers establish a large number of WebSocket connections in a short period, exhausting server resources and preventing legitimate users from connecting.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium.
    * **Impact:** Moderate to Significant (DoS).
    * **Effort:** Low.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (high number of connections from a single source).
* **Attack Vector: Send a continuous stream of large messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Description:** Attackers flood the server with large messages, consuming excessive memory and potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on implementation).
    * **Impact:** Moderate to Significant (DoS).
    * **Effort:** Low.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (requires monitoring memory usage).
* **Attack Vector: Rapidly open and close connections without proper cleanup [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Description:** Attackers repeatedly open and close WebSocket connections without allowing the server to properly release resources, eventually leading to file descriptor exhaustion and preventing new connections.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on implementation).
    * **Impact:** Significant (DoS).
    * **Effort:** Low.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate (requires monitoring system resources).
