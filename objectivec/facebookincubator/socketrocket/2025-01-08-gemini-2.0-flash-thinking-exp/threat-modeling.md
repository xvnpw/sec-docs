# Threat Model Analysis for facebookincubator/socketrocket

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack during WebSocket Handshake](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_websocket_handshake.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the initial WebSocket handshake between the client application (using `socketrocket`) and the server. The attacker might downgrade the connection to an unencrypted `ws://` protocol or present a fraudulent certificate to establish a secure connection with the attacker instead of the legitimate server. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on or modify subsequent communication.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted over the WebSocket connection can be exposed to the attacker. The attacker can also manipulate data being sent or received, potentially leading to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or impersonation.
*   **Affected Component:** `SRWebSocket`'s connection establishment process, specifically the TLS/SSL handshake.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce WSS:** Always use `wss://` for WebSocket connections to ensure encryption.
    *   **Implement Certificate Pinning:**  Configure `socketrocket` to only accept specific, known certificates from the server. This prevents the acceptance of fraudulent certificates.
    *   **Proper Certificate Validation:** Ensure the application correctly validates the server's certificate using the operating system's trust store or a custom validation mechanism.
    *   **Avoid Ignoring Certificate Errors:**  Do not configure `socketrocket` to ignore certificate validation errors in production environments.

## Threat: [Data Injection via Malicious WebSocket Messages](./threats/data_injection_via_malicious_websocket_messages.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having potentially compromised the connection or acting as a malicious client, sends crafted WebSocket messages containing malicious data or commands. If the application using `socketrocket` doesn't properly sanitize or validate incoming messages, this malicious data can be interpreted as legitimate commands, leading to unintended actions or security breaches on the server or other connected clients.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the application's logic, this could lead to unauthorized data modification, execution of arbitrary code on the server (if the server-side WebSocket implementation is vulnerable), or manipulation of other connected clients.
*   **Affected Component:** `SRWebSocket`'s message receiving and processing logic (`- (void)handleMessage:(id)msg;`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received through the WebSocket connection before processing it.
    *   **Use a Well-Defined Message Format:** Employ a structured message format (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers) and validate messages against the expected schema.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying TLS/SSL Libraries](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_tlsssl_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** `socketrocket` relies on the underlying operating system's TLS/SSL libraries for secure communication. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to exploit them during the WebSocket handshake or data transmission, even if the application itself is correctly using `socketrocket`.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of the secure communication channel, potentially leading to eavesdropping, data manipulation, or MITM attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** The usage of the operating system's TLS/SSL implementation by `socketrocket`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Operating System Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the operating system and its security patches to ensure that the latest versions of TLS/SSL libraries are used, addressing known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Stay Informed about Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories related to the operating system and TLS/SSL libraries used by the application's target platforms.
