# Attack Surface Analysis for react-native-maps/react-native-maps

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Native Map SDKs](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_native_map_sdks.md)

*   **Description:** `react-native-maps` relies on native map SDKs (Google Maps SDK for Android, Apple Maps for iOS). Security flaws within these underlying SDKs can be indirectly exploitable through `react-native-maps`.
    *   **How react-native-maps Contributes:** By integrating and utilizing these native SDKs, `react-native-maps` inherently exposes the application to any security vulnerabilities present within them. The library acts as a bridge, and flaws in the foundation can impact the applications built upon it.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability in the Google Maps SDK could potentially allow a malicious actor to trigger arbitrary code execution within the application context or gain unauthorized access to device resources through the map component.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential for arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or device compromise depending on the severity of the underlying SDK vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability in the underlying SDK)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Diligently update `react-native-maps` to the latest version. This often includes updates to the underlying native map SDKs or incorporates fixes for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and release notes for both `react-native-maps` and the native map SDKs (Google Maps Platform SDK, Apple Maps). Promptly address any identified vulnerabilities by updating dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Map Interactions (when directly facilitated by `react-native-maps` features)](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_map_interactions__when_directly_facilitated_by__react-native-maps__featur_3e4fe70d.md)

*   **Description:**  The way the application uses `react-native-maps` features to display or interact with map data could inadvertently reveal sensitive information due to the library's capabilities.
    *   **How react-native-maps Contributes:**  `react-native-maps` provides the components and functionalities to display markers, polygons, and other map elements. If the application uses these features to display sensitive data without proper access controls or safeguards, the library facilitates this potential disclosure.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `react-native-maps` to display the real-time locations of delivery drivers on a public-facing map without proper authentication, inadvertently exposing their current positions to anyone.
    *   **Impact:** Privacy violation, potential for stalking or other malicious activities targeting the individuals whose information is disclosed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Access Controls:** Ensure that access to sensitive map data displayed through `react-native-maps` is restricted to authorized users through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   **Data Obfuscation/Aggregation:** When displaying potentially sensitive information on the map, consider using techniques like data aggregation or obfuscation to reduce the risk of individual identification. For example, instead of showing exact locations, display heatmaps or cluster markers.
        *   **Careful Feature Implementation:**  Thoroughly review how `react-native-maps` features are used to display data and ensure that the implementation does not inadvertently expose sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
