# Threat Model Analysis for react-native-maps/react-native-maps

## Threat: [Malicious Native Code Execution](./threats/malicious_native_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability *within the `react-native-maps` native module itself* (or its direct dependencies) to inject and execute arbitrary native code on the user's device. This could be achieved by sending crafted data through the JavaScript bridge that exploits a flaw in the module's code or by triggering memory corruption within the module.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's device, including data theft, installation of malware, unauthorized access to resources, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `react-native-maps` native module (specifically the bridge between JavaScript and native code, and the core native implementation).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `react-native-maps` updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities within the library's code.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on any data passed from JavaScript to the `react-native-maps` native module.
*   Regularly review the `react-native-maps` library's changelog and security advisories for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Native APIs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_native_apis.md)

**Description:** The `react-native-maps` library might contain vulnerabilities that inadvertently expose sensitive native device APIs through its JavaScript interface. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities to directly call these sensitive APIs without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to device sensors (camera, microphone, location), file system access, or other sensitive functionalities *due to flaws in `react-native-maps`'s API exposure*, potentially leading to data theft, privacy violations, or device manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `react-native-maps` native module (specifically the JavaScript bridge and the native methods exposed by the library).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review the `react-native-maps` source code to understand which native APIs are being exposed and how they are being used by the library.
*   Minimize the surface area of exposed native functionality within the `react-native-maps` library if possible (this would require contributing to the library).
*   Report any discovered unintended or insecure native API exposures to the `react-native-maps` maintainers.

## Threat: [Location Data Leakage (via `react-native-maps` vulnerabilities)](./threats/location_data_leakage__via__react-native-maps__vulnerabilities_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities *within the `react-native-maps` library's location handling logic* to gain unauthorized access to the user's current or past locations. This could involve flaws in how the library interacts with the native location services or insecure handling of location data within the module.

**Impact:** Privacy violation, potential stalking or physical harm, exposure of sensitive routines and habits due to vulnerabilities in `react-native-maps`.

**Affected Component:** Location tracking functionalities within the `react-native-maps` native module and the JavaScript API provided by the library for accessing location data (e.g., how `react-native-maps` implements and uses `getCurrentPosition`, `watchPosition`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `react-native-maps` updated to patch any identified vulnerabilities in its location handling.
*   Be aware of the permissions requested by `react-native-maps` and ensure they are appropriate for your application's use case.
*   Report any suspicious or insecure location data handling within the library to its maintainers.

## Threat: [Exposure of Mapping Provider API Keys (due to `react-native-maps` flaws)](./threats/exposure_of_mapping_provider_api_keys__due_to__react-native-maps__flaws_.md)

**Description:** If the `react-native-maps` library itself has vulnerabilities in how it handles or stores API keys for the underlying mapping providers (like Google Maps Platform), an attacker could potentially extract these keys by exploiting these flaws. This could involve vulnerabilities in the library's configuration loading or storage mechanisms.

**Impact:** Unauthorized usage of the mapping services under the application's credentials, potentially leading to financial costs for the application owner or enabling malicious activities using the compromised API key *due to flaws in `react-native-maps`*.

**Affected Component:** Configuration handling within the `react-native-maps` native module and potentially the JavaScript API if keys are passed or managed through it by the library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid passing API keys directly through `react-native-maps` if possible. Configure the underlying native SDKs directly if the library allows it.
*   Report any insecure API key handling practices within `react-native-maps` to its maintainers.
*   Monitor network traffic to detect any unusual API key usage originating from the application.
