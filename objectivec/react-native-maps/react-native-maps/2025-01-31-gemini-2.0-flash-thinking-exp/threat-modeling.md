# Threat Model Analysis for react-native-maps/react-native-maps

## Threat: [Location Data Exposure via Insecure Usage in Application Code](./threats/location_data_exposure_via_insecure_usage_in_application_code.md)

**Description:** Developers using `react-native-maps` might unintentionally expose sensitive user location data by logging it, storing it insecurely, or transmitting it without proper encryption within their application code. For example, logging latitude and longitude values directly to console or unencrypted files during development or even in production builds. An attacker gaining access to these logs or insecure storage could retrieve user location history.
**Impact:** Privacy breach, unauthorized tracking of users, potential identity theft, reputational damage, legal and regulatory penalties.
**Affected Component:** Application code utilizing `react-native-maps` location features (e.g., `MapView`'s `onUserLocationChange` event, Geolocation API usage in conjunction with maps).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly avoid logging or storing raw location data unless absolutely necessary and with strong justification.
*   If location data logging is required for debugging, ensure it is disabled in production builds and use secure logging mechanisms in development environments.
*   Implement secure storage practices for location data if persistence is needed, utilizing device encryption or secure storage APIs.
*   Always transmit location data over HTTPS and ensure any backend services handling location data also enforce strong security measures.
*   Regularly review application code for accidental or insecure handling of location data related to `react-native-maps` usage.

## Threat: [API Key Theft and Abuse due to Insecure Storage](./threats/api_key_theft_and_abuse_due_to_insecure_storage.md)

**Description:**  `react-native-maps` often requires API keys from map providers (like Google Maps or Mapbox). If these API keys are embedded directly in the application code, configuration files within the app bundle, or are otherwise easily retrievable from the client-side application, attackers can extract them. Attackers can then use these stolen API keys to make unauthorized requests to the map service, potentially incurring significant costs for the application owner, exceeding usage quotas, or causing denial of service.
**Impact:** Financial losses due to unauthorized API usage, service disruption, potential legal liabilities from exceeding API terms of service, reputational damage.
**Affected Component:** Application configuration related to `react-native-maps` API key setup, potentially affecting all components relying on the map service (e.g., `MapView`, map tiles, geocoding).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never hardcode API keys directly into the application code or easily accessible configuration files within the app bundle.**
*   Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management systems to store API keys outside of the application bundle.
*   Implement API key restrictions provided by the map service provider, such as platform restrictions (Android/iOS), and referrer restrictions if applicable.
*   Consider using backend proxies to manage API key usage, where the mobile application requests map data through your server, and your server handles the API key and requests to the map provider.
*   Regularly monitor API key usage for anomalies and implement alerts for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Critical Vulnerabilities in `react-native-maps` Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_critical_vulnerabilities_in__react-native-maps__dependencies.md)

**Description:** `react-native-maps` relies on a complex ecosystem of third-party libraries and native modules for its functionality on both iOS and Android. If critical security vulnerabilities are discovered in any of these dependencies (either JavaScript or native), and these vulnerabilities are exploitable through the `react-native-maps` interface or usage patterns, attackers could leverage them to compromise the application or user devices. This could range from application crashes and denial of service to remote code execution or data breaches, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
**Impact:** Application instability, crashes, denial of service, remote code execution on user devices, data breaches, complete compromise of user devices in severe cases.
**Affected Component:** `react-native-maps` module itself and its transitive dependencies, both JavaScript and native modules used for map rendering and functionality.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Maintain `react-native-maps` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.** Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for `react-native-maps` and its dependencies.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools in your development pipeline to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   Implement a robust software composition analysis (SCA) process to track and manage dependencies and their security risks.
*   In case of a discovered critical vulnerability, follow the recommended remediation steps provided by the `react-native-maps` maintainers or the affected dependency maintainers immediately.
