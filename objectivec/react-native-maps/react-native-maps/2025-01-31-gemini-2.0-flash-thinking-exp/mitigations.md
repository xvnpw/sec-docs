# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for react-native-maps/react-native-maps

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Key Restriction (React Native Maps Context)](./mitigation_strategies/api_key_restriction__react_native_maps_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** API Key Restriction for Map Services
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Access Map Provider Console:** Navigate to the API key management console for your chosen map provider (e.g., Google Cloud Console for Google Maps Platform, Apple Developer for Apple Maps).
    2.  **Locate API Key Settings:** Find the settings for the API key used within your `react-native-maps` application.
    3.  **Restrict by Application Identifiers:** Configure the API key to be restricted to only function with your application's specific bundle identifier (iOS) and package name (Android). This ensures only your compiled application can use the key.
    4.  **Platform-Specific Keys (Recommended):**  Create separate API keys for Android and iOS platforms and restrict each key to its respective platform's application identifier for finer control.
    5.  **Service Restrictions:** Limit the API key's usage to only the necessary map-related services (e.g., Maps SDK for Android, Maps JavaScript API if used for web components, Geocoding API if used).
    6.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and update these restrictions as your application evolves or if you suspect unauthorized usage.
*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Unauthorized Map Service Usage via Leaked API Key (High Severity):** Prevents malicious actors from exploiting a leaked API key within `react-native-maps` to access map services under your account, leading to unexpected billing and service disruption.
    *   **API Quota Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of your API quota being exhausted by unauthorized usage stemming from a compromised API key used in `react-native-maps`.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Unauthorized Map Service Usage:** High impact reduction. Effectively limits API key usage to your intended application, minimizing financial and service abuse.
    *   **API Quota Exhaustion:** Medium impact reduction. Protects against unexpected quota overages due to external misuse of your map service API key.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. API keys for Android are restricted by application identifiers in the Google Cloud Console.
*   **Missing Implementation:** API key restrictions for iOS need to be configured in the Apple Developer portal. Platform-specific API keys are used for Google Maps but need to be implemented for Apple Maps as well. Service restrictions for Apple Maps API key need to be reviewed and configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Key Obfuscation (React Native Maps Context)](./mitigation_strategies/api_key_obfuscation__react_native_maps_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** API Key Obfuscation within React Native Maps Application
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Remove Hardcoded Keys:** Eliminate any instances where the map service API key is directly embedded as a string in your JavaScript code or configuration files used by `react-native-maps`.
    2.  **Environment Variables via `react-native-config`:** Utilize `react-native-config` or similar libraries to store the API key as an environment variable. Access this variable within your React Native code when initializing `react-native-maps`. This prevents the key from being directly visible in the codebase.
    3.  **Native Module Storage (Enhanced Security):** For stronger obfuscation, create a native module (Swift/Objective-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android). Store the API key securely within the native module (using platform-specific secure storage if needed). Expose a function from the native module to your JavaScript code to retrieve the API key for use with `react-native-maps`.
    4.  **Build-Time Secrets Injection (Advanced):** Integrate with a secrets management system in your build pipeline to inject the API key at build time, further separating it from the codebase.
*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Accidental API Key Exposure in Code (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally committing the API key to version control systems or exposing it in easily decompiled application bundles, which could be exploited to misuse map services.
    *   **Reverse Engineering of React Native Maps Application (Medium Severity):** Makes it more challenging for attackers to extract the API key by reverse-engineering the compiled React Native application, as the key is not directly present in the JavaScript code.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Accidental API Key Exposure:** Medium impact reduction. Significantly lowers the chance of unintentional key leaks through code repositories.
    *   **Reverse Engineering:** Medium impact reduction. Increases the effort required to extract the key, though determined attackers might still find ways.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. API keys are stored as environment variables using `react-native-config` in the current project.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Native module implementation for API key retrieval is not yet implemented. Build-time secrets injection is not currently in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Location Permission Runtime Request (React Native Maps Features)](./mitigation_strategies/location_permission_runtime_request__react_native_maps_features_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Runtime Location Permission Requests for `react-native-maps` Features
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Identify Location-Dependent Features:** Determine which features in your application that utilize `react-native-maps` require access to the user's location (e.g., showing user's current location on the map, location-based search, proximity alerts).
    2.  **Remove Manifest/Info.plist Declarations:** Ensure location permissions are *not* declared in `AndroidManifest.xml` (Android) or `Info.plist` (iOS). This forces runtime permission requests.
    3.  **Request Permission Before Map Feature Usage:**  Use `react-native-permissions` or platform APIs to request location permissions *only when* a location-dependent `react-native-maps` feature is about to be used.
    4.  **Provide Clear Rationale:** Before requesting permission, display a user-friendly explanation of *why* the specific `react-native-maps` feature needs location access and how it enhances their experience.
    5.  **Handle Permission Outcomes**:
        *   **Permission Granted:** Enable the location-dependent `react-native-maps` feature.
        *   **Permission Denied:** Gracefully disable or degrade the feature. Explain to the user that the feature is limited without location access. Avoid repeatedly prompting if permission is persistently denied.
    6.  **Respect Permission Revocation:**  Monitor for location permission revocation (users can change permissions in device settings). If revoked, disable or adjust the behavior of location-dependent `react-native-maps` features accordingly.
*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **User Privacy Concerns Related to Map Location Features (Medium Severity):** Addresses user privacy concerns by providing transparency and control over location access for `react-native-maps` functionalities, increasing user trust.
    *   **Unnecessary Location Access (Low Severity):** Ensures location access is only requested and used when genuinely required for specific `react-native-maps` features, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **User Privacy Concerns:** Medium impact reduction. Improves user perception of privacy and control over their location data within the map application.
    *   **Unnecessary Location Access:** Low impact reduction. Promotes better privacy practices and resource management.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. Runtime location permissions are requested using `react-native-permissions` before enabling location-based features within `react-native-maps`. Rationale messages are displayed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Handling of permission revocation within the application could be refined to provide more proactive feedback to the user when map features become limited due to permission changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Map Related User Input (React Native Maps Context)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_map_related_user_input__react_native_maps_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation for User-Provided Map Data in React Native Maps Interactions
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Identify Map Input Fields:** Locate all user input fields within your application that are directly related to `react-native-maps` interactions (e.g., address search bars used for map navigation, fields for adding custom marker titles/descriptions, coordinate input for map centering).
    2.  **Define Map Data Validation Rules:** Establish validation rules specific to map data types:
        *   **Address Fields:** Validate against expected address formats, limit character length, potentially use geocoding API with input validation to verify valid addresses.
        *   **Coordinate Fields:** Validate latitude and longitude ranges, ensure numeric input, check for valid coordinate formats.
        *   **Marker Descriptions/Titles:** Sanitize input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, limit character length, restrict allowed characters if necessary.
    3.  **Client-Side Validation in React Native:** Implement client-side validation in your React Native components to provide immediate feedback to users when entering map-related data, improving user experience and catching basic errors early.
    4.  **Server-Side Validation (If Applicable):** If user-provided map data is sent to your backend server for processing (e.g., geocoding requests, saving custom map data), implement robust server-side validation as the primary security measure.
    5.  **Sanitize Map Input:** Sanitize all user-provided map data to remove or encode potentially harmful characters or code before using it in map queries, displaying it on the map (e.g., in marker callouts), or storing it.
*   **Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Map Data Input (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts through user input fields related to `react-native-maps` (e.g., in marker descriptions) that could be executed when the map is rendered or interacted with.
    *   **Map Data Integrity Issues (Low Severity):** Ensures the quality and consistency of user-provided map data, preventing unexpected behavior or errors in `react-native-maps` functionalities due to malformed input.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Medium impact reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from user input within map-related features.
    *   **Map Data Integrity:** Low impact reduction. Improves the reliability and predictability of map-related features by ensuring data validity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Client-side validation exists for some map input fields (e.g., character limits). Basic sanitization is applied in certain areas.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Server-side validation for map data is not yet implemented. More comprehensive client-side and server-side validation and sanitization rules are needed for all user input fields interacting with `react-native-maps`. Geocoding API integration with input validation for address fields is not implemented.
