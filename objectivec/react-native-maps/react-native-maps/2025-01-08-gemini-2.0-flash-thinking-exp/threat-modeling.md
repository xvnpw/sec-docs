# Threat Model Analysis for react-native-maps/react-native-maps

## Threat: [Exposure of API Keys/Tokens](./threats/exposure_of_api_keystokens.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers API keys or tokens required to access map services (e.g., Google Maps Platform API key) embedded within the application code, configuration files directly related to `react-native-maps` setup, or during network communication initiated by the library.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized usage of the API key, leading to unexpected charges, quota exhaustion, denial of service for legitimate users of the application's map features, or potential abuse of the map service by the attacker.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration settings used by the `MapView` component, specifically how API keys are provided to the underlying native map SDKs through `react-native-maps`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid embedding API keys directly in the application code or in easily accessible configuration files.
    *   Utilize environment variables or secure key management systems to store and access API keys.
    *   Implement API key restrictions based on application identifiers (e.g., bundle ID, package name) and IP address restrictions where possible within the map service provider's console.
    *   Regularly rotate API keys as a security best practice.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Native Map SDKs](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_native_map_sdks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages known vulnerabilities in the underlying native map SDKs (e.g., Google Maps SDK for Android, MapKit for iOS) that `react-native-maps` directly interfaces with. This might involve crafting specific map interactions or exploiting bugs in how the SDK handles data passed to it by `react-native-maps`.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, arbitrary code execution on the user's device, information disclosure by bypassing security measures within the native SDK, or other malicious actions depending on the nature of the underlying SDK vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** The bridge layer within `react-native-maps` that facilitates communication and data exchange between the JavaScript code and the native map SDKs, potentially affecting core components like `MapView`, markers, polygons, and other map elements.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability and its potential impact).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `react-native-maps` updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes and wrappers to mitigate known vulnerabilities in the underlying SDKs.
    *   Ensure the native map SDKs are also updated to their latest stable versions within the application's native dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories and release notes for the relevant native map SDKs and `react-native-maps` for any reported vulnerabilities and apply necessary updates promptly.

## Threat: [Use of Outdated `react-native-maps` Version with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/use_of_outdated__react-native-maps__version_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses an older version of the `react-native-maps` library that contains known security vulnerabilities that have been identified and patched in later versions of the library.
*   **Impact:** Potential exploitation of known vulnerabilities within `react-native-maps` itself, leading to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially creating avenues for attackers to interact with the native map SDKs in unintended and harmful ways.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire `react-native-maps` library and its various modules and components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the known vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain `react-native-maps` updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Regularly review release notes and security advisories for `react-native-maps` to be aware of any disclosed vulnerabilities and the corresponding updates.
    *   Implement a robust dependency management strategy to ensure timely updates of all project dependencies, including `react-native-maps`.
