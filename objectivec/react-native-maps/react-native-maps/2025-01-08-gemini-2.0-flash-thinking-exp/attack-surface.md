# Attack Surface Analysis for react-native-maps/react-native-maps

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Handling in Native Module Interface](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_handling_in_native_module_interface.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of data passed between the JavaScript and native code layers of `react-native-maps`. This can include insufficient validation, lack of sanitization, or insecure serialization/deserialization.

**How `react-native-maps` Contributes:**  The library relies on the React Native bridge to communicate with native map components. It passes data related to map elements (markers, polygons, etc.), user interactions, and configuration options through this bridge.

**Example:** A malicious application could send crafted data for marker coordinates or polygon definitions that cause a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues in the native map module.

**Impact:** Application crashes, potential for remote code execution in the native context, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received from the JavaScript layer in the native module.
    *   Use secure serialization/deserialization techniques.
    *   Employ memory-safe programming practices in the native module.
    *   Regularly update `react-native-maps` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through User-Provided Map Data](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_user-provided_map_data.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to input data that is displayed on the map (e.g., marker descriptions, custom overlays) without proper sanitization, attackers could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users.

**How `react-native-maps` Contributes:** The library renders user-provided data on the map. If the application doesn't sanitize this data before passing it to `react-native-maps` for rendering, it can lead to XSS.

**Example:** A user could create a marker with a description containing a `<script>` tag that steals cookies or redirects other users.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and output encoding/escaping for all user-provided data displayed on the map.
    *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources.
