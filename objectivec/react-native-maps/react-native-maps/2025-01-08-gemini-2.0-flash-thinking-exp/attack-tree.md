## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Native Bridge Communication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_native_bridge_communication.md)

* Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Data via Bridge [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Inject Malicious Annotation Data [CRITICAL NODE]:
        * Description: Attacker crafts malicious data for map annotations (e.g., title, description) to inject JavaScript code or phishing links.
        * Potential Impact: User compromise through phishing or execution of malicious scripts.
    * Inject Malicious Overlay Data [CRITICAL NODE]:
        * Description: Attacker injects malicious data into map overlays (polygons, polylines) to redirect users to external malicious sites or trigger unintended actions.
        * Potential Impact: User compromise, potential malware infection.
* Attack Vector: Manipulate Native Module Calls [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: Attacker attempts to directly call native functions exposed by `react-native-maps` without proper authorization.
    * Potential Impact: Access to sensitive native resources (e.g., location data), bypassing application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying Native Map SDK Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_native_map_sdk_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit Known Google Maps SDK Vulnerabilities (Android) [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: Attacker leverages publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of the Google Maps SDK used by the application.
    * Potential Impact: Remote code execution, data breach on Android devices.
* Attack Vector: Exploit Known Apple MapsKit Vulnerabilities (iOS) [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: Attacker leverages publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Apple MapsKit used by the application.
    * Potential Impact: Remote code execution, data breach on iOS devices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit User Interaction with the Map](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_user_interaction_with_the_map.md)

* Attack Vector: Tap/Clickjacking on Map Elements [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: Attacker overlays transparent or deceptive elements on top of map elements to trick users into clicking unintended targets.
    * Potential Impact: Unintended actions by the user, potential for financial loss or further compromise.
* Attack Vector: Exploit Custom Callout/Marker Interactions [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: Attacker injects malicious code or links within custom callouts or marker interactions.
    * Potential Impact: Execution of malicious code within the application context, data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration or Integration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_or_integration_issues.md)

* Attack Vector: Expose or Steal API Keys [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: Attacker gains access to API keys used for map services (e.g., Google Maps Platform).
    * Potential Impact: Unauthorized access to backend map services, financial loss due to excessive usage, service disruption.
* Attack Vector: Exploit Insecure Data Storage Related to Maps [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: Sensitive map-related data (e.g., user location history) is stored insecurely on the device.
    * Potential Impact: Privacy breach through unauthorized access to user location data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Third-Party Libraries/Dependencies of react-native-maps](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_third-party_librariesdependencies_of_react-native-maps.md)

* Attack Vector: Leverage Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Description: Attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies used by `react-native-maps`.
    * Potential Impact: Remote code execution, access to sensitive data, full application compromise.
