## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1] Leak Location Data (Improperly Secured API Keys/Tokens) [HR][CN]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1__leak_location_data__improperly_secured_api_keystokens___hr__cn_.md)

Description: This attack vector focuses on the attacker gaining access to the application's API keys or tokens used for accessing map services.  If these keys are not properly secured, the attacker can use them to make requests to the map provider, potentially exceeding usage limits, incurring costs, or accessing restricted data, including user location information if the API key grants such access. This is a *critical node* because it's a gateway to many other potential attacks.
Likelihood: High (Due to common developer mistakes)
Impact: High (API key compromise can lead to significant abuse and data breaches)
Effort: Varies (From Very Low to High, depending on the specific vulnerability)
Skill Level: Varies (From Novice to Advanced)
Detection Difficulty: Varies (From Easy to Hard)

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1.1] Hardcoded API Keys in JavaScript [HR][CN]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1_1__hardcoded_api_keys_in_javascript__hr__cn_.md)

Description: This is the most common and easily exploitable form of API key leakage.  Developers sometimes hardcode API keys directly into the JavaScript source code, which is easily accessible to anyone who can view the application's files (e.g., through a web browser's developer tools or by decompiling a mobile app). This is a *critical node* and part of a *high-risk path*.
Likelihood: Medium (Unfortunately, a common mistake)
Impact: High (Direct and easy access to the API key)
Effort: Very Low (Simply viewing the source code)
Skill Level: Novice
Detection Difficulty: Easy (If you know where to look â€“ code review)

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.3] Spoof Location Data [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_3__spoof_location_data__hr_.md)

Description: This attack vector involves the attacker manipulating the location data reported by the user's device to the application.  This can be used to bypass location-based restrictions, access features intended for other locations, or mislead the application and its users.
Likelihood: High (Especially on Android)
Impact: Medium (Can bypass security measures and provide false information)
Effort: Varies (From Very Low to Medium)
Skill Level: Varies (From Novice to Intermediate)
Detection Difficulty: Varies (From Medium to Hard)

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.3.1] Fake GPS Apps (Android) [HR][CN]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_3_1__fake_gps_apps__android___hr__cn_.md)

Description: On Android, numerous applications are readily available that allow users to mock their GPS location.  These apps can be used by attackers to provide false location data to the React Native application. This is a *critical node* and part of a *high-risk path* due to its ease of use and widespread availability.
Likelihood: High (Very easy to do on Android)
Impact: Medium (Can bypass location-based restrictions or mislead the app)
Effort: Very Low (Simply installing an app)
Skill Level: Novice
Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires using mock location detection techniques)
