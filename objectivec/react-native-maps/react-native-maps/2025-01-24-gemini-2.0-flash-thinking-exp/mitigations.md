# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for react-native-maps/react-native-maps

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Location Data Usage](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_location_data_usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Feature Review:** Analyze each feature in your React Native application that utilizes `react-native-maps`. Determine the minimum location accuracy required for each feature to function correctly with the map.
    2.  **Accuracy Adjustment:** Configure `react-native-maps` and location services to request and utilize only the necessary level of location accuracy. For example, if displaying nearby points of interest, coarse location might suffice instead of precise GPS coordinates.
    3.  **Conditional Location Requests:**  Only request location permissions and access location services when the user interacts with map-related components or features within your `react-native-maps` implementation. Avoid continuous background location tracking unless absolutely essential for the map functionality and clearly communicated to the user.
    4.  **Data Aggregation for Map Analytics:** If using location data for analytics related to map usage patterns, aggregate and anonymize the data to remove personally identifiable information before processing or storing it. Focus on general trends rather than individual user location histories within the map.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privacy Violation (High Severity):**  Unnecessarily precise or frequent location data collection through `react-native-maps` features increases the risk of user privacy breaches.
    *   **Data Breach Exposure (High Severity):** Storing excessive location data obtained via `react-native-maps` increases the potential damage from a data breach, as more sensitive location information could be compromised.
    *   **User Tracking (Medium Severity):** Overly detailed location data collection through map features can enable intrusive user tracking, raising privacy concerns related to `react-native-maps` application usage.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privacy Violation: High Reduction
    *   Data Breach Exposure: High Reduction
    *   User Tracking: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Location is requested when map screen is opened, which is related to `react-native-maps` usage.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to analyze `react-native-maps` features to see if coarse location is sufficient for some map functionalities. Implement data anonymization for map-related analytics.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure API Key Storage](./mitigation_strategies/secure_api_key_storage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment Variables for `react-native-maps` APIs:** Store API keys required by `react-native-maps` (e.g., for Google Maps or other map providers) as environment variables, not directly in the React Native codebase. This prevents accidental exposure in version control.
    2.  **Secure Configuration for `react-native-maps`:** Utilize secure configuration management systems or platform-specific secure storage (like Keychain/Keystore) to manage and retrieve API keys used by `react-native-maps` at runtime.
    3.  **Backend Proxy for Map APIs (Recommended for `react-native-maps`):**  Ideally, implement a backend proxy service to handle map API requests initiated by your `react-native-maps` application. The API key is then securely stored and used only on the backend server, and your React Native app communicates with your backend, not directly with the map provider's API using a client-side key.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposed API Key (High Severity):** Hardcoding API keys for map services used by `react-native-maps` makes them easily discoverable in the application bundle or codebase.
    *   **Unauthorized API Usage (Medium Severity):** Compromised API keys for map services used in `react-native-maps` can be exploited for unauthorized access to map features, potentially incurring costs.
    *   **Quota Exhaustion/Billing Fraud (Medium Severity):** Malicious use of exposed map API keys from `react-native-maps` applications can lead to exceeding API quotas and unexpected billing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposed API Key: High Reduction
    *   Unauthorized API Usage: Medium Reduction
    *   Quota Exhaustion/Billing Fraud: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. API keys are stored as environment variables during build, but direct client-side usage with `react-native-maps` still exists.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a backend proxy for map API requests originating from `react-native-maps`. Migrate to a dedicated secrets management system for API keys used by map services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Key Restriction and Scoping](./mitigation_strategies/api_key_restriction_and_scoping.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Platform Restriction for `react-native-maps` API Keys:** Restrict API keys used by `react-native-maps` to be valid only for the specific platforms (Android, iOS) where your React Native application is deployed.
    2.  **Application Restriction for `react-native-maps` API Keys:** Restrict API keys to specific application identifiers (bundle IDs for iOS, package names for Android) of your React Native application using `react-native-maps`.
    3.  **API Service Restriction for `react-native-maps` APIs:**  If the map provider allows, restrict API keys to only the specific APIs or services required by `react-native-maps` (e.g., Maps SDK, Geocoding API). Limit access to unnecessary services to minimize potential misuse if a key is compromised in the context of `react-native-maps` usage.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Usage (Medium Severity):** Restricting map API keys limits the scope of misuse if a key used by `react-native-maps` is compromised.
    *   **Quota Exhaustion/Billing Fraud (Medium Severity):** Restrictions on map API keys can help prevent unauthorized parties from consuming API quotas and incurring costs related to `react-native-maps` usage.
    *   **API Abuse (Medium Severity):** Limiting the scope of map API keys reduces the potential for attackers to abuse map services beyond the intended functionality within your `react-native-maps` application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized API Usage: Medium Reduction
    *   Quota Exhaustion/Billing Fraud: Medium Reduction
    *   API Abuse: Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes. API keys are restricted by platform and application identifier in the map provider's console for `react-native-maps` usage.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explore further API service restrictions to limit keys to only the necessary map APIs for `react-native-maps`. Implement usage monitoring and alerting for map API keys.
