# Threat Model Analysis for mwaterfall/mwphotobrowser

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Image Decoding Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/uncontrolled_image_decoding_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., extremely large dimensions, compressed in a way that expands massively upon decompression, or using a known vulnerability in an image decoding library that MWPhotoBrowser uses internally) and provides it to the application. When `MWPhotoBrowser` attempts to decode this image internally, it consumes excessive memory or CPU, leading to a crash or unresponsiveness. This is distinct from the application simply passing a large image; this focuses on vulnerabilities *within* MWPhotoBrowser's decoding process.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service for the user. Potentially, the entire device could become unresponsive if memory exhaustion is severe enough.
*   **Affected Component:** The image decoding logic *within* `MWPhotoBrowser`. This likely relies on underlying iOS frameworks like `UIImage` and related image I/O functions (e.g., `imageWithContentsOfFile:`, `imageWithData:`). However, if `MWPhotoBrowser` has *custom* decoding logic for specific image formats or optimizations, that custom code is the primary concern. The methods used for displaying images (e.g., within `MWZoomingScrollView` or related view controllers) are also relevant, as they trigger the decoding.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review MWPhotoBrowser's Code:** Thoroughly review the image loading and decoding code *within* `MWPhotoBrowser` itself. Look for any custom decoding logic or areas where large images might not be handled gracefully.
    *   **Memory Management Audit:** Audit the memory management within `MWPhotoBrowser`'s image handling. Ensure resources are released promptly. Use Instruments to profile memory usage during image loading.
    *   **Fuzz Testing (Targeted):** Perform fuzz testing specifically targeting `MWPhotoBrowser`'s image loading and display components. Provide a wide range of valid *and* invalid/malformed image inputs *directly* to the library's functions (bypassing any application-level validation, to test the library's robustness in isolation).
    *   **Dependency Analysis (Image Libraries):** If `MWPhotoBrowser` uses any *external* libraries for image decoding (check its dependencies), analyze those libraries for known vulnerabilities. Update them if necessary.
    * **Limit Image size and dimensions (within MWPhotoBrowser):** If possible, modify `MWPhotoBrowser`'s code to enforce limits on image size and dimensions *before* attempting to decode. This is a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Caching of Sensitive Images After Logout (If MWPhotoBrowser has its *own* caching)](./threats/caching_of_sensitive_images_after_logout__if_mwphotobrowser_has_its_own_caching_.md)

*   **Description:** A user views sensitive images. `MWPhotoBrowser`'s *internal* caching mechanism (if it has one, independent of `NSURLCache` or `SDWebImage`) stores these images. After logout, these cached images remain accessible, potentially to an attacker with device access. This threat only applies if `MWPhotoBrowser` has its *own*, custom caching implementation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive image data after the user has logged out. Breach of confidentiality.
*   **Affected Component:** Any *custom* caching mechanism implemented *within* `MWPhotoBrowser`. This would likely involve storing image data in files or in-memory data structures. Examine the source code for any such mechanisms. If it *only* relies on `NSURLCache` or `SDWebImage`, this threat is mitigated by clearing *those* caches (which is the application's responsibility).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if the images are sensitive and a custom cache exists)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review (Caching):** Thoroughly review `MWPhotoBrowser`'s source code to determine if it implements any *custom* caching. If so, analyze how this caching works and where the cached data is stored.
    *   **Cache Clearing (Internal):** If a custom cache exists, modify `MWPhotoBrowser` to provide a method for explicitly clearing this cache. The application should call this method on logout.
    *   **Ephemeral Storage (Internal):** If feasible, modify `MWPhotoBrowser`'s custom caching (if it exists) to use ephemeral storage that is automatically cleared by the operating system.
    * **Document Caching Behavior:** Clearly document `MWPhotoBrowser`'s caching behavior (or lack thereof) in its documentation, so developers are aware of their responsibilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly affecting MWPhotoBrowser)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_affecting_mwphotobrowser_.md)

* **Description:** `MWPhotoBrowser` itself depends on other libraries. If these dependencies have known, *high or critical* vulnerabilities that can be exploited through `MWPhotoBrowser`'s functionality, an attacker could compromise the application. This focuses on vulnerabilities in libraries that `MWPhotoBrowser` *directly* uses and that impact its core image handling or display.
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could include denial of service, arbitrary code execution (less likely, but possible), or information disclosure.
* **Affected Component:** Any part of `MWPhotoBrowser` that utilizes a vulnerable dependency. The vulnerability might be triggered through image loading, display, or other library features.
* **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the dependency vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Analysis (Focused):** Specifically analyze the dependencies *directly* used by `MWPhotoBrowser`. Identify any libraries involved in image handling, networking, or other core functions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Dependencies):** Use vulnerability scanning tools to check for known vulnerabilities in `MWPhotoBrowser`'s *direct* dependencies.
    *   **Update Dependencies (MWPhotoBrowser):** Keep `MWPhotoBrowser`'s dependencies up-to-date. If `MWPhotoBrowser` itself is not actively maintained, consider forking it to update its dependencies.
    *   **Alternative Libraries (If Necessary):** If a critical dependency is consistently vulnerable and cannot be updated, consider modifying `MWPhotoBrowser` to use an alternative library or removing the dependency if it's not essential.
