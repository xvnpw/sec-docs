# Attack Surface Analysis for mwaterfall/mwphotobrowser

## Attack Surface: [Image/Video Decoding Exploits](./attack_surfaces/imagevideo_decoding_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in image/video parsing and decoding libraries can lead to crashes, code execution, or information disclosure.
    *   **`mwphotobrowser` Contribution:** `mwphotobrowser` acts as the direct interface for displaying images and videos. It passes image/video data to underlying system frameworks or third-party libraries (e.g., `SDWebImage`) for decoding.  It is the *primary entry point* for potentially malicious image/video data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malformed JPEG image that exploits a buffer overflow in the iOS image decoding library. When `mwphotobrowser` attempts to display this image (passed to it by the application), the attacker gains control of the application's process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High (for DoS or significant information disclosure).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzzing:** Developers should fuzz the image/video decoding components used by the application, *specifically targeting the integration point with `mwphotobrowser`*. This means providing a wide variety of malformed image/video data *through* `mwphotobrowser`'s API.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate the image/video decoding process. Since `mwphotobrowser` is the entry point, ensure the entire component, including `mwphotobrowser` itself, runs within a restricted environment (e.g., App Sandbox on iOS).
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit and update `mwphotobrowser` *and* its dependencies (especially `SDWebImage` or any other image/video handling libraries it uses). Monitor for CVEs related to these libraries. The application team *must* take responsibility for this, not just rely on `mwphotobrowser`'s maintainers.
        *   **Input Validation:** While `mwphotobrowser` might perform *some* internal validation, the application *must* perform its own robust validation of image/video metadata (size, dimensions, type) *before* passing data to `mwphotobrowser`. This acts as a first line of defense.
        * **Memory Safe Libraries:** Advocate for and, if possible, contribute to the use of memory-safe image/video decoding libraries within `mwphotobrowser` and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion) - Directly via `mwphotobrowser`](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion__-_directly_via__mwphotobrowser_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overload `mwphotobrowser` with excessive data, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **`mwphotobrowser` Contribution:** `mwphotobrowser` itself might have internal limitations on the number or size of images/videos it can handle efficiently.  It's the component directly responsible for managing the display of potentially large numbers of images.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a very large number of image URLs to be displayed *through `mwphotobrowser`*, or provides URLs to extremely high-resolution images, causing `mwphotobrowser` to consume all available memory or trigger internal errors.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Image Count Limits:** The application *must* enforce limits on the number of images that can be loaded or displayed simultaneously *within `mwphotobrowser`*. This might involve modifying how the application interacts with the library or contributing upstream to add such limits.
        *   **Image Size Limits:** Enforce maximum dimensions and file sizes for images *before* passing them to `mwphotobrowser`. This prevents `mwphotobrowser` from even attempting to handle excessively large images.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** If images are fetched from remote sources, implement rate limiting *specifically for requests initiated through `mwphotobrowser`*.
        *   **Timeout Handling:** Implement timeouts for image loading and processing *within the context of `mwphotobrowser`'s operations*. This prevents `mwphotobrowser` from hanging indefinitely on a single image.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor the application's resource usage (CPU, memory) *with a focus on the resources consumed by `mwphotobrowser` and its related operations*.
