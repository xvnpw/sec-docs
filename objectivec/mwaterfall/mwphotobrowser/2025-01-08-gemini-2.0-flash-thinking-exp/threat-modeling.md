# Threat Model Analysis for mwaterfall/mwphotobrowser

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Image URLs](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_image_urls.md)

**Description:** If `mwphotobrowser` directly loads and attempts to render content from a URL provided as an image source, an attacker could craft a URL that, when fetched, serves JavaScript code disguised as an image (e.g., with an incorrect MIME type or by embedding JavaScript within image data). When `mwphotobrowser` processes this "image," the browser executes the malicious script.

**Impact:** Successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or other client-side attacks.

**Affected Component:** Image loading mechanism within `mwphotobrowser`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, including images.
*   Ensure `mwphotobrowser` validates the content type of fetched resources to strictly enforce that only actual images are processed.
*   Avoid directly rendering user-provided URLs without thorough validation and sanitization. If possible, fetch and serve images from your own domain or a trusted CDN.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Image Metadata](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_image_metadata.md)

**Description:** If `mwphotobrowser` parses and displays image metadata (e.g., EXIF, IPTC) without proper sanitization, an attacker could upload or link to an image containing malicious JavaScript embedded within this metadata. When `mwphotobrowser` displays the metadata, the embedded script could be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Similar to XSS via image URLs, leading to session hijacking, data theft, redirection, or other client-side attacks.

**Affected Component:** Metadata processing and display functionality within `mwphotobrowser`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid displaying image metadata from untrusted sources.
*   If metadata needs to be displayed, implement robust sanitization techniques within `mwphotobrowser` to remove any potentially malicious scripts before rendering.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large or Malformed Images](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_or_malformed_images.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide URLs to extremely large images or images with intentionally malformed data. When `mwphotobrowser` attempts to load and render these images, it could consume excessive client-side resources (CPU, memory), potentially causing the user's browser to freeze or crash. This vulnerability lies within `mwphotobrowser`'s image processing capabilities if it lacks proper safeguards against resource-intensive operations.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or unusable for the targeted user due to browser instability.

**Affected Component:** Image rendering and display logic within `mwphotobrowser`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement checks within `mwphotobrowser` to limit the maximum size of images it will attempt to load and process.
*   Set timeouts for image loading and rendering operations within `mwphotobrowser` to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
*   Ensure robust error handling within `mwphotobrowser` to gracefully handle malformed image data without crashing the browser.
