# Attack Surface Analysis for mwaterfall/mwphotobrowser

## Attack Surface: [Caption Injection](./attack_surfaces/caption_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Caption Injection

    *   **Description:** Injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the `caption` property of `MWPhoto` objects.
    *   **How MWPhotoBrowser Contributes:** The library renders the provided `caption` content within the photo browser interface, potentially executing any embedded scripts.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Setting the caption to `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` which could execute JavaScript when the image fails to load.
        *   Embedding malicious links that could phish users or lead to other attacks.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the context of the application.
        *   Potential for session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Sanitize all user-provided input that will be used as captions before passing it to `MWPhotoBrowser`. Use appropriate HTML escaping or sanitization libraries to remove or neutralize potentially malicious code.
        *   **Developer:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.
