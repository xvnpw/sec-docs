### High and Critical Attack Surface List Involving MWPhotoBrowser:

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious Image URLs
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted URL that, when processed by MWPhotoBrowser, leads to unintended consequences.
    *   **How MWPhotoBrowser Contributes:** MWPhotoBrowser directly fetches and attempts to display images from URLs provided to it. It doesn't inherently validate the safety or legitimacy of these URLs.
    *   **Example:** A user is tricked into clicking a link that opens an image gallery using MWPhotoBrowser. One of the image URLs points to an internal server resource (e.g., `http://internal.server/admin/delete_user?id=1`). When MWPhotoBrowser attempts to load this "image," it triggers the unintended action on the internal server (Server-Side Request Forgery - SSRF).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of internal services or data.
        *   Unauthorized actions on internal systems.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) against internal or external resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict server-side validation of image URLs before passing them to MWPhotoBrowser. Use allow-lists of trusted domains or URL patterns.
            *   Enforce the use of HTTPS for image URLs to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which images can be loaded.
            *   Sanitize or validate any data derived from the image URL (e.g., filenames if used for local storage).
