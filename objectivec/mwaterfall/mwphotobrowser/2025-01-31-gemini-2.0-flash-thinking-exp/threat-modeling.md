# Threat Model Analysis for mwaterfall/mwphotobrowser

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Image Metadata](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_image_metadata.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into image metadata fields (e.g., EXIF, IPTC, captions). When `mwphotobrowser` renders this metadata without proper sanitization, the malicious script executes in the user's browser. This can be achieved by uploading a specially crafted image to a system that stores and serves images to the application using `mwphotobrowser`.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the webpage, redirection to malicious websites, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected Component:** Metadata rendering module within `mwphotobrowser`, specifically the part responsible for displaying image information like captions or descriptions derived from metadata.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Sanitization:** Sanitize and encode all user-supplied data and image metadata on the server-side *before* storing it. Use a robust HTML sanitization library to remove or neutralize potentially malicious scripts.
    *   **Client-Side Output Encoding:** Ensure `mwphotobrowser` properly encodes metadata before rendering it in the HTML DOM. Use browser-provided encoding functions to prevent interpretation of HTML tags and JavaScript.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources and restrict inline JavaScript execution. This can mitigate the impact of XSS even if it occurs.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS in mwphotobrowser JavaScript](./threats/dom-based_xss_in_mwphotobrowser_javascript.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `mwphotobrowser`'s JavaScript code allow an attacker to manipulate the DOM based on attacker-controlled input. This input could be through URL parameters, image paths, or other client-side data. An attacker crafts a malicious URL or input that, when processed by `mwphotobrowser`, injects and executes JavaScript code within the user's browser context.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, similar to reflected or stored XSS. Consequences include session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, redirection, and unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Component:** Core JavaScript modules of `mwphotobrowser` responsible for handling user input, URL parsing, and DOM manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review and Security Audits:** Conduct thorough security code reviews and penetration testing of `mwphotobrowser`'s JavaScript code to identify and fix potential DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `mwphotobrowser` updated to the latest version. Developers often release patches for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization within mwphotobrowser:** If possible and if you are modifying `mwphotobrowser`, implement input validation and sanitization within the library itself to handle potentially malicious input.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strong CSP to reduce the impact of DOM-based XSS by controlling resource loading and restricting inline script execution.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** `mwphotobrowser` or its dependencies (if any) might contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are not patched.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities could lead to various attacks, including XSS, code execution, DoS, or other security breaches, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:**  Dependencies of `mwphotobrowser` and potentially `mwphotobrowser` itself if it has known vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, yarn audit, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in `mwphotobrowser` and its dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `mwphotobrowser` and its dependencies updated to the latest versions. Apply security patches promptly.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to JavaScript libraries to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA practices to manage and track dependencies and their vulnerabilities throughout the software development lifecycle.
