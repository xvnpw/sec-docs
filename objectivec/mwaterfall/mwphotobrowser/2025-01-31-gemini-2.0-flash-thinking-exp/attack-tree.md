## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Image Path Handling (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_image_path_handling__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector: Path Traversal (Local File Inclusion - LFI) (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Specific Attack: Manipulate Image Path Parameter in URL (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Attacker crafts a URL for the application using `mwphotobrowser` and manipulates the image path parameter. This parameter is designed to specify the location of images to be displayed by `mwphotobrowser`.
        *   **Exploitation:** The attacker injects path traversal sequences like `../` into the image path parameter. If `mwphotobrowser` or the backend application processes this path without proper sanitization, it can lead to accessing files outside the intended image directory.
        *   **Example:**  `https://example.com/photobrowser?imagePath=../../../../etc/passwd`
        *   **Potential Impact:**
            *   **Read Sensitive Files:** Access to system files like `/etc/passwd`, application configuration files, or other sensitive data on the server.
            *   **Server Compromise (in severe cases):** If application code or configuration files are exposed, it could lead to further exploitation and potentially server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__cross-site_scripting_-_xss___critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector: Reflected XSS (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Specific Attack: Inject Malicious JavaScript via Image Path Parameter (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the image path parameter.
        *   **Exploitation:** If `mwphotobrowser` or the application reflects this image path parameter in the HTML response (e.g., in error messages, image display, or UI elements) without proper output encoding, the injected JavaScript code will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
        *   **Example:** `https://example.com/photobrowser?imagePath=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
        *   **Potential Impact:**
            *   **Session Hijacking:** Steal user session cookies and impersonate the user.
            *   **Account Takeover:** Potentially gain control of the user's account.
            *   **Defacement:** Modify the content of the web page displayed to the user.
            *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware into the page.

*   **Attack Vector: DOM-Based XSS (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Specific Attack: Manipulate DOM through Image Path or Configuration (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Attacker crafts malicious image paths or configuration values that, when processed by `mwphotobrowser`'s JavaScript code, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in a way that executes attacker-controlled JavaScript.
        *   **Exploitation:** This typically occurs when `mwphotobrowser` uses JavaScript to dynamically update the page content based on user-provided data (image paths, configuration) using unsafe methods like `innerHTML` without proper sanitization.
        *   **Example:**  Crafting an image path that, when processed by `mwphotobrowser`'s JavaScript, injects a `<script>` tag into the DOM.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to Reflected XSS: Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement, malware distribution.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/5__dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector: Vulnerable JavaScript Libraries (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Specific Attack: mwphotobrowser uses a JavaScript library with known vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** `mwphotobrowser` might rely on external JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery, Lodash, etc.) to function. If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities and `mwphotobrowser` uses a vulnerable version, the application becomes susceptible to exploits targeting those vulnerabilities.
        *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in the outdated JavaScript libraries used by `mwphotobrowser`. These vulnerabilities could range from XSS to more severe issues like prototype pollution or even remote code execution in certain scenarios (though less likely in a purely client-side context, but possible if vulnerabilities are severe or interact with backend).
        *   **Example:** If `mwphotobrowser` uses an old version of jQuery with a known XSS vulnerability, an attacker could exploit that jQuery vulnerability through interactions with `mwphotobrowser`.
        *   **Potential Impact:**
            *   **Depends on the vulnerability:** Could range from XSS (client-side compromise) to potentially more severe impacts if the vulnerability allows for more than just client-side script execution (though less common in client-side libraries, but not impossible).
