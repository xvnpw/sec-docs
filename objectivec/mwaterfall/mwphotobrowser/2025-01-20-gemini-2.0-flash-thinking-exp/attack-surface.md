# Attack Surface Analysis for mwaterfall/mwphotobrowser

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Image URLs](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_image_urls.md)

*   **Description:** The application provides image URLs to `mwphotobrowser` for display. If these URLs are not properly validated, it can lead to various security issues.
    *   **How `mwphotobrowser` Contributes:** `mwphotobrowser` directly fetches and displays content from the provided URLs. It doesn't inherently validate the safety or origin of these URLs.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate the `photos` array to include a URL pointing to an internal server resource (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin/sensitive_data`). When `mwphotobrowser` attempts to load this URL, it could inadvertently expose internal information or trigger actions on the internal server (SSRF).
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), potential access to internal resources, Denial of Service (if the URL points to a large file or resource-intensive endpoint).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Validation:** Implement strict server-side validation of image URLs before passing them to `mwphotobrowser`. Use allowlists of trusted domains or URL patterns.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure CSP headers to restrict the origins from which images can be loaded.
        *   **Avoid User-Controlled URLs:** If possible, avoid directly using user-provided URLs. Instead, use identifiers that map to internally managed image resources.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Captions](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_captions.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows user-provided captions for images and doesn't sanitize them before passing them to `mwphotobrowser`, malicious scripts can be injected.
    *   **How `mwphotobrowser` Contributes:** `mwphotobrowser` renders the provided caption text within the user interface. If this rendering doesn't properly escape or sanitize HTML, injected scripts can execute.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could provide a caption like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` or `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When `mwphotobrowser` renders this caption, the JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side sanitization of caption data before passing it to `mwphotobrowser`. Use a library specifically designed for HTML sanitization.
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure that when `mwphotobrowser` renders captions, it uses context-aware output encoding to prevent the interpretation of HTML tags.
        *   **Consider using a safe subset of HTML:** If rich text formatting is required, use a carefully curated allowlist of safe HTML tags and attributes.
