# Threat Model Analysis for mwaterfall/mwphotobrowser

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Image URLs](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_image_urls.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide a crafted image URL containing malicious JavaScript code. When `mwphotobrowser` attempts to load or render this "image," the script executes within the user's browser context. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform actions on behalf of the user. This directly involves `mwphotobrowser`'s image loading functionality.

**Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the user's session and potential data breach.

**Affected Component:** Image loading functionality within `mwphotobrowser`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* The application must implement strict allowlisting of allowed protocols (e.g., `http:`, `https:`) for image URLs *before* passing them to `mwphotobrowser`.
* While not a direct fix within `mwphotobrowser`, developers using the library must sanitize and validate all user-provided image URLs.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large or Malformed Images](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_or_malformed_images.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides URLs to extremely large or malformed image files. When `mwphotobrowser` attempts to load and render these images, it can consume excessive client-side resources (CPU, memory), leading to browser slowdown, unresponsiveness, or crashes. This is a direct consequence of how `mwphotobrowser` handles image loading and rendering.

**Impact:** Medium. Application becomes unusable for the user.

**Affected Component:** Image loading and rendering functionality within `mwphotobrowser`.

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement client-side checks on image file sizes *before* passing URLs to `mwphotobrowser`.
* Consider setting timeouts for image loading operations within the application that uses `mwphotobrowser`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `mwphotobrowser` Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__mwphotobrowser__dependencies.md)

**Description:** `mwphotobrowser` might rely on other JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could compromise the application. This is a direct risk associated with the libraries `mwphotobrowser` depends on.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability, potentially ranging from low to critical.

**Affected Component:** The entire `mwphotobrowser` library, indirectly through its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `mwphotobrowser` to the latest version to benefit from dependency updates and security patches.
* Developers using `mwphotobrowser` should use dependency scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the project's dependency tree, including `mwphotobrowser`'s dependencies.
