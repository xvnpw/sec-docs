# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
 - The project 'mjextension' is an Objective-C library designed to simplify the process of converting JSON data to Objective-C models and vice versa.
 - The primary business goal for a company using 'mjextension' would be to increase developer productivity by automating and streamlining data handling tasks in iOS and macOS application development.
 - This can lead to faster development cycles, reduced code complexity, and easier maintenance of applications that rely on JSON data.
 - By simplifying data mapping, 'mjextension' can also contribute to improved data consistency and reduced errors in data processing within applications.

- Most important business risks:
 - Dependency risk: Reliance on an external, open-source library introduces a dependency risk. If the library is not actively maintained, contains bugs, or introduces security vulnerabilities, it can negatively impact applications that depend on it.
 - Compatibility risk: Changes in the library or in the JSON data structures it processes could lead to compatibility issues, requiring application updates and potentially causing downtime.
 - Performance risk: Inefficient data conversion or memory leaks within the library could negatively impact the performance and stability of applications using 'mjextension'.
 - Security vulnerability risk: Security flaws in 'mjextension' could be exploited to compromise applications that use it, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
 - Data integrity risk: Incorrect data mapping or conversion by the library could lead to data corruption or inconsistencies within applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
 - security control: Source code is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
 - security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and potential security audits. (Implemented: Open-source nature)
 - security control: Basic unit tests are present in the repository, which can help catch some functional bugs, indirectly contributing to data integrity. (Implemented: `MJExtensionTests` directory)

- Accepted risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security updates and vulnerability patching. Response time to security issues may vary.
 - accepted risk: No formal security audit has been conducted on the library. Potential vulnerabilities may exist.
 - accepted risk: Limited security testing is evident in the provided repository. Deeper security analysis might be needed depending on the sensitivity of the data being processed in applications using this library.
 - accepted risk: Supply chain risk associated with using an external dependency. The library's dependencies are managed by CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager, which themselves introduce supply chain considerations.

- Recommended security controls:
 - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies.
 - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development workflow to automatically scan the library's code for potential security flaws.
 - security control: Establish a process for monitoring security advisories related to Objective-C and JSON processing libraries and frameworks.
 - security control: Encourage and facilitate community security contributions by providing clear guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities and contributing security patches.
 - security control: If the library is used in applications handling sensitive data, consider performing a formal security audit or penetration testing of applications that utilize 'mjextension'.

- Security requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is relevant for systems that *use* the library, but not the library itself.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is relevant for systems that *use* the library, but not the library itself.
 - Input validation:
  - security requirement: The library must robustly handle invalid or malformed JSON input to prevent crashes, unexpected behavior, or potential vulnerabilities like denial-of-service.
  - security requirement: Input validation should be performed on JSON data to ensure it conforms to expected schemas and data types before attempting to map it to Objective-C models.
 - Cryptography:
  - security requirement: If the library is intended to handle or process sensitive data that requires encryption, it should either integrate with established cryptographic libraries securely or clearly document that it is not designed for handling encrypted data and should not be used in such contexts without additional security measures in the consuming application. For a data mapping library, cryptography is likely handled at the application level, not within the library itself.

## DEPLOYMENT

- Deployment Architecture Options:
 - Option 1: Direct integration into application binary: The 'mjextension' library is compiled and linked directly into the mobile application binary during the application build process. This is the most common deployment method for libraries used in mobile apps.
 - Option 2: Dynamic library (less common for mobile): In some scenarios, the library could be packaged as a dynamic library, but for mobile apps, static linking is generally preferred for simplicity and performance.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
 - The critical business process is the functionality of mobile applications that rely on 'mjextension' for data handling. This includes features that display data fetched from backend systems, process user input, and generally interact with JSON data. Disruption or compromise of this library could impact the functionality and reliability of these applications. Data integrity within these applications is also a key concern.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
 - The data being processed by 'mjextension' is JSON data. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the context of the applications using the library.
 - Potential data sensitivity levels:
  - Public data: If the JSON data is publicly available and non-sensitive, the risk is lower. However, data integrity is still important to ensure application functionality.
  - Internal data: If the JSON data is internal company data, such as configuration settings or non-sensitive operational data, confidentiality and integrity are more important.
  - Sensitive personal data (PII): If the JSON data includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, health records, or other sensitive data, then confidentiality, integrity, and availability are critical. Security breaches could lead to regulatory compliance issues, reputational damage, and harm to users.
  - Highly confidential data: In some cases, the JSON data might contain trade secrets, intellectual property, or other highly confidential information. In these scenarios, any compromise could have severe business consequences.
