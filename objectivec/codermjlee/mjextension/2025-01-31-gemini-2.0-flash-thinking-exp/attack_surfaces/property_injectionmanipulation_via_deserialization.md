#### 4.1. Understanding `mjextension`'s Role in Property Mapping

`mjextension` is a powerful Objective-C library designed to simplify the process of converting between JSON data and Objective-C objects.  Its core functionality revolves around automatically mapping JSON keys to Objective-C properties. This mapping is typically based on naming conventions (e.g., snake_case in JSON to camelCase in Objective-C) and can be customized through various configuration options provided by `mjextension`.

**How `mjextension` Contributes to the Attack Surface:**

*   **Automatic Mapping:** The very feature that makes `mjextension` convenient – automatic property mapping – is also the root cause of this attack surface.  `mjextension` by default attempts to set properties of an Objective-C object based on the keys present in the incoming JSON. If an object has properties that are intended for internal use only and should not be set from external input, `mjextension` might still attempt to set them if a matching key is found in the JSON.
*   **Accessibility Assumption:** `mjextension` operates under the assumption that if a property exists and its name matches a JSON key (or can be mapped), it is intended to be populated from the JSON data. It doesn't inherently enforce access control or differentiate between properties meant for external input and those that are purely internal.
*   **Lack of Default Filtering:** By default, `mjextension` does not provide built-in mechanisms to automatically filter out or ignore specific properties during deserialization.  While customization options exist (discussed later in mitigation), developers must explicitly configure these features to prevent unintended property setting.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Breakdown and Exploitation Scenarios

The vulnerability arises when developers rely solely on `mjextension` for deserialization without implementing proper access control and input validation for their Objective-C objects. This can lead to attackers manipulating application state by injecting or modifying properties that should be protected.

**Exploitation Scenarios:**

1.  **Privilege Escalation (Example: `isAdminUser`):**

    *   **Scenario:** As described in the initial attack surface description, consider a `User` class with an `isAdminUser` property (boolean). This property is intended to be set only by administrative functions within the application.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker, by controlling the JSON payload sent to the application (e.g., through a compromised API request, manipulated web form, or crafted mobile app input), includes `"isAdminUser": true` in the JSON.
    *   **Impact:** If the application deserializes this JSON into a `User` object using `mjextension` without filtering or validation, the `isAdminUser` property of the user object might be unexpectedly set to `true`. This could grant the attacker unauthorized administrative privileges, allowing them to perform actions they are not supposed to.

2.  **Data Manipulation (Example: `accountBalance`):**

    *   **Scenario:** An `Account` class has an `accountBalance` property (numeric) representing the user's account balance. This property should only be updated through authorized transaction processes.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload with `"accountBalance": 999999999.99` and sends it to an endpoint that deserializes JSON into an `Account` object using `mjextension`.
    *   **Impact:** If the application doesn't validate or filter the input, the `accountBalance` property could be directly set to the attacker-controlled value. This could lead to financial fraud, incorrect reporting, and disruption of financial operations.

3.  **Configuration Tampering (Example: `debugModeEnabled`):**

    *   **Scenario:** A `Settings` class has a `debugModeEnabled` property (boolean) that controls whether debug mode is active in the application. This should only be toggled by authorized developers or administrators.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker injects `"debugModeEnabled": true` into a JSON payload targeting an endpoint that deserializes into a `Settings` object.
    *   **Impact:** Enabling debug mode unintentionally could expose sensitive debugging information, bypass security checks intended for production, or alter application behavior in ways that benefit the attacker (e.g., revealing hidden functionalities or vulnerabilities).

4.  **State Manipulation (Example: `orderStatus`):**

    *   **Scenario:** An `Order` class has an `orderStatus` property (enum or string) representing the current status of an order (e.g., "pending", "processing", "shipped", "delivered"). Order status transitions should be managed by the application's business logic.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with `"orderStatus": "delivered"` for an order they placed but hasn't been shipped yet.
    *   **Impact:** Directly setting the `orderStatus` could bypass the normal order fulfillment process, potentially leading to premature order completion, incorrect inventory management, or fraudulent claims.

#### 4.3. Risk Severity Assessment

The risk severity of this attack surface is indeed **High to Critical**.

*   **High:** In many applications, property injection can lead to significant data breaches, unauthorized access, and disruption of services.
*   **Critical:** If sensitive properties controlling core application logic, access control, or financial transactions are vulnerable to manipulation, the risk escalates to **Critical**.  Successful exploitation can have severe consequences for the application, its users, and the organization.

The severity depends heavily on:

*   **Sensitivity of Properties:** The more sensitive the properties that can be manipulated, the higher the risk. Properties related to authentication, authorization, financial data, configuration, and critical business logic are high-value targets.
*   **Application Logic Reliance:** If the application heavily relies on the integrity of these properties for its security and functionality, the impact of manipulation is amplified.
*   **Exposure of Endpoints:** Endpoints that accept JSON payloads and deserialize them into objects without proper input validation are potential entry points for this attack.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and `mjextension`-Specific)

To effectively mitigate the "Property Injection/Manipulation via Deserialization" attack surface when using `mjextension`, development teams should implement a combination of the following strategies:

#### 5.1. Principle of Least Privilege and Property Access Control

*   **Utilize Access Modifiers:**  Employ Objective-C access modifiers (`@private`, `@protected`, `@public`) judiciously.
    *   **`@private`:**  Make properties that should *never* be set from outside the class `@private`. This is the strongest form of protection at the language level. `mjextension` will not be able to set `@private` properties directly from JSON.
    *   **`@protected`:** Use `@protected` for properties that should only be accessible within the class and its subclasses. While subclasses might still be vulnerable if they use `mjextension` carelessly, it provides a degree of protection from external JSON input.
    *   **`@public`:**  Reserve `@public` for properties that are genuinely intended to be publicly accessible and modifiable. Minimize the use of `@public` for sensitive properties.

*   **Read-Only Properties (`readonly`):** For properties that should be set internally but not modified externally (even through deserialization), declare them as `readonly`.  `mjextension` will not be able to set `readonly` properties from JSON.

*   **Consider Property Attributes:**  Carefully choose property attributes like `nonatomic` vs. `atomic` and `strong`, `weak`, `assign`, `copy` based on the property's purpose and thread-safety requirements. While not directly related to property injection, correct attribute usage contributes to overall secure and robust code.

**Example (Least Privilege):**

```objectivec
@interface Configuration : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, readonly, strong) NSString *applicationName; // Read-only, set internally
@property (nonatomic, private, assign) BOOL isAdminUser;         // Private, only set internally
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL isDebugModeEnabled;         // Public, intended for external configuration (with validation)
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *apiEndpoint;           // Public, intended for external configuration (with validation)
@end
```

#### 5.2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

*   **Decouple External Input from Internal Models:**  Create separate DTO classes specifically designed to receive and validate external JSON data. These DTOs should only contain properties that are safe to be directly set from external input.
*   **Mapping and Validation Layer:** After deserializing JSON into DTOs using `mjextension`, implement a mapping and validation layer to transfer data from DTOs to your internal model objects. This layer should perform:
    *   **Validation:**  Check if the values in the DTO are valid and within acceptable ranges.
    *   **Authorization:**  Verify if the user or source is authorized to modify the corresponding data.
    *   **Controlled Mapping:**  Explicitly map only the allowed properties from the DTO to the internal model, ignoring or rejecting any unexpected or unauthorized properties.

**Example (DTO Approach):**

```objectivec
// DTO for receiving user profile updates
@interface UserProfileDTO : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *email;
// Note: isAdminUser is NOT in the DTO
@end

// Internal User model
@interface User : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *email;
@property (nonatomic, private, assign) BOOL isAdminUser; // Protected property
@end

// Deserialization and Mapping Logic
- (void)updateUserProfileFromJSONData:(NSData *)jsonData {
    UserProfileDTO *dto = [UserProfileDTO mj_objectWithKeyValues:jsonData];
    if (dto) {
        // Validation (example)
        if (dto.name.length > 100) {
            // Handle validation error
            return;
        }
        // Authorization check (example - based on user session)
        if (![self isUserAuthorizedToUpdateProfile]) {
            // Handle authorization error
            return;
        }

        User *user = [self getCurrentUser]; // Get the internal User object
        user.name = dto.name; // Map allowed properties
        user.email = dto.email;
        // isAdminUser remains untouched, as intended

        // Save updated user object
    } else {
        // Handle deserialization error
    }
}
```

#### 5.3. Property Filtering/Ignoring with `mjextension`

*   **`mj_ignoredPropertyNames`:** `mjextension` provides the `mj_ignoredPropertyNames` class method (or instance method if needed) that allows you to specify an array of property names that should be ignored during deserialization. This is a direct and effective way to prevent specific sensitive properties from being set from JSON.

**Example (`mj_ignoredPropertyNames`):**

```objectivec
@interface Configuration : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL isAdminUser;
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL isDebugModeEnabled;
// ... other properties
@end

@implementation Configuration
+ (NSArray *)mj_ignoredPropertyNames {
    return @[@"isAdminUser"]; // Ignore isAdminUser during deserialization
}
@end

// Now, even if JSON contains "isAdminUser": true, it will be ignored
Configuration *config = [Configuration mj_objectWithKeyValues:jsonData];
// config.isAdminUser will NOT be set from JSON
```

*   **`mj_replacedKeyFromPropertyName` (and similar methods):** While primarily for key mapping, these methods can also be used indirectly for filtering. You could potentially map a sensitive property to a "dummy" key in JSON, and then not implement the reverse mapping, effectively preventing it from being set during deserialization. However, `mj_ignoredPropertyNames` is generally a cleaner and more direct approach for ignoring properties.

#### 5.4. Input Validation and Authorization (Post-Deserialization)

*   **Always Validate Deserialized Data:** Even with DTOs and property filtering, it's crucial to implement robust input validation *after* deserialization.  Validate:
    *   **Data Type:** Ensure properties have the expected data types.
    *   **Range and Format:** Check if values are within acceptable ranges and conform to expected formats (e.g., string length, numeric limits, date formats).
    *   **Business Rules:** Validate against application-specific business rules and constraints.

*   **Implement Authorization Checks:**  Before applying changes based on deserialized data, always perform authorization checks to ensure that the user or source is permitted to make those changes. This is especially critical for sensitive properties or actions.

*   **Fail Securely:** If validation or authorization fails, handle the error gracefully and securely.  Reject the request, log the attempt (for security monitoring), and return appropriate error responses to the client. Avoid applying any potentially malicious changes.

#### 5.5. Secure Coding Practices and Code Review

*   **Security-Focused Design:** Design your Objective-C classes and APIs with security in mind from the outset.  Minimize publicly settable properties, use DTOs for external input, and implement validation and authorization at each layer.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where `mjextension` is used for deserialization.  Reviewers should look for potential property injection vulnerabilities and ensure that mitigation strategies are correctly implemented.
*   **Security Testing:** Include security testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning) as part of your development lifecycle. Test for property injection vulnerabilities by crafting malicious JSON payloads and observing application behavior.
*   **Stay Updated:** Keep up-to-date with security best practices for Objective-C development and the `mjextension` library. Monitor for any reported vulnerabilities or security advisories related to `mjextension` or deserialization in general.

### 6. Conclusion

The "Property Injection/Manipulation via Deserialization" attack surface is a significant security concern when using `mjextension` (and similar automatic deserialization libraries) in Objective-C applications.  While `mjextension` simplifies JSON handling, it's crucial to understand its potential security implications and implement robust mitigation strategies.

By adopting a defense-in-depth approach that combines least privilege principles, DTOs, property filtering (using `mjextension` features), rigorous input validation, authorization checks, and secure coding practices, development teams can effectively minimize this attack surface and build more secure applications.  Ignoring this risk can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of critical application functionalities.  Therefore, proactive security measures are essential when leveraging the convenience of libraries like `mjextension`.
