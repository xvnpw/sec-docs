# Threat Model Analysis for codermjlee/mjextension

## Threat: [Property Injection/Modification](./threats/property_injectionmodification.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Property Injection/Modification
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts JSON data to inject or modify object properties beyond what is intended by the application. If `mjextension` is used to directly map JSON to application objects without careful control over property mapping, an attacker can manipulate object state. This could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or modification of sensitive data if object properties control application behavior or security settings. The attacker exploits the automatic mapping feature of `mjextension` to influence object properties.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized modification of application state.
    *   Privilege escalation if injected properties control access rights.
    *   Bypass of security controls or authorization checks.
    *   Data integrity compromise due to unintended property changes.
*   **Affected mjextension component:**
    *   `mj_objectWithKeyValues:` and related functions responsible for mapping JSON keys to object properties.
    *   Potentially configuration options related to property mapping if misused.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Whitelist Property Mapping:**  Explicitly define which properties should be mapped from JSON to objects. Avoid automatic or wildcard mapping of all JSON keys. Use `mjextension`'s features to control and restrict property mapping to only necessary and safe attributes.
    *   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Use dedicated Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for receiving JSON data. Map JSON to DTOs first, then validate and transfer only safe and necessary data from DTOs to application domain objects.
    *   **Immutable Objects:** Where feasible, use immutable objects for critical application state. This limits the ability of `mjextension` to directly modify object properties after creation.
    *   **Access Control Post-Deserialization:** Implement access control and authorization checks *after* object population to verify data integrity and prevent unauthorized actions based on potentially manipulated properties.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known mjextension Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_mjextension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Known mjextension Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** Publicly known vulnerabilities might exist in specific versions of `mjextension`. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of the library. Exploits could range from DoS to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Attackers leverage publicly available vulnerability information and exploit code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) - potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   Information Disclosure.
    *   Data manipulation or corruption.
*   **Affected mjextension component:**
    *   Depends on the specific vulnerability. Could affect any part of the library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE), High (if DoS or Information Disclosure) - Severity depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update mjextension:** Keep `mjextension` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automatically scan application dependencies (including `mjextension`) for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `mjextension` and its ecosystem to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Patch Management:** Establish a robust patch management process to quickly apply security updates to `mjextension` and other dependencies when vulnerabilities are disclosed.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Unpatched mjextension Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_unpatched_mjextension_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Unpatched mjextension Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** Undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities might exist in `mjextension`. If the library is not actively maintained or if vulnerabilities are discovered but not promptly fixed, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities. This is a risk associated with relying on any third-party library, especially if its maintenance status is uncertain. Attackers may discover zero-day vulnerabilities or exploit known but unpatched issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   Information Disclosure.
    *   Data manipulation or corruption.
*   **Affected mjextension component:**
    *   Depends on the specific vulnerability. Could affect any part of the library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for critical impact depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Assess Library Maintenance:** Evaluate the maintenance status and community activity of `mjextension`. Consider the risk of relying on a library that is not actively maintained.
    *   **Security Testing:** Incorporate security testing (fuzzing, static analysis, penetration testing) into the development process to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities in `mjextension` and its usage.
    *   **Code Audits:** Conduct regular code audits of the application and its dependencies, including `mjextension`, to identify potential security weaknesses.
    *   **Incident Response Plan:** Have an incident response plan in place to handle potential security incidents, including vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   **Contingency Plan:** Develop a contingency plan to migrate away from `mjextension` if it becomes unmaintained or if critical unpatched vulnerabilities are discovered.
