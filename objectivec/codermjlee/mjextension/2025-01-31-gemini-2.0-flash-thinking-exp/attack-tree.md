## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Misuse or Misconfiguration of MJExtension in Application Code](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_misuse_or_misconfiguration_of_mjextension_in_application_code.md)

* **Attack Vector Theme:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how developers use MJExtension in their application, rather than flaws within MJExtension itself. The core issue is incorrect or insecure implementation around the library.
* **General Attack Vectors:**
    * **Logical Exploitation:**  Abusing the application's logic that relies on data processed by MJExtension. If the application makes incorrect assumptions about the data's integrity or format after MJExtension parsing, attackers can manipulate input to bypass security checks or alter application behavior.
    * **Data Manipulation:**  Injecting malicious data through JSON/XML input that, when parsed by MJExtension and used by the application, leads to unintended data modification, corruption, or leakage.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crafting JSON/XML payloads that, when processed by MJExtension and the application, consume excessive resources, leading to application slowdown or unavailability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Lack of Input Validation Before MJExtension Processing](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__lack_of_input_validation_before_mjextension_processing.md)

* **Attack Vector Theme:** This is the most critical high-risk path. It highlights the danger of directly feeding untrusted JSON/XML data to MJExtension without proper validation and sanitization beforehand.
* **Specific Attack Vectors:**
    * **Injection Attacks (Generic):**  Since no validation is performed, attackers can inject various types of malicious data within the JSON/XML structure. The specific impact depends on how the application uses the parsed data. This could potentially lead to:
        * **Data Injection:** Injecting malicious data into the application's data stores or internal processing.
        * **Logic Injection:**  Manipulating application logic by injecting unexpected data values or structures that cause the application to behave in unintended ways.
    * **Parsing Exploits (Indirect):** While MJExtension itself is likely robust, lack of validation can expose the application to issues arising from how *it* handles the *parsed output* of MJExtension. For example, if the application expects a string but receives a very long string due to missing input length validation, it might lead to buffer overflows or other memory-related issues in the application code *after* MJExtension parsing.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) via Payload Size/Complexity:** Sending extremely large or deeply nested JSON/XML payloads that MJExtension *can* parse, but which then overwhelm the application's resources when it attempts to process the resulting objects. This is a DoS at the application level, triggered by unvalidated input processed by MJExtension.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Application Accepts Untrusted JSON/XML Input](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__application_accepts_untrusted_jsonxml_input.md)

* **Attack Vector Theme:** This node emphasizes the entry point for attacks. If the application accepts JSON/XML from untrusted sources (users, external APIs without proper authentication/authorization, etc.), it becomes vulnerable if subsequent validation is missing.
* **Specific Attack Vectors:**
    * **Unauthenticated/Unauthorized Access Points:** Attackers target application endpoints or functionalities that process JSON/XML input without proper authentication or authorization checks. This allows them to send malicious payloads without restriction.
    * **Publicly Accessible APIs:** Publicly facing APIs that accept JSON/XML are prime targets if input validation is weak or missing. Attackers can easily send crafted payloads to these APIs.
    * **User-Supplied Data:**  Any application feature that allows users to upload or input JSON/XML data (e.g., configuration files, data import features) is a potential attack vector if this data is not validated before being processed by MJExtension.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2. Input Not Sanitized or Validated Before Passing to MJExtension](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2__input_not_sanitized_or_validated_before_passing_to_mjextension.md)

* **Attack Vector Theme:** This node is the core vulnerability. Even if the application *accepts* untrusted input, the critical flaw is the *absence* of sanitization and validation *before* using MJExtension.
* **Specific Attack Vectors:**
    * **Malformed JSON/XML Payloads:** Attackers send intentionally malformed JSON/XML to trigger parsing errors or unexpected behavior in MJExtension or the application's error handling (though MJExtension is likely to handle malformed input gracefully, the application's reaction might be exploitable).
    * **Unexpected Data Types:** Injecting JSON/XML with data types that the application does not expect or handle correctly after MJExtension parsing. For example, expecting a string but receiving an array or object.
    * **Excessively Large Strings/Numbers:**  Including very large strings or numbers in JSON/XML to potentially cause buffer overflows or resource exhaustion in the application's processing of the parsed data (less likely in MJExtension itself, more likely in application code handling the output).
    * **Deeply Nested Structures:** Sending deeply nested JSON/XML structures to exhaust parsing resources or cause stack overflows in the application's processing of the parsed data.
    * **Special Characters/Control Characters:** Injecting special characters or control characters within JSON/XML strings that might be misinterpreted or mishandled by the application after MJExtension parsing, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
