# Threat Model Analysis for codermjlee/mjextension

## Threat: [Unintended Object Instantiation or Modification](./threats/unintended_object_instantiation_or_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts JSON data with keys that, intentionally or unintentionally, match properties of sensitive Objective-C objects within the application. `mjextension`'s automatic key-value mapping directly leads to the instantiation or modification of these objects with attacker-controlled data. This occurs because `mjextension` processes the JSON and uses its property mapping logic to set values on existing or newly created objects.

**Impact:** Modification of application state, potential for privilege escalation if sensitive objects are affected (e.g., user roles, permissions), data corruption.

**Affected Component:** `mj_setKeyValues:` method, property mapping logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design data models and avoid overly broad or generic property names that could easily collide with external data.
*   Consider using explicit property mapping configurations to control which JSON keys map to which object properties.
*   Implement access controls and validation on object properties *before* and *after* they are populated by `mjextension`.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within `mjextension`](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within__mjextension_.md)

**Description:** The `mjextension` library itself contains undiscovered vulnerabilities (e.g., in its parsing logic, memory management, or type conversion routines). An attacker can directly exploit these vulnerabilities by providing specially crafted JSON data that triggers the flaws within `mjextension`'s code.

**Impact:** Application crashes, arbitrary code execution (in severe cases), information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Core parsing and mapping logic within `mjextension` (specific functions would depend on the vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `mjextension` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Monitor for any reported vulnerabilities in `mjextension` through security advisories, the library's issue tracker, and security news sources.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to scan your codebase and dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.
