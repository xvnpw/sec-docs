## Attack Tree Path: [Inject JSON to bypass intended type safety mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/inject_json_to_bypass_intended_type_safety_mechanisms.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload that exploits limitations in `mjextension`'s type enforcement. This might involve providing data that can be interpreted as a different, but related, type than expected by the application.

**Likelihood:** Medium - Requires some understanding of the application's type system and `mjextension`'s mapping behavior.

**Impact:** High - Successfully bypassing type safety can allow attackers to access restricted resources or trigger unintended application logic that would normally be prevented by type checks.

**Effort:** Medium - Requires crafting specific JSON payloads tailored to the application's data model.

**Skill Level:** Intermediate - Understanding of type systems and how serialization libraries work is needed.

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium - May be detectable by monitoring object types or observing unexpected behavior in subsequent application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject JSON to set arbitrary property values](./attack_tree_paths/inject_json_to_set_arbitrary_property_values.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a JSON payload containing keys that map to critical properties within the application's objects. By setting malicious values for these properties, they can directly alter the application's state or configuration.

**Likelihood:** Medium -  Depends on how strictly the application validates or sanitizes data after deserialization.

**Impact:** High - Modifying critical application state or configuration can lead to significant security breaches, privilege escalation, or data manipulation.

**Effort:** Low -  Relatively easy to craft JSON payloads to set specific property values once the application's data model is understood.

**Skill Level:** Basic - Requires a basic understanding of JSON and the application's data structure.

**Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Depends on the application's logging and monitoring of changes to critical state variables.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject JSON to bypass property access controls (if any)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_json_to_bypass_property_access_controls__if_any_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application relies on access modifiers (like `@private` in Objective-C) for security, vulnerabilities in `mjextension`'s deserialization process could potentially allow attackers to bypass these controls and directly set values for properties that should be inaccessible.

**Likelihood:** Low -  This typically requires specific vulnerabilities within the serialization library itself or its interaction with the runtime environment.

**Impact:** Critical -  Successfully bypassing access controls allows direct access and modification of sensitive data that is intended to be protected.

**Effort:** Medium - Requires a deeper understanding of `mjextension`'s internals and potential bypass techniques.

**Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires more advanced knowledge of the library and the underlying programming language's access control mechanisms.

**Detection Difficulty:** Hard -  Difficult to detect without specific monitoring for unauthorized property access or introspection.
