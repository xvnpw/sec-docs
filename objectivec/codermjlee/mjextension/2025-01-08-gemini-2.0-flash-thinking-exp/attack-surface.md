# Attack Surface Analysis for codermjlee/mjextension

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Type Confusion/Unexpected Object Instantiation](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_type_confusionunexpected_object_instantiation.md)

* **Attack Surface: Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Type Confusion/Unexpected Object Instantiation**
    * Description: Processing JSON data from untrusted sources can lead to the creation of objects with unexpected types or states, potentially bypassing security checks or causing unexpected behavior.
    * How mjextension Contributes: `mjextension` automatically maps JSON properties to Objective-C object properties based on naming conventions and runtime type information. If the incoming JSON specifies types that are different from what the application expects, `mjextension` might still attempt to instantiate objects based on the provided JSON, leading to type confusion.
    * Example: An application expects a `User` object with a `name` (NSString) and `isAdmin` (NSNumber, boolean). A malicious JSON could provide `"isAdmin": "true"` (a string instead of a boolean). While `mjextension` might map this, the application logic expecting a boolean might behave unexpectedly, potentially granting unauthorized access if `isAdmin` is used in an authorization check.
    * Impact: Potential for privilege escalation, unauthorized access, application crashes, or unexpected state changes.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement strict input validation *before* passing data to `mjextension`. Verify the types and structure of the JSON against a predefined schema or expected object model.
        * Utilize `mj_objectClassInArray` or similar `mjextension` features to explicitly define the expected class for array elements, preventing the instantiation of unexpected object types within arrays.
        * Consider using more explicit and less automatic mapping strategies if the risk of type confusion is high.
        * Implement robust error handling to catch and manage potential type mismatches or unexpected object states after deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Potential for Indirect Code Injection via Application Logic Flaws](./attack_surfaces/potential_for_indirect_code_injection_via_application_logic_flaws.md)

* **Attack Surface: Potential for Indirect Code Injection via Application Logic Flaws**
    * Description: While `mjextension` itself doesn't execute arbitrary code, vulnerabilities in the application's code that *uses* the deserialized data could be exploited through carefully crafted JSON.
    * How mjextension Contributes: `mjextension` acts as the conduit to bring external data into the application's object model. If the application then uses this data unsafely (e.g., in constructing database queries or system commands without proper sanitization), it can lead to code injection.
    * Example: An application deserializes a `Query` object with a `filter` property from JSON. If this `filter` string is directly used in an SQL query without sanitization, a malicious actor could inject SQL code through the JSON payload.
    * Impact: Database compromise, remote code execution, data manipulation.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Apply secure coding practices when using data deserialized by `mjextension`.
        * Sanitize and validate all user-controlled data before using it in sensitive operations like database queries, system commands, or URL construction.
        * Utilize parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
        * Avoid directly executing system commands based on user-provided data.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities within the `mjextension` Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_within_the__mjextension__library_itself.md)

* **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities within the `mjextension` Library Itself**
    * Description: Like any third-party library, `mjextension` might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    * How mjextension Contributes: The application's security posture is directly tied to the security of the libraries it uses. If `mjextension` has a bug that allows for arbitrary code execution or other security issues, applications using it are vulnerable.
    * Example: A hypothetical buffer overflow vulnerability within `mjextension`'s JSON parsing logic could be triggered by a specially crafted JSON payload, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    * Impact: Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    * Risk Severity: Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Keep the `mjextension` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues related to `mjextension`.
        * Consider using dependency management tools to track and manage library updates.
        * If a critical vulnerability is discovered and an immediate update is not possible, consider implementing temporary mitigations or workarounds if feasible.
