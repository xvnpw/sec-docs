# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3.2 Bypass Blacklist/Whitelist Checks

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential vulnerabilities related to bypassing blacklist/whitelist security mechanisms implemented in applications using the `mjextension` library for JSON deserialization.  We aim to identify specific techniques attackers could employ, assess their feasibility, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to prevent attackers from instantiating arbitrary classes, which could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other severe security compromises.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on attack path 1.3.2, "Bypass blacklist/whitelist checks (if any)," within the broader attack tree concerning the `mjextension` library.  We will consider:

*   **`mjextension`'s built-in features (if any):**  Does `mjextension` itself provide any blacklist/whitelist functionality, or is this solely the responsibility of the application using the library?  We'll examine the library's source code and documentation.
*   **Common application-level implementations:** How developers typically implement blacklists/whitelists when using `mjextension`.  This includes examining common coding patterns and potential pitfalls.
*   **Specific bypass techniques:**  We will delve into the "How it works" section of the attack tree path, expanding on each technique (Class Name Obfuscation, Logic Flaws, Indirect Instantiation) with concrete examples and code snippets where possible.
*   **Interaction with other attack paths:** While the focus is on 1.3.2, we will briefly consider how successful bypass relates to the overall attack (specifically, enabling 1.3.1.1, the deserialization gadget attack).
* **Mitigation strategies:** For each identified vulnerability, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   General deserialization vulnerabilities *not* related to blacklist/whitelist bypass.
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application *not* directly related to `mjextension`'s deserialization process.
*   Attacks that do not involve JSON deserialization.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the source code of `mjextension` (available on GitHub) to understand its internal workings and identify any potential security-relevant features or weaknesses.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  We will thoroughly review the official `mjextension` documentation to understand its intended usage and any security recommendations.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will search for known vulnerabilities or exploits related to `mjextension` or similar JSON deserialization libraries in Objective-C.  This includes searching vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE), security blogs, and research papers.
4.  **Hypothetical Attack Scenario Development:**  We will construct hypothetical attack scenarios based on the "How it works" section of the attack tree path.  This will involve creating example JSON payloads and analyzing how they might be processed by `mjextension` and a hypothetical application with blacklist/whitelist checks.
5.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  We will research and document best practices for securely implementing deserialization with `mjextension`, focusing on robust blacklist/whitelist implementations.
6.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** Based on the findings, we will provide clear and actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.2

### 2.1. `mjextension`'s Built-in Features

Based on a review of the `mjextension` source code and documentation, `mjextension` itself **does not provide built-in blacklist or whitelist functionality**.  This is a crucial observation.  The library focuses on providing a convenient way to map JSON data to Objective-C objects, but it leaves security considerations like class validation entirely to the application developer.  This means any blacklist/whitelist is *application-defined*, increasing the risk of implementation errors.

### 2.2. Common Application-Level Implementations

Developers might implement blacklists/whitelists in several ways when using `mjextension`:

*   **Pre-processing JSON:**  Before passing the JSON data to `mjextension`, the application might inspect the JSON string (or parsed dictionary) and check for specific class names.  This is often done using string comparisons or regular expressions.
*   **Custom `mj_objectClassInArray` or `mj_objectClassInDictionary`:** `mjextension` provides methods like `mj_objectClassInArray` and `mj_objectClassInDictionary` to specify the class to use when deserializing objects within arrays or dictionaries.  Developers might override these methods in their model classes to perform class validation.  This is a more robust approach than pre-processing, as it's tied to the model definition.
*   **Custom Value Transformers:** `mjextension` allows for custom value transformers.  A developer could create a transformer that checks the class type before allowing the value to be set.
* **Using Key-Value Observing (KVO):** Although less common and potentially less secure, developers might try to use KVO to intercept property setting and validate the class type.

### 2.3. Specific Bypass Techniques

#### 2.3.1. Class Name Obfuscation

*   **Description:**  The attacker attempts to disguise the malicious class name to evade simple string-based checks.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Case Variation:**  If the blacklist checks for `"NSDangerousClass"`, the attacker might use `"nsdangerousclass"` or `"NSDANGEROUSCLASS"`.
    *   **Unicode Characters:**  Using visually similar Unicode characters (e.g., a Cyrillic 'а' instead of a Latin 'a').  This is particularly effective against naive string comparisons.  Example:  `"NЅDangerousClass"` (using Cyrillic 'S').
    *   **Prefixes/Suffixes:**  Adding arbitrary prefixes or suffixes (e.g., `"__NSDangerousClass__"`, `"NSDangerousClassWrapper"`).
    *   **Encoding:** URL encoding or other encoding schemes might be used if the blacklist check doesn't decode the input before comparison.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Case-Insensitive Comparisons:**  Always use case-insensitive string comparisons (e.g., `caseInsensitiveCompare:` in Objective-C).
    *   **Unicode Normalization:**  Normalize strings to a consistent Unicode form (e.g., NFC or NFD) before comparison.  This helps prevent attacks using visually similar characters.  Use `precomposedStringWithCanonicalMapping` or `decomposedStringWithCanonicalMapping` in Objective-C.
    *   **Regular Expressions (Carefully):**  Regular expressions can be used, but they must be carefully crafted to avoid unintended matches or performance issues (e.g., ReDoS).  Avoid overly broad patterns.  Prefer whitelisting with regular expressions over blacklisting.
    *   **Decode Input:**  Ensure that any encoded input (URL encoding, etc.) is decoded *before* performing blacklist/whitelist checks.

#### 2.3.2. Logic Flaws

*   **Description:**  The attacker exploits errors in the implementation of the blacklist/whitelist logic.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Incomplete Checks:**  The blacklist might only check for a few known dangerous classes, leaving others vulnerable.
    *   **String Manipulation Vulnerabilities:**  If the check uses string manipulation functions (e.g., `substringToIndex:`, `hasPrefix:`, `hasSuffix:`), it might be vulnerable to edge cases or off-by-one errors.  For example, a check for `"NSDangerousClass"` might be bypassed by `"NSDangerousClassExtra"`.
    *   **Regular Expression Errors:**  Incorrectly crafted regular expressions can lead to bypasses.  For example, a regex that's too permissive or doesn't properly handle special characters.
    *   **Type Confusion:** If the blacklist/whitelist logic relies on type checking, it might be possible to confuse it by providing unexpected data types.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Whitelist over Blacklist:**  Whenever possible, use a whitelist (allowing only known safe classes) instead of a blacklist (blocking known dangerous classes).  Whitelists are inherently more secure because they default to denying access.
    *   **Thorough Testing:**  Extensively test the blacklist/whitelist implementation with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and known attack patterns.  Use fuzzing techniques to discover unexpected vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review:**  Have multiple developers review the blacklist/whitelist code to identify potential logic flaws.
    *   **Avoid String Manipulation:**  Minimize the use of complex string manipulation functions.  Prefer direct comparisons or well-tested regular expressions.
    * **Precise Matching:** When using string comparisons, ensure you are matching the *entire* class name, not just a substring.

#### 2.3.3. Indirect Instantiation

*   **Description:**  The attacker finds a way to instantiate the forbidden class indirectly, bypassing the direct class name check.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Factory Methods:**  If the application uses factory methods to create objects, the attacker might be able to craft a JSON payload that triggers the factory method to create an instance of the forbidden class, even if the class name itself is not directly present in the JSON.
    *   **Nested Objects:**  The attacker might be able to nest the instantiation of the forbidden class within another, allowed class.  For example, if `NSAllowedClass` has a property of type `id` (or `NSObject *`), the attacker might be able to set that property to an instance of `NSDangerousClass`.
    *   **`mj_objectClassInArray` / `mj_objectClassInDictionary` Bypass:** If these methods are not implemented correctly, or if the attacker can control the keys used in a dictionary, they might be able to specify a different class than intended.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Validate Factory Method Inputs:**  If factory methods are used, carefully validate the inputs to those methods to ensure that they cannot be used to create instances of forbidden classes.
    *   **Recursive Validation:**  If nested objects are allowed, recursively validate the classes of all nested objects, not just the top-level object.
    *   **Strict Type Checking:**  Use strong typing whenever possible.  Avoid using `id` or `NSObject *` for properties that should only hold objects of specific classes.
    *   **Secure `mj_objectClassInArray` / `mj_objectClassInDictionary` Implementation:**  Implement these methods carefully and defensively.  Ensure that they cannot be bypassed by attacker-controlled input.  Consider using a whitelist within these methods.
    * **Avoid Dynamic Class Loading Based on User Input:** Do not use `NSClassFromString()` with input directly derived from the JSON payload without strict validation.

### 2.4. Interaction with Other Attack Paths

Successful bypass of the blacklist/whitelist (1.3.2) is a critical enabler for the primary deserialization gadget attack (1.3.1.1).  Without bypassing the class restrictions, the attacker cannot instantiate the malicious objects needed to trigger the gadget chain.  Therefore, preventing 1.3.2 is essential for preventing the entire attack.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

The lack of built-in blacklist/whitelist functionality in `mjextension` places a significant responsibility on application developers to implement secure deserialization.  Bypassing these checks is a crucial step in a successful deserialization attack.

**Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Prioritize Whitelisting:**  Always prefer whitelisting over blacklisting.  Define a strict list of allowed classes and reject any class not on that list.
2.  **Use `mj_objectClassInArray` and `mj_objectClassInDictionary`:** Implement these methods in your model classes to perform class validation.  This is the most robust approach.
3.  **Validate Recursively:**  If your data model allows for nested objects, recursively validate the classes of all nested objects.
4.  **Unicode Normalization and Case-Insensitive Comparisons:**  Always normalize strings and use case-insensitive comparisons when checking class names.
5.  **Thorough Testing and Code Review:**  Extensively test your blacklist/whitelist implementation and have it reviewed by multiple developers.
6.  **Avoid `NSClassFromString()` with Untrusted Input:** Do not dynamically load classes based on user-supplied data without strict validation.
7.  **Consider Alternatives:** If security is paramount, explore alternative JSON parsing libraries that offer built-in security features like class whitelisting (e.g., some libraries that support a schema-based approach).
8. **Stay Updated:** Keep `mjextension` and all other dependencies up to date to benefit from any security patches.

By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of deserialization vulnerabilities in applications using `mjextension`.
