# Threat Model Analysis for codermjlee/mjextension

## Threat: [Malformed JSON Structure Leading to Crash (DoS)](./threats/malformed_json_structure_leading_to_crash__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malformed JSON Structure Leading to Crash (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with deeply nested objects, extremely long strings, or excessively large arrays.  The attacker's goal is to cause `MJExtension` to consume excessive memory or CPU, leading to a crash or unresponsiveness of the application. This exploits `MJExtension`'s parsing algorithm. This is a form of a "billion laughs" attack adapted for JSON.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash or denial of service, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
    *   **Affected MJExtension Component:** Core parsing logic (`mj_objectWithKeyValues:`, `mj_objectArrayWithKeyValuesArray:`, and related internal methods responsible for traversing and converting the JSON structure). These are the functions *directly* responsible for handling the potentially malicious JSON.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Size Limits:** Implement strict limits on the size (in bytes) of the incoming JSON payload *before* it reaches `MJExtension`. Reject payloads exceeding this limit.
        *   **Depth Limits:** Limit the maximum nesting depth of JSON objects *before* passing to `MJExtension`. Reject payloads exceeding this limit.
        *   **Array/String Length Limits:** Limit the maximum number of elements in arrays and the maximum length of strings within the JSON *before* passing to `MJExtension`.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for `MJExtension` operations. If parsing takes longer than a predefined threshold, terminate the operation.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU and memory usage during `MJExtension` processing. If usage spikes abnormally, investigate and potentially block the request.

## Threat: [Outdated Library Version (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/outdated_library_version__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Outdated Library Version (Elevation of Privilege)

    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of `MJExtension` that contains known vulnerabilities (e.g., a buffer overflow in the parsing logic). An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities, *directly* within `MJExtension`'s code, to potentially gain control of the application or the device. This is a direct threat to the library itself.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, data breaches, complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected MJExtension Component:** The entire `MJExtension` library. Any vulnerable function within the library could be exploited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `MJExtension` updated to the latest version. Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly. This is the *primary* defense against this threat.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (e.g., CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift Package Manager) to manage `MJExtension` and other dependencies. This makes it easier to keep them updated.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including `MJExtension`.
