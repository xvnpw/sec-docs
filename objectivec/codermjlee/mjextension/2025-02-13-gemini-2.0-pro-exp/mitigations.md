# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for codermjlee/mjextension

## Mitigation Strategy: [Object Model Design and MJExtension Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/object_model_design_and_mjextension_configuration.md)

1.  **Identify Sensitive Properties:** Review each model class (e.g., `User`, `Product`, `Order`) and identify properties that should *not* be directly populated from external JSON via `MJExtension`.  These might include:
    *   Internal IDs (e.g., database primary keys).
    *   Security-related properties (e.g., password hashes, API keys).
    *   Properties that are calculated or derived from other data.
    *   Properties that control internal application state.
2.  **Use `mj_replacedKeyFromPropertyName`:**
    *   For properties that *should* be populated from JSON, but where the JSON key name differs from the property name, use `mj_replacedKeyFromPropertyName` (or the Swift equivalent) to define the mapping.  Example (Objective-C):
        ```objectivec
        + (NSDictionary *)mj_replacedKeyFromPropertyName {
            return @{
                @"userName" : @"username", // Maps JSON key "username" to property "userName"
                @"userEmail" : @"email"   // Maps JSON key "email" to property "userEmail"
            };
        }
        ```
    *   This also acts as a whitelist: only JSON keys listed in this mapping will be considered by `MJExtension`.
3.  **Use `mj_ignoredPropertyNames`:**
    *   For properties that should *never* be populated from JSON by `MJExtension`, use `mj_ignoredPropertyNames` (or the Swift equivalent) to explicitly exclude them.  Example (Objective-C):
        ```objectivec
        + (NSArray *)mj_ignoredPropertyNames {
            return @[@"internalID", @"passwordHash", @"isAdmin"];
        }
        ```
4. **Review KVC usage with MJExtension:**
    * Ensure that `MJExtension`, through its use of Key-Value Coding, is not exposing any unintended properties or methods. This requires careful review of how `MJExtension` interacts with your model objects.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Mass Assignment:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting values into unintended properties by providing extra keys in the JSON payload that `MJExtension` would otherwise process.
        *   **Over-Posting:** (Severity: High) - Similar to mass assignment, prevents attackers from setting properties they shouldn't have access to via `MJExtension`.
        *   **Data Leakage (via KVC with MJExtension):** (Severity: Medium to High) - Prevents unintended exposure of properties or methods through `MJExtension`'s use of Key-Value Coding.

    **Impact:**
        *   **Mass Assignment/Over-Posting:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%) when `mj_ignoredPropertyNames` and `mj_replacedKeyFromPropertyName` are used correctly with `MJExtension`.
        *   **Data Leakage (via KVC):** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with careful review and configuration of how `MJExtension` interacts with KVC.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `mj_replacedKeyFromPropertyName` is used in the `User` model to map a few keys.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mj_ignoredPropertyNames` is *not* used in any model class. This is a critical missing piece for preventing mass assignment via `MJExtension`.
        *   `mj_replacedKeyFromPropertyName` is not consistently used across all models; some models rely on direct key-to-property mapping, which is less secure with `MJExtension`.
        *   A comprehensive review of KVC usage with `MJExtension` hasn't been performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Handling of Nested Objects and Collections with MJExtension](./mitigation_strategies/handling_of_nested_objects_and_collections_with_mjextension.md)

1.  **Identify Nested Structures:** Identify any model properties that represent nested objects or arrays of objects that `MJExtension` will process.
2.  **Use `mj_objectClassInArray`:**
    *   For properties that represent arrays of objects, and are processed by `MJExtension`, use `mj_objectClassInArray` (or the Swift equivalent) to specify the expected class of the objects within the array.  Example (Objective-C):
        ```objectivec
        + (NSDictionary *)mj_objectClassInArray {
            return @{
                @"orders" : @"Order" // Specifies that the "orders" array contains "Order" objects
            };
        }
        ```
    *   This provides type safety within `MJExtension` and helps prevent injection of unexpected object types.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Type Confusion in Collections (within MJExtension):** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures that arrays processed by `MJExtension` contain objects of the expected type, preventing logic errors or crashes that could arise from `MJExtension` passing incorrect types to your code.

    **Impact:**
        *   **Type Confusion in Collections:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%) with `mj_objectClassInArray` used correctly with `MJExtension`.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `mj_objectClassInArray` is used in a few places.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `mj_objectClassInArray` is not consistently used across all models with array properties that are handled by `MJExtension`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates of MJExtension](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_of_mjextension.md)

1.  **Use a Dependency Manager:** Use a dependency management tool (CocoaPods for Objective-C, Swift Package Manager for Swift) to manage the `MJExtension` library.
2.  **Regularly Update:**
    *   Configure your dependency manager to check for updates regularly (e.g., daily or weekly).
    *   Use commands like `pod update` (CocoaPods) or `swift package update` (Swift Package Manager) to update to the latest versions of `MJExtension`.
    *   Test your application thoroughly after updating `MJExtension` to ensure that no regressions have been introduced.
3.  **Monitor Security Advisories:**
    *   Subscribe to security advisories or mailing lists related to Objective-C/Swift development and common libraries.
    *   Monitor the GitHub repository for `MJExtension` for any reported security issues.
    *   If a vulnerability is discovered in `MJExtension`, update to a patched version as soon as possible.

    **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `MJExtension`:** (Severity: Variable, depends on the vulnerability) - Protects against any security flaws that may be discovered and fixed in the `MJExtension` library itself.

    **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (dependent on timely updates). The faster you update `MJExtension`, the lower the risk.

    **Currently Implemented:**
        *   CocoaPods is used to manage dependencies, including `MJExtension`.

    **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Regular, automated updates of `MJExtension` are not configured. Updates are performed manually and infrequently.
        *   There is no active monitoring of security advisories specifically for `MJExtension`.
