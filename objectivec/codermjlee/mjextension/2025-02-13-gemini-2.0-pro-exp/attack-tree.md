## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Deserialization Gadgets [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_deserialization_gadgets__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most dangerous attack vector. It leverages the inherent risks of deserializing data from untrusted sources. If `mjextension` uses `NSCoding`, `NSKeyedUnarchiver`, or any other mechanism that allows the instantiation of arbitrary objects based on the input data, it becomes vulnerable to "gadget chain" attacks.
    *   **How it works:**
        1.  The attacker crafts a malicious JSON or Plist payload. This payload doesn't directly contain malicious code. Instead, it describes a series of objects and their properties.
        2.  When `mjextension` deserializes this payload, it creates the specified objects.
        3.  The attacker carefully chooses the object types and property values so that the *process of object creation and property setting* triggers a chain of method calls.
        4.  This chain of calls, known as a "gadget chain," ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary code. This often involves exploiting existing methods within the application or its dependencies that have unintended side effects when called in a specific sequence.
        5. Common gadgets include methods that perform file operations, execute system commands, or load dynamic libraries.
    *   **Why it's high risk:**
        *   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), giving the attacker complete control over the application.
        *   **Medium to High Likelihood:** If `NSCoding` or similar is used, the attack surface is significant. Finding gadget chains can be challenging, but numerous tools and techniques exist to aid attackers.
        *   **Difficult to Prevent:** Completely preventing deserialization vulnerabilities is extremely difficult without fundamentally changing the way data is handled.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 If mjextension uses `NSCoding` or similar, look for "gadget chains." [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_if_mjextension_uses__nscoding__or_similar__look_for_gadget_chains___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the critical condition that enables the high-risk attack. The use of `NSCoding` (or an equivalent mechanism) is the *fundamental vulnerability*.
    *   **Why it's critical:** Without this, the attacker cannot instantiate arbitrary objects based on the input data, making gadget chain attacks impossible. This node's presence or absence determines whether the entire high-risk path is viable.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.1 Craft a malicious JSON/Plist that, when deserialized, triggers a chain of method calls leading to arbitrary code execution. [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_1_craft_a_malicious_jsonplist_that__when_deserialized__triggers_a_chain_of_method_calls_leadin_815a10b6.md)

*   **Description:** This is the specific action the attacker takes to exploit the vulnerability. It involves crafting the malicious payload that triggers the gadget chain.
    *   **Detailed Steps:**
        1.  **Identify Gadget Chains:** The attacker analyzes the application's code and its dependencies (including `mjextension` and any libraries it uses) to find sequences of method calls that can be chained together to achieve a malicious outcome. This often involves using automated tools and public databases of known gadget chains.
        2.  **Craft the Payload:** The attacker constructs a JSON or Plist payload that, when deserialized, will create the objects and set the properties necessary to trigger the identified gadget chain. This requires a deep understanding of how `mjextension` maps JSON/Plist data to Objective-C objects.
        3.  **Deliver the Payload:** The attacker delivers the malicious payload to the application through any input vector that is processed by `mjextension`. This could be a network request, a file upload, or any other means of providing data to the application.
    *   **Why it's high risk and critical:** This is the direct path to RCE. If the attacker succeeds at this step, they have achieved their goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Bypass blacklist/whitelist checks (if any)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_bypass_blacklistwhitelist_checks__if_any_.md)

* **Description:** If `mjextension` or the application using it implements any form of class blacklisting (preventing certain classes from being deserialized) or whitelisting (allowing only specific classes), the attacker will attempt to bypass these checks.
    * **How it works:**
        * **Class Name Obfuscation:** The attacker might try variations of class names, using different capitalization, adding prefixes or suffixes, or using Unicode characters to try to trick the filtering mechanism.
        * **Logic Flaws:** The attacker might look for flaws in the implementation of the blacklist/whitelist. For example, if the check is performed using string comparisons, it might be vulnerable to case-sensitivity issues or other string manipulation tricks.
        * **Indirect Instantiation:** The attacker might try to find ways to indirectly instantiate a forbidden class, perhaps through a factory method or another mechanism that is not directly subject to the blacklist/whitelist check.
    * **Why it is important:** Successful bypass of these checks allows the attacker to proceed with the primary deserialization gadget attack (1.3.1.1), even if the application attempts to restrict the classes that can be instantiated.
