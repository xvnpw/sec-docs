# Attack Surface Analysis for codermjlee/mjextension

## Attack Surface: [Malicious JSON Payloads Leading to Unexpected Object State](./attack_surfaces/malicious_json_payloads_leading_to_unexpected_object_state.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft malicious JSON payloads that, when processed by `mjextension`, manipulate the state of application objects in unintended ways. This can bypass security checks, alter application logic, or lead to data corruption.

**How mjextension Contributes:** `mjextension` automatically maps JSON keys to object properties. If the application doesn't perform sufficient validation *after* the mapping, attackers can set internal variables or properties that should not be directly influenced by external input.

**Example:** A JSON payload sets an `isAdmin` property to `true` on a user object, bypassing authentication checks after `mjextension` populates the object.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access, data manipulation, application malfunction.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Post-Mapping Validation:** Implement strict validation rules on the properties of objects *after* they have been populated by `mjextension`. Do not rely solely on the mapping process for security.
* **Immutable Objects:** Where feasible, design critical objects to be immutable or have limited setters to prevent unintended modifications.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only map necessary JSON data to object properties. Avoid blindly mapping all incoming data.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Attackers send specially crafted JSON payloads that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during the `mjextension` parsing and mapping process, leading to application slowdown or crashes.

**How mjextension Contributes:** `mjextension` needs to process the entire JSON structure. Deeply nested or extremely large JSON payloads can strain the parsing and object creation mechanisms.

**Example:** Sending a JSON payload with thousands of nested objects or a very large array, causing the application to run out of memory or become unresponsive while `mjextension` attempts to process it.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Payload Size Limits:** Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming JSON payloads.
* **Timeout Mechanisms:** Set timeouts for JSON parsing and mapping operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
* **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests from a single source to prevent attackers from overwhelming the application with malicious payloads.
