# Threat Model Analysis for codermjlee/mjextension

## Threat: [Type Confusion leading to unexpected behavior or crashes](./threats/type_confusion_leading_to_unexpected_behavior_or_crashes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides JSON data where the types of values do not match the expected types of the corresponding Objective-C/Swift properties. `mjextension` attempts to map these values, potentially leading to runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or application crashes due to incorrect type assignments within the application's objects managed by `mjextension`. The attacker might manipulate API responses or local data files to inject such malformed data that `mjextension` processes.
*   **Impact:** Application instability, potential data corruption if incorrect values are used in further processing due to `mjextension`'s flawed mapping, and possible denial of service if the application crashes frequently after `mjextension` processes malicious input.
*   **Affected Component:** Data mapping logic within `mjextension`, specifically the functions responsible for converting JSON values to object properties (e.g., within the `mj_setKeyValues:` family of methods).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation *before* passing data to `mjextension`. Verify data types and formats against expected schemas.
    *   Utilize `mj_objectClassInArray` to explicitly define the expected class for elements within arrays to guide `mjextension`'s mapping.
    *   Leverage Swift's strong typing and optional types to handle potential nil values or type mismatches gracefully *after* `mjextension` processing.
    *   Implement comprehensive unit tests that specifically target scenarios with invalid or unexpected data types being processed by `mjextension`.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Over-Serialization](./threats/information_disclosure_through_over-serialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to serialized data (e.g., through API responses or local storage) that inadvertently includes sensitive information because `mjextension`'s serialization methods include properties that should be kept private. Developers might not have explicitly configured `mjextension` to exclude these properties during the object-to-JSON conversion.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, such as user credentials, personal information, or internal application details, potentially leading to further attacks or privacy breaches due to the unintended serialization performed by `mjextension`.
*   **Affected Component:** Serialization methods within `mjextension`, specifically the functions responsible for converting objects back to JSON (e.g., methods related to `mj_JSONString`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Explicitly define which properties should be ignored during serialization using `mj_ignoredPropertyNames` within your model classes when using `mjextension`.
    *   Carefully review the properties of your model objects and ensure that sensitive data is not included in objects that are routinely serialized using `mjextension`.
    *   Consider using separate data transfer objects (DTOs) for API responses to control the data being exposed through `mjextension`'s serialization.
