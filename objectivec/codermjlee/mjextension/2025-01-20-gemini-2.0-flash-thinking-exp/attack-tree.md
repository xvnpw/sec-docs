## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Input Handling -> Inject Malicious JSON Payloads -> Inject Code via Custom Model Properties -> Exploit Unsafe KVC (Key-Value Coding) Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_input_handling_-_inject_malicious_json_payloads_-_inject_code_via_custom_model_pro_b61d0946.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting unsafe usage of Key-Value Coding (KVC) during the setting of custom model properties based on deserialized JSON.
* Critical Node: Exploit Unsafe KVC (Key-Value Coding) Usage
    * Description: If the application uses KVC to set properties based on JSON data without proper sanitization, an attacker can craft malicious JSON payloads where the keys correspond to KVC "key paths" that can trigger unintended method calls or code execution. For example, setting a property with a value like `@constructor/Runtime.getRuntime()/exec` could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    * Risk: High - This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Input Handling -> Inject Malicious JSON Payloads -> Inject Data to Overwrite Sensitive Information -> Target Mapped Properties with Critical Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_input_handling_-_inject_malicious_json_payloads_-_inject_data_to_overwrite_sensiti_7163cd8c.md)

* Attack Vector: Injecting malicious data into JSON payloads to overwrite sensitive information by targeting mapped properties.
* Critical Node: Target Mapped Properties with Critical Data
    * Description: By understanding how `mjextension` maps JSON keys to object properties, an attacker can craft JSON payloads to overwrite sensitive data stored in the application's models. This could include user credentials, API keys, configuration settings, or other critical information.
    * Risk: High - This can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, and compromise of sensitive functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses -> Abuse Custom Property Mapping -> Map External Input Directly to Sensitive Internal Properties](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses_-_abuse_custom_property_mapping_-_map_external_input_directly_to_se_8f221bf3.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting insecure custom property mapping where external input from JSON is directly mapped to sensitive internal properties without proper validation.
* Critical Node: Map External Input Directly to Sensitive Internal Properties
    * Description: If the application directly maps JSON keys from external sources to internal properties that control sensitive functionalities or store critical data, an attacker can manipulate the JSON input to directly modify these properties. This bypasses any intended validation or security checks.
    * Risk: High - This can grant attackers direct access to sensitive data, allow them to modify application behavior, or even escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using mjextension [Entry Point for Data Manipulation]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_mjextension__entry_point_for_data_manipulation_.md)

* Description: This represents the overall goal of the attacker and the entry point for all potential attacks leveraging vulnerabilities in the application's use of `mjextension`.
    * Risk: High - Successful compromise can lead to a wide range of negative consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Input Handling [Untrusted Data Processing]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_input_handling__untrusted_data_processing_.md)

* Description: This node highlights the inherent risk of processing untrusted data from external sources. If this stage is not secured, it opens the door for various injection attacks.
    * Risk: High - Failure to properly handle malicious input is a primary cause of many security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JSON Payloads [Payload Injection Point]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_json_payloads__payload_injection_point_.md)

* Description: This is the specific point where the attacker attempts to insert malicious data into the JSON structure being processed by `mjextension`.
    * Risk: High - Successful injection can lead to code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsafe KVC (Key-Value Coding) Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsafe_kvc__key-value_coding__usage.md)

* Description: This critical node represents a specific coding practice that, if not implemented carefully, can lead to Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities.
    * Risk: High - RCE is one of the most severe security risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Mapped Properties with Critical Data](./attack_tree_paths/target_mapped_properties_with_critical_data.md)

* Description: This node highlights the vulnerability of directly mapping external input to properties containing sensitive information without proper validation.
    * Risk: High - Can lead to significant data breaches and compromise of sensitive functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses [Misconfiguration Vulnerability]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses__misconfiguration_vulnerability_.md)

* Description: This node emphasizes the risks associated with insecure configurations, particularly in how property mapping and custom transformations are handled.
    * Risk: High - Misconfigurations can unintentionally expose sensitive data or create pathways for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Map External Input Directly to Sensitive Internal Properties](./attack_tree_paths/map_external_input_directly_to_sensitive_internal_properties.md)

* Description: This specific configuration weakness is a critical point of failure, allowing attackers to directly manipulate sensitive application state.
    * Risk: High - Can lead to direct access to sensitive data and critical functionalities.
