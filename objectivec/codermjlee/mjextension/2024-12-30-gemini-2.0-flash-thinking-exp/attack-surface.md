Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve MJExtension, with high and critical severity:

* **Deserialization of Malicious JSON Payloads**
    * **Description:** The application processes untrusted JSON data using MJExtension. Maliciously crafted JSON can exploit vulnerabilities in MJExtension's deserialization process.
    * **How MJExtension Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MJExtension's core functionality of converting JSON into Objective-C objects makes it the direct handler of the potentially malicious input. Unexpected structures or excessive nesting in the JSON can directly impact MJExtension's parsing logic.
    * **Example:** A JSON payload with extremely deep nesting is passed to `mj_objectWithKeyValues:`. MJExtension attempts to parse this deeply nested structure, leading to excessive memory consumption and a potential Denial of Service.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially leading to application crashes or unresponsiveness.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation *Before* MJExtension:** Implement strict validation of the incoming JSON structure and data types *before* passing it to MJExtension. Define expected schemas and reject payloads that don't conform.
        * **Resource Limits:** Implement timeouts and limits on the size and complexity of JSON payloads processed by the application, preventing excessively large or nested JSON from reaching MJExtension.
        * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around MJExtension's deserialization methods to gracefully handle parsing failures and prevent crashes.

* **Exploiting Custom Property Mappings**
    * **Description:** Developers use MJExtension's features to map JSON keys to different Objective-C property names. Incorrect or insecure mapping logic can be exploited by crafting specific JSON payloads.
    * **How MJExtension Contributes to the Attack Surface:** MJExtension provides the direct mechanism for defining and applying these custom mappings. Vulnerabilities arise from how these mappings are configured within MJExtension.
    * **Example:** A custom mapping incorrectly associates a user-provided "role" field in the JSON with an internal `isAdmin` property in the Objective-C model. An attacker could send JSON with `"role": true` to gain administrative privileges after deserialization by MJExtension.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data modification, security bypasses.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Mapping Design:** Thoroughly review and test all custom property mappings to ensure they behave as expected and do not introduce vulnerabilities. Follow the principle of least privilege when mapping external data to internal properties.
        * **Avoid Direct Mapping of Untrusted Input to Sensitive Properties:**  Do not directly map user-controlled JSON values to sensitive internal properties. Use intermediate steps and validation.
        * **Regular Security Reviews:** Conduct security reviews of the code that defines and uses custom property mappings to identify potential flaws.
