# Attack Surface Analysis for codermjlee/mjrefresh

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Refresh/Load Callbacks for Malicious Actions](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_refreshload_callbacks_for_malicious_actions.md)

* **Description:** The application uses callbacks provided by `mjrefresh` to perform actions after a refresh or load is completed. Attackers might try to intercept or manipulate these callbacks to execute unintended code.
    * **How mjrefresh Contributes:** `mjrefresh` uses block-based callbacks (e.g., `setRefreshingCompletionBlock:`) to notify the application when refresh/load operations are done. If the application doesn't properly secure the execution context of these blocks or if the logic within the blocks is vulnerable, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker might find a way to overwrite the `refreshingCompletionBlock` with a malicious block that executes unintended code or leaks sensitive information.
    * **Impact:**  Code execution, data exfiltration, unauthorized actions within the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Callback Handling:** Ensure that the code within the completion blocks is secure and doesn't perform actions based on untrusted input.
        * **Avoid Global Storage of Callbacks:** Minimize the storage of callback blocks in globally accessible locations where they could be overwritten.
        * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of the sections where `mjrefresh` callbacks are implemented and handled.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data in Refresh/Load](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_data_in_refreshload.md)

* **Description:** The data fetched during a refresh or load-more operation is not properly sanitized by the application before being displayed in views managed by `mjrefresh`, leading to client-side XSS.
    * **How mjrefresh Contributes:** `mjrefresh` facilitates the display of updated content after a refresh or load. If the application directly binds unsanitized data to UI elements within the refreshed views (e.g., `UITableViewCell` content) that are managed and updated by `mjrefresh`, it creates an opportunity for XSS.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor could inject JavaScript code into data on the backend. When this data is fetched during a refresh and displayed by the application using views managed by `mjrefresh`, the script could execute in the user's context.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application UI.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all data received from the backend before displaying it in any UI elements managed or updated by `mjrefresh`. Use appropriate encoding techniques for the target view (e.g., HTML escaping for web views).
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and enforce a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
        * **Secure Data Binding Practices:** Avoid directly binding raw, untrusted data to UI elements managed by `mjrefresh`.
