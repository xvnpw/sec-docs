# Threat Model Analysis for codermjlee/mjrefresh

## Threat: [Server-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Refresh Requests (Triggered by `MJRefresh` Event Handling)](./threats/server-side_denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_refresh_requests__triggered_by__mjrefresh__event_h_1dabdee2.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker repeatedly triggers the pull-to-refresh or infinite scrolling functionality, sending a flood of data requests to the application's server. While the attacker interacts with the *application's* UI, the rapid triggering of `MJRefresh`'s event handlers is the *mechanism* that enables the attack. The attacker does *not* need to modify `MJRefresh`'s code.
    *   **Impact:** The server becomes overwhelmed, unable to respond to legitimate user requests, leading to service unavailability. Potential increased server costs.
    *   **MJRefresh Component Affected:** The event handling mechanism within `MJRefresh` that triggers network requests. Specifically, the methods/blocks associated with `beginRefreshing` (for pull-to-refresh) and the logic that triggers loading more data in infinite scrolling (often tied to `scrollViewDidScroll` or similar delegate methods used *in conjunction with* `MJRefresh`). The lack of built-in rate limiting or throttling within these event handlers is the direct issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Rate Limiting:** Implement robust rate limiting on the *server* to restrict requests from a single IP address or user. This is the *primary* mitigation, as it addresses the root cause.
        *   **Client-Side Throttling (within `MJRefresh` usage):** Add a cooldown period after `beginRefreshing` is called. Prevent it from being called again until the cooldown expires. This is done in the *application code* that uses `MJRefresh`, not within `MJRefresh` itself.
        *   **Debouncing (for Infinite Scrolling, within `MJRefresh` usage):** For infinite scrolling, debounce the "load more data" logic to prevent multiple calls. This is also implemented in the *application code*.

## Threat: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Refresh Requests (Triggered by `MJRefresh` Event Handling)](./threats/client-side_denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_refresh_requests__triggered_by__mjrefresh__event_h_cc705ef9.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to server-side DoS, but the attacker's actions primarily impact the client device. Repeated, rapid refresh requests, facilitated by `MJRefresh`'s event handling, consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, battery), making the application unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unusable on the attacker's device. User experience is severely degraded.
    *   **MJRefresh Component Affected:** The event handling mechanism within `MJRefresh` that triggers network requests and UI updates. The methods/blocks associated with `beginRefreshing` and the infinite scrolling logic are the points of interaction. The lack of built-in safeguards against rapid, repeated triggering is the direct issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Client-Side Throttling (within `MJRefresh` usage):** Implement a cooldown period to prevent rapid, repeated refresh requests. This is done in the *application code* using `MJRefresh`.
        *   **Debouncing (for Infinite Scrolling, within `MJRefresh` usage):** Prevent multiple "load more data" calls. Implemented in the *application code*.
        *   **Optimize Data Handling (in application code):** Ensure efficient data handling and avoid unnecessary UI updates. Use background threads for data processing. This is *application-level* mitigation, not within `MJRefresh`.
        * **Limit Concurrent Network Requests (in application code):** Avoid multiple simultaneous network requests.
