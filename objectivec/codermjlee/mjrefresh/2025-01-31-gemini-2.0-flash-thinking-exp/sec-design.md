# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance user experience in mobile applications by providing smooth and intuitive pull-to-refresh functionality.
  - Improve user engagement and satisfaction by allowing users to easily refresh content.
  - Provide a reusable and customizable component for iOS developers to accelerate application development.
  - Maintain a high-quality, stable, and performant library to build trust and encourage adoption.

- Business Risks:
  - Poor user experience due to bugs or performance issues in the refresh control.
  - Negative impact on application stability if the library introduces crashes or memory leaks.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications that use it, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
  - Lack of adoption or developer dissatisfaction if the library is difficult to use, poorly documented, or lacks necessary features.
  - Dependency on a single maintainer or lack of community support could lead to project stagnation or abandonment.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Open-source project, allowing community review and contributions. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on external contributors for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced during development and not immediately detected.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Introduce dependency scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used during development or build process.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from external developers.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a client-side library.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a client-side library.
  - Input Validation: The library should handle various input conditions gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to invalid input from the application using it. Validate any configuration options or parameters provided by the integrating application.
  - Cryptography:  Likely not directly required for a UI library like this. If any data persistence or transmission is introduced in future versions, appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered. For now, no specific cryptography requirements.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a reliable and user-friendly pull-to-refresh experience in mobile applications.
  - Maintaining developer trust and encouraging adoption of the mjrefresh library.
  - Ensuring the stability and performance of applications that integrate the library.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the mjrefresh library (Medium Sensitivity - Intellectual Property).
  - No direct handling of user data by the library itself. However, applications using the library may handle sensitive user data. The library should not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise this data. (High Sensitivity - Indirectly related to user data via integrating applications).
  - Build and release pipeline integrity (Medium Sensitivity - Operational Security).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended scope of security testing for the library? (e.g., focus on memory safety, input validation, or broader security concerns?)
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements or industry standards that the library needs to adhere to?
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports from the community?
  - Is there a dedicated security team or individual responsible for overseeing the security of the mjrefresh library project?

- Assumptions:
  - The primary goal of the mjrefresh library is to enhance user experience in iOS applications.
  - Security is a secondary but important consideration for the project.
  - The library is intended to be used by a wide range of iOS application developers, potentially including those working on applications that handle sensitive user data.
  - The project is open to community contributions and feedback, including security-related input.
  - The build and release process is currently manual or semi-automated and can be improved with more robust security controls.
