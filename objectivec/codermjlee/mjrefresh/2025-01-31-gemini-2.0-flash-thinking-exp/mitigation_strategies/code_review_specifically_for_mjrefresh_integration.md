*   **Subjectivity and Consistency:**  The effectiveness of code reviews can be subjective and vary depending on the reviewers involved. Ensuring consistency in review quality can be difficult.
*   **Limited Scope:** Code reviews primarily focus on static code analysis and may not effectively identify runtime vulnerabilities or issues related to system configuration or external dependencies.
*   **Not Automated:**  Code reviews are a manual process and do not provide continuous or automated security checks. They are typically performed at specific points in the development cycle.
*   **Potential for "Rubber Stamping":** If not properly managed, code reviews can become a formality ("rubber stamping") without genuinely thorough analysis, reducing their effectiveness.
*   **May Miss Subtle Logic Flaws:** While good for catching obvious errors, very subtle or complex logic flaws, especially those related to timing or race conditions in refresh logic, might be overlooked even in code reviews.

#### 4.4. Implementation Challenges

*   **Defining Clear Guidelines and Checklists:** Creating specific and actionable guidelines and checklists for reviewers to focus on security aspects of `mjrefresh` integration is crucial but requires effort and expertise.
*   **Developer Training:**  Developers need to be trained on secure coding practices related to refresh functionality and how to effectively review code for security vulnerabilities in this context. This training requires time and resources.
*   **Integrating into Existing Workflow:** Seamlessly integrating focused `mjrefresh` code reviews into existing development workflows without causing significant delays or friction requires careful planning and communication.
