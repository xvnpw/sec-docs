# Attack Surface Analysis for codermjlee/mjrefresh

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Refresh/Load More Requests](./attack_surfaces/excessive_refreshload_more_requests.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates the UI or uses automated tools to trigger an overwhelming number of refresh or load more requests, directly leveraging `mjrefresh`'s functionality.
    * **How mjrefresh Contributes:** `mjrefresh` provides the UI elements and the underlying event handling that triggers these requests based on user interaction (or simulated interaction). Its core purpose is to enable this functionality, making it a direct component of this attack vector.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses a script to repeatedly simulate pull-to-refresh gestures on a mobile device or within a browser, exploiting `mjrefresh`'s event listeners to flood the server with requests.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on the server, resource exhaustion (bandwidth, database load), increased costs for cloud-based services, and degraded user experience for legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Client-Side Throttling/Debouncing within `mjrefresh` Usage:** Implement or configure throttling or debouncing mechanisms in how the application uses `mjrefresh` to limit the frequency of requests initiated by user actions.
        * **Server-Side Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on the server for refresh/load more endpoints, based on IP address, user session, or other relevant identifiers. This complements client-side measures.
