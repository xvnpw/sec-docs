**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design overview of the `mjrefresh` project, a library intended to implement secure refresh token rotation for web applications. This document will serve as the foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture, data flow, and potential vulnerabilities.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of the `mjrefresh` project are to:

* Provide a secure and robust mechanism for refreshing access tokens, minimizing the need for frequent user re-authentication.
* Implement refresh token rotation as a security best practice to limit the lifespan and potential misuse of refresh tokens.
* Offer a flexible and configurable solution adaptable to various web application architectures and authentication schemes.
* Provide clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation and code examples for developers.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The `mjrefresh` library is designed to be integrated as a middleware component within an existing authentication and authorization framework. It interacts with the following key entities:

* **Client Application:** The application (e.g., a web browser, mobile app, or other service) that requires access to protected resources.
* **API Gateway/Backend Service:** The service acting as a central point of entry, responsible for authenticating incoming requests and authorizing access to backend resources. This is the primary integration point for `mjrefresh`.
* **Authorization Server:** The dedicated service responsible for authenticating users and issuing initial access tokens and refresh tokens. While `mjrefresh` doesn't implement the authorization server itself, it relies on its functionality.
* **Data Store:** A persistent storage mechanism used to securely store and manage refresh tokens along with their associated metadata.

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1. Components

* **Refresh Token Generation:**
    * Responsible for creating new, cryptographically secure refresh tokens.
    * Involves generating a unique identifier (e.g., UUID) and setting an expiration timestamp.
    * Integrates with a cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure unpredictability.
    * May include embedding metadata within the token (if using a structured format like JWT, though best practice is to store metadata separately).
* **Refresh Token Storage:**
    * Manages the persistent storage of refresh tokens and associated metadata.
    * Stores critical information such as:
        * `UserID`:  The identifier of the user associated with the token.
        * `TokenID`: A unique identifier for the refresh token itself.
        * `ExpirationTimestamp`: The time after which the token is no longer valid.
        * `Scopes` (Optional):  The authorization scopes granted by the token.
        * `Status`: The current state of the token (e.g., `active`, `rotated`, `revoked`).
        * `CreatedAt`:  Timestamp of token creation.
        * `RotatedAt` (Optional): Timestamp of the last rotation.
        * `PreviousTokenID` (Optional):  Reference to the previously used refresh token in a rotation chain.
    * Supports configurable storage options, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and potentially in-memory caches for specific use cases (with careful consideration of persistence).
* **Refresh Token Validation:**
    * Verifies the authenticity and validity of a presented refresh token.
    * Performs the following checks:
        * **Existence:** Ensures the token exists in the data store.
        * **Expiration:** Verifies that the current time is before the `ExpirationTimestamp`.
        * **Status:** Confirms the token's `Status` is `active`.
        * **Revocation Check:** Ensures the token has not been explicitly revoked.
        * **Optionally, checks for rotation:** If rotation is enforced, verifies if the token is the latest valid token in the rotation chain.
* **Refresh Token Rotation Logic:**
    * Implements the core mechanism for securely rotating refresh tokens.
    * Upon successful validation of a refresh token:
        * Generates a new refresh token with a new `TokenID` and potentially a new `ExpirationTimestamp`.
        * Generates a new access token (typically by interacting with the Authorization Server or using pre-configured credentials).
        * Updates the data store:
            * Stores the new refresh token with its associated metadata.
            * Marks the old refresh token as `rotated` or `invalid`.
            * Optionally links the new token to the old one (e.g., through `PreviousTokenID`).
        * Returns the new access token and the new refresh token to the client.
* **Configuration:**
    * Provides options to customize the library's behavior, including:
        * `RefreshTokenExpiration`: The duration for which a refresh token is valid.
        * `StorageMechanism`: The chosen method for storing refresh tokens.
        * `TokenLength`: The length of generated refresh tokens.
        * `RotationEnabled`: A flag to enable or disable refresh token rotation.
        * `SingleUseTokens`:  Option to enforce that a refresh token can only be used once.
        * `DataStoreConfiguration`:  Settings specific to the chosen data store.

### 4.2. Data Flow for Token Refresh

1. The client application attempts to access a protected resource using an expired access token, resulting in an authentication error.
2. The client application sends a request to the API Gateway/Backend Service, including the expired access token and the refresh token.
3. The API Gateway/Backend Service intercepts the request and invokes the `mjrefresh` library's refresh token handling logic.
4. The `mjrefresh` library retrieves the refresh token data from the configured data store using the presented refresh token.
5. The library performs validation checks on the retrieved refresh token (existence, expiration, status, revocation, rotation).
6. If the refresh token is valid:
    * The `mjrefresh` library's rotation logic generates a new access token (potentially by interacting with the Authorization Server with client credentials or a pre-configured grant).
    * A new refresh token is generated.
    * The new refresh token is stored in the data store, and the status of the old refresh token is updated (e.g., marked as `rotated`).
    * The new access token and the new refresh token are returned to the API Gateway/Backend Service.
7. The API Gateway/Backend Service sends the new access token and the new refresh token back to the client application.
8. The client application replaces the old tokens with the new ones and can now access protected resources using the new access token.

### 4.3. Technologies Used (Inferred from Common Practices)

* **Programming Language:** Likely JavaScript/TypeScript, aligning with the repository name and typical web development contexts.
* **Potential Dependencies:**
    * **Cryptographic Libraries:** For secure token generation and potentially signing (e.g., `crypto`, `node-jose`).
    * **Database Client Libraries:**  Depending on the supported storage mechanisms (e.g., `pg` for PostgreSQL, `mysql2` for MySQL, `mongoose` for MongoDB, database-specific drivers).
    * **UUID Generation Libraries:** For creating unique token identifiers (e.g., `uuid`).
    * **Date/Time Manipulation Libraries:** For handling token expiration and timestamps.

## 5. Security Considerations (Pre-Threat Modeling)

Identifying potential security concerns based on the design is crucial for effective threat modeling:

* **Refresh Token Storage Compromise:**
    * Risk: If the data store is compromised, attackers could gain access to refresh tokens and potentially impersonate users.
    * Mitigation: Employ strong encryption at rest for the data store, implement robust access controls, and regularly audit security configurations.
* **Refresh Token Transmission Interception:**
    * Risk: If refresh tokens are transmitted over insecure channels (without HTTPS), they could be intercepted by attackers.
    * Mitigation: Enforce HTTPS for all communication involving refresh tokens. Consider using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
* **Refresh Token Lifetime Exploitation:**
    * Risk: Long-lived refresh tokens increase the window of opportunity for attackers if a token is compromised.
    * Mitigation: Implement appropriate refresh token expiration times, balancing security with usability. Implement refresh token rotation to mitigate the risk of long-lived tokens.
* **Flaws in Refresh Token Rotation Logic:**
    * Risk: Vulnerabilities in the rotation mechanism could allow attackers to reuse refresh tokens or obtain multiple access tokens.
    * Mitigation: Implement the rotation logic carefully, ensuring that old tokens are invalidated correctly and new tokens are securely generated and associated.
* **Lack of Refresh Token Revocation:**
    * Risk: If there's no mechanism to revoke refresh tokens, compromised tokens can be used indefinitely until they expire naturally.
    * Mitigation: Implement a robust refresh token revocation mechanism, triggered by events like user logout, password changes, or suspected security breaches.
* **Client-Side Vulnerabilities (XSS):**
    * Risk: If the client application is vulnerable to XSS, attackers could steal refresh tokens stored in the browser.
    * Mitigation: Implement strong client-side security measures to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., input validation, output encoding, Content Security Policy).
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on Refresh Endpoint:**
    * Risk: Attackers could trick users into making unauthorized refresh requests.
    * Mitigation: Implement CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., synchronizer tokens, SameSite cookies) for the refresh token endpoint.
* **Database Injection Attacks:**
    * Risk: If the data store interaction is not properly secured, attackers could inject malicious code to access or manipulate refresh token data.
    * Mitigation: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and similar database injection attacks.
* **Insecure Secret Key Management (if tokens are signed):**
    * Risk: If secret keys used for signing refresh tokens are compromised, attackers could forge valid tokens.
    * Mitigation: Store secret keys securely (e.g., using hardware security modules or secure vault solutions) and implement proper key rotation procedures.
* **Refresh Token Replay Attacks:**
    * Risk: Attackers could attempt to reuse a refresh token multiple times to obtain multiple access tokens.
    * Mitigation: Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent replay attacks, such as tracking token usage or using single-use tokens.

## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

* **Secure Communication Channels:** It is assumed that all communication involving refresh tokens (between the client and the API Gateway, and between the API Gateway and the Authorization Server/Data Store) occurs over HTTPS.
* **Secure Key Management Practices:** It is assumed that any cryptographic keys used for signing or encrypting tokens are managed securely, following industry best practices.
* **Reliable and Secure Data Store:** The data store used for storing refresh tokens is assumed to be reliable, available, and secured against unauthorized access and data breaches.
* **Integration within Existing Framework:** The `mjrefresh` library is designed to be integrated into an existing authentication and authorization framework and relies on its core functionalities.

## 7. Future Considerations

* **Token Binding for Enhanced Security:** Explore the implementation of token binding techniques to cryptographically link refresh tokens to specific devices or client applications, further mitigating the risk of token theft.
* **JTI (JWT ID) Tracking for Refresh Tokens:** Implement JTI tracking for refresh tokens to provide a unique identifier for each token, facilitating more robust replay attack detection and revocation.
* **Granular Scopes for Refresh Tokens:** Consider allowing for more fine-grained control over the authorization scopes granted by refresh tokens, potentially limiting the impact of a compromised refresh token.
* **Integration with Various Authentication Protocols:** Expand the library's compatibility to seamlessly integrate with different authentication protocols and grant types beyond basic password grants.
* **Concurrent Refresh Request Handling:** Implement strategies to handle concurrent refresh requests gracefully, preventing race conditions and ensuring only one valid refresh token is issued.
