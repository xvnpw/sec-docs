# Attack Surface Analysis for tttattributedlabel/tttattributedlabel

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Attributes](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_attributes.md)

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Attributes**
    * **Description:** Injection of malicious JavaScript code into a web page, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser.
    * **How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** The library parses and renders HTML-like attributes within attributed strings. If user-controlled data is used to construct these strings without proper sanitization, malicious JavaScript can be injected within attributes like `href` in `<a>` tags or event handlers.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects the following attributed string: `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click Me</a>`. When rendered by `tttattributedlabel`, clicking the link will execute the JavaScript alert.
    * **Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application, and potential data theft.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data before using it to construct attributed strings. Escape HTML entities, especially for characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'`.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS.
        * **Output Encoding:** Ensure that the output rendered by `tttattributedlabel` is properly encoded for the context in which it is displayed (e.g., HTML encoding).

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect via Unvalidated URLs](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect_via_unvalidated_urls.md)

* **Open Redirect via Unvalidated URLs**
    * **Description:**  An attacker manipulates a website's URL to redirect users to a malicious website without their knowledge.
    * **How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** The library handles tappable links within the attributed text. If the URLs within these links are directly derived from user input without validation, an attacker can inject malicious URLs.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides an attributed string with a link like `<a href="https://evil.com">Click Here</a>`. When a user clicks this link, they are redirected to `evil.com`.
    * **Impact:** Phishing attacks, malware distribution, and damage to the application's reputation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **URL Validation and Whitelisting:** Validate all URLs before rendering them as tappable links. Implement a whitelist of allowed URL schemes (e.g., `http://`, `https://`) and potentially allowed domains.
        * **Avoid Direct User Input in URLs:** If possible, avoid directly using user input to construct URLs. Instead, use predefined or validated identifiers that map to internal or trusted external resources.
        * **Inform Users of Redirections:** If redirection is necessary, provide a clear indication to the user that they are being redirected to an external site.

## Attack Surface: [Interaction with Custom URL Schemes (Application-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/interaction_with_custom_url_schemes__application-specific_.md)

* **Interaction with Custom URL Schemes (Application-Specific)**
    * **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise from how the application handles custom URL schemes triggered by links within the attributed text.
    * **How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** The library facilitates the creation of tappable links with custom URL schemes. If the application's handling of these schemes is flawed, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts an attributed string with a custom URL scheme like `myapp://dothings?command=deleteall`, and the application naively executes this command without proper authorization or validation.
    * **Impact:**  Execution of unintended actions within the application, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Handling of Custom URL Schemes:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data passed through custom URL schemes.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that actions triggered by custom URL schemes are performed with the minimum necessary privileges.
        * **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement proper authentication and authorization checks before executing actions based on custom URL schemes.
