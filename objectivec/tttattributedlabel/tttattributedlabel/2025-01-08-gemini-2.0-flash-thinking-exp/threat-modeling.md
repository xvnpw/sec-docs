# Threat Model Analysis for tttattributedlabel/tttattributedlabel

## Threat: [Malicious URL Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_url_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts attributed text containing a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript. When `tttattributedlabel` renders this text and a user clicks the crafted link, the JavaScript code executes in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing other unauthorized actions. This threat directly arises from `tttattributedlabel`'s handling of URLs.
*   **Impact:**  Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
*   **Affected Component:**  `TTTAttributedLabel`'s URL parsing and link rendering functionality. Specifically, the code responsible for creating `<a>` tags from detected URLs.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on any user-provided text that will be processed by `tttattributedlabel`.
    *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    *   Ensure `tttattributedlabel` or the surrounding code properly encodes URLs before rendering them as links, preventing the execution of embedded JavaScript.

## Threat: [Abuse of Custom URL Schemes for Client-Side Exploitation](./threats/abuse_of_custom_url_schemes_for_client-side_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts attributed text containing a malicious custom URL scheme (e.g., `file://`, `ms-office:`) that, when clicked, could trigger unintended actions or vulnerabilities in the user's operating system or other installed applications. This threat is directly related to how `tttattributedlabel` interprets and handles different URL schemes.
*   **Impact:**  Local file access, execution of arbitrary applications, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in other software.
*   **Affected Component:**  `TTTAttributedLabel`'s URL parsing and handling of different URL schemes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Whitelist only explicitly allowed and safe URL schemes within the application's configuration or within `tttattributedlabel`'s configuration if possible.
    *   Sanitize custom URL schemes to prevent the execution of potentially harmful actions.
    *   Warn users before navigating to custom URL schemes or provide options to disable the handling of such schemes.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Clickable Elements leading to Unintended Application Actions](./threats/manipulation_of_clickable_elements_leading_to_unintended_application_actions.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `tttattributedlabel` to render interactive elements with custom actions or callbacks, an attacker might be able to manipulate the attributes or structure of these elements *within the attributed text processed by `tttattributedlabel`* to trigger unintended functionalities within the application. This directly involves how `tttattributedlabel` creates and handles interactive elements.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to application features, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:**  The application's code that integrates with `tttattributedlabel` and defines custom actions for interactive elements, in conjunction with `tttattributedlabel`'s rendering of those elements.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully validate and sanitize any data associated with interactive elements *before* it is processed by `tttattributedlabel` and again before processing user interactions.
    *   Implement proper authorization checks for any actions triggered by clicks on elements rendered by `tttattributedlabel`.
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side logic for critical actions.
