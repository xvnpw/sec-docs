# Attack Surface Analysis for tttattributedlabel/tttattributedlabel

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Attributed Strings](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_attributed_strings.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft overly complex or malformed attributed strings to cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) during parsing or rendering.
    *   **TTTAttributedLabel Contribution:**  The library's core function is to process and render attributed strings, making it the direct entry point for this attack. It relies on underlying frameworks (Core Text, `NSAttributedString`), inheriting their potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides an attributed string with millions of nested attributes, extremely long ranges, or invalid attribute combinations.
    *   **Impact:** Application hangs, crashes, or becomes unresponsive, affecting availability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly limit the length and complexity of attributed strings *before* passing them to `TTTAttributedLabel`.  Define maximum character limits, nesting levels, and allowed attribute types.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor CPU and memory usage during attributed string processing.  Implement alerts and potentially terminate processing if thresholds are exceeded.
        *   **Timeouts:**  Set reasonable timeouts for rendering operations to prevent indefinite hangs.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to test the application with a wide range of malformed and edge-case attributed strings.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** If the attributed strings come from user input, implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from flooding the application with malicious strings.

## Attack Surface: [URL Scheme Hijacking/Redirection](./attack_surfaces/url_scheme_hijackingredirection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can embed malicious URLs within the attributed string, which, when tapped, could redirect the user to phishing sites or trigger unintended actions via custom URL schemes.
    *   **TTTAttributedLabel Contribution:** The library's link detection and handling features (both automatic data detectors and custom link attributes) provide the mechanism for these URLs to be activated.
    *   **Example:** An attacker includes a link like `myapp://doSomethingDangerous?param=malicious_value` or a disguised phishing link like `https://realbank.com.attacker.com`.
    *   **Impact:**  Phishing, data theft, unauthorized actions within the app or other apps on the device, potential compromise of user accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict URL Whitelisting:**  *Only* allow specific, trusted URL schemes and domains.  Maintain a whitelist and reject any URL that doesn't match.
        *   **User Confirmation:**  Before opening *any* URL, display a clear, prominent warning to the user, showing the *full* URL and requiring explicit confirmation.  Do *not* rely on automatic opening.
        *   **Disable Automatic Link Detection (if possible):** If automatic link detection is not essential, disable it to reduce the attack surface.
        *   **Validate Custom URL Schemes:** If custom URL schemes are used, implement rigorous validation to ensure they conform to expected formats and parameters.  Prevent injection of arbitrary commands or data.
        *   **Avoid `tel://` and `sms://` without explicit user consent and validation:** These can be abused for toll fraud or spam. Implement strong validation and user confirmation.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Injection (XSS) via WebView](./attack_surfaces/javascript_injection__xss__via_webview.md)

*   **Description:** If a tapped link opens a `WKWebView` or `UIWebView` (even indirectly), and the URL is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
    *   **TTTAttributedLabel Contribution:** The library's link handling can lead to the opening of a `WebView`, creating the potential for XSS if the URL is not properly handled.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `https://example.com?param=<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which, when loaded in a `WebView`, executes the injected JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and potentially full control over the application's `WebView` context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid WebViews for Untrusted Content:**  The best mitigation is to *avoid* using a `WebView` to display content from URLs extracted from `TTTAttributedLabel`.  Explore alternative ways to display the content (e.g., native UI elements).
        *   **Strict URL Sanitization and Validation:** If a `WebView` *must* be used, implement extremely rigorous URL sanitization and validation.  Use a dedicated URL parsing library and escape any potentially dangerous characters.  Validate the URL against a whitelist of allowed domains and paths.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP within the `WebView` to limit the resources it can load and the actions it can perform (e.g., disallow inline scripts, restrict allowed domains).
        *   **Sandboxing (WKWebView):** Prefer `WKWebView` over `UIWebView` as it offers better sandboxing and security features.
        *   **Input Validation (again):** Even before the URL reaches the WebView, validate the input that *creates* the URL within the attributed string.
