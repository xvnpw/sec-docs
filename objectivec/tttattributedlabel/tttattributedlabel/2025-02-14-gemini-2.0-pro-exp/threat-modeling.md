# Threat Model Analysis for tttattributedlabel/tttattributedlabel

## Threat: [URL Redirection via Delegate Hijacking (attributedLabel:didSelectLinkWithURL:)](./threats/url_redirection_via_delegate_hijacking__attributedlabeldidselectlinkwithurl_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that results in a seemingly harmless link being displayed within a `TTTAttributedLabel`.  When the user clicks this link, the attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's *implementation* of the `attributedLabel:didSelectLinkWithURL:` delegate method.  The attacker's goal is to redirect the user to a malicious URL *different* from the one displayed in the label. This attack hinges on the application failing to properly validate the URL *within the delegate method itself*.
    *   **Impact:** Users are transparently redirected to malicious websites. This can lead to phishing attacks (stealing credentials), malware downloads, drive-by downloads, or other serious security compromises. The user believes they are navigating to a legitimate site, but the application is secretly sending them elsewhere.
    *   **Affected Component:** `TTTAttributedLabelDelegate` protocol, specifically the required `attributedLabel:didSelectLinkWithURL:` method. This is a direct interaction point with `TTTAttributedLabel`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory URL Validation (Within Delegate):**  The most crucial mitigation is to *always* rigorously validate the `NSURL` parameter passed to the `attributedLabel:didSelectLinkWithURL:` method *before* performing *any* action with it (e.g., opening it in a browser, making network requests). Do *not* assume the URL is safe simply because it originated from the `TTTAttributedLabel`.
        *   **Strict URL Whitelisting:** If feasible, maintain a whitelist of permitted domains or URL prefixes.  Reject any URL that does not match this whitelist. This provides a strong defense against redirection attacks.
        *   **User Confirmation (with Full URL):** Before opening any URL, consider displaying a confirmation dialog to the user. This dialog should prominently show the *complete* URL the user is about to visit, allowing them to visually inspect it for any discrepancies.
        *   **Prefer `SFSafariViewController`:** When opening URLs in a web view, strongly prefer using `SFSafariViewController` (or its modern equivalent) over directly using `UIWebView` or `WKWebView`. `SFSafariViewController` offers a more secure browsing environment and isolates the browsing context, reducing the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Attribute Spoofing via linkAttributes and activeLinkAttributes](./threats/attribute_spoofing_via_linkattributes_and_activelinkattributes.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker crafts malicious input designed to manipulate the `linkAttributes` and `activeLinkAttributes` dictionaries of a `TTTAttributedLabel`. The attacker's aim is to alter the visual appearance of links (color, font, underline, etc.) to make them deceptively resemble legitimate links pointing to trusted websites (e.g., "yourbank.com"). However, the underlying `NSURL` associated with the link actually directs the user to a phishing site or a site hosting malware. The attacker might also mimic the appearance of UI buttons to trick users into clicking malicious links.
    *   **Impact:** Users are tricked into clicking on malicious links disguised as legitimate ones. This leads to phishing attacks where user credentials are stolen, malware is installed on the user's device, or other harmful actions are performed.
    *   **Affected Component:** `TTTAttributedLabel` properties: `linkAttributes`, `activeLinkAttributes`.  Also, any methods that set or modify these attributes, such as `setText:afterInheritingLabelAttributesAndConfiguringWithBlock:` (if used to configure link attributes), and the `attributedText` property if user-provided data directly influences its content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Trust User Input for Attributes:**  Crucially, *never* directly use user-supplied input to construct the values for `linkAttributes` or `activeLinkAttributes`. This is the primary vulnerability.
        *   **Strict Attribute Whitelisting:** Define a precise whitelist of allowed attributes and their corresponding values for links.  Reject any input that attempts to set attributes or values outside of this predefined whitelist.
        *   **Visual Link Differentiation:** Ensure that links are always visually distinct from other text and UI elements within the application. Avoid using styles that could be easily imitated to create deceptive links. Use clear visual cues to indicate links.
        *   **Input Sanitization (if necessary):** If you must allow *some* user control over link appearance (which is generally discouraged), rigorously sanitize the input to remove any potentially dangerous attributes or values before applying them.
