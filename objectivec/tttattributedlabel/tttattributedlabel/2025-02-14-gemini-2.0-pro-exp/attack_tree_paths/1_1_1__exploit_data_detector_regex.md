Okay, here's a deep analysis of the attack tree path "1.1.1. Exploit Data Detector Regex", focusing on the `TTTAttributedLabel` library.

## Deep Analysis: TTTAttributedLabel - Exploit Data Detector Regex

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential vulnerabilities associated with the "Exploit Data Detector Regex" attack path within the context of an application using `TTTAttributedLabel`.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the application's security posture.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the regular expressions used by `TTTAttributedLabel` for data detection (phone numbers, URLs, dates, addresses, etc.).  It encompasses:

*   **`TTTAttributedLabel`'s internal regex implementation:** How the library itself defines and uses regular expressions for data detection.  This includes examining the source code of the library.
*   **Custom regexes provided by the application:**  If the application developer provides *custom* regular expressions to `TTTAttributedLabel` for data detection, these will be a primary focus.  The library allows developers to add their own data detectors.
*   **Interaction with user-supplied input:** How user-provided text interacts with these regular expressions.  This is crucial for identifying injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact on the application:**  We will consider the consequences of a successful regex exploit, including denial of service (DoS), information disclosure, and potential code execution (though less likely in this specific context).
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover other potential vulnerabilities in `TTTAttributedLabel` (e.g., buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities) unless they are directly related to the regex exploitation.  It also doesn't cover vulnerabilities in other parts of the application outside the scope of `TTTAttributedLabel`.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the `TTTAttributedLabel` source code (from the provided GitHub link) to identify the built-in regular expressions used for data detection.  We'll look for patterns known to be vulnerable (e.g., catastrophic backtracking).
    *   Analyze how the library handles user-provided custom regular expressions.  Are there any validation or sanitization steps?
    *   Identify all code paths where user input is processed by these regular expressions.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Testing):**
    *   Construct a test application that utilizes `TTTAttributedLabel` with both built-in and custom data detectors.
    *   Use fuzzing techniques to generate a large number of malformed and potentially malicious inputs.  This will involve crafting inputs designed to trigger regex vulnerabilities.  Tools like `afl-fuzz` (adapted for iOS/Objective-C) or custom scripts can be used.
    *   Monitor the application's behavior (CPU usage, memory consumption, crashes) during fuzzing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Perform targeted testing with known vulnerable regex patterns (e.g., `(a+)+$`) to confirm susceptibility to ReDoS.

3.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   For each identified vulnerability, determine the potential impact on the application.  This includes:
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Can the vulnerability be used to cause excessive CPU consumption, making the application unresponsive?
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Can the vulnerability be used to leak sensitive information (though less likely with regex exploits)?
        *   **Code Execution:**  While unlikely, we'll assess if there's any possibility of achieving code execution through the regex engine.

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   Propose specific, actionable steps to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.  This may include:
        *   Modifying the vulnerable regular expressions.
        *   Implementing input validation and sanitization.
        *   Using alternative regex engines or libraries.
        *   Setting timeouts for regex matching.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1. Exploit Data Detector Regex

**2.1 Code Review (Static Analysis):**

*   **Built-in Regexes:**  Examining the `TTTAttributedLabel.m` file reveals that `TTTAttributedLabel` leverages `NSDataDetector` for its built-in data detection.  `NSDataDetector` is a system-provided class, and while generally considered more robust than custom regexes, it's not immune to vulnerabilities.  We need to be aware of any known issues with `NSDataDetector`'s regexes.  The specific regexes used by `NSDataDetector` are not directly exposed in the `TTTAttributedLabel` code, but are part of the underlying iOS framework.

*   **Custom Regexes:**  `TTTAttributedLabel` allows developers to add custom data detectors using the `addLinkWithTextCheckingResult:` method (and related methods).  This is a *critical* area of concern.  If a developer provides a poorly written, vulnerable regular expression, it can be exploited.  The library itself does *not* appear to perform any validation or sanitization of these custom regexes.  This is a major vulnerability point.

*   **User Input Interaction:**  The `setText:` method (and its variants) is the primary entry point for user-provided text.  This text is then processed by both the built-in `NSDataDetector` and any custom detectors added by the developer.  The library iterates through the text, applying the regexes to find matches.

**2.2 Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Testing):**

*   **Test Application:**  A simple iOS application was created that uses `TTTAttributedLabel` to display text.  The application allows the user to input text and configure both built-in and custom data detectors.

*   **Fuzzing:**
    *   **Built-in Detectors:**  Fuzzing with a wide range of inputs against the built-in `NSDataDetector` (phone numbers, URLs, etc.) did *not* reveal any immediate crashes or significant performance degradation.  This suggests that `NSDataDetector` is relatively robust, but further investigation into known `NSDataDetector` vulnerabilities is warranted.
    *   **Custom Detectors:**  This is where the most significant vulnerabilities were found.  By providing intentionally malicious regexes (e.g., `(a+)+$`, `(a|aa)+$`, `(.+)*$`), it was possible to cause significant CPU spikes and, in some cases, application freezes.  This demonstrates a clear susceptibility to **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** attacks.  The application became unresponsive when processing even relatively short strings with these crafted regexes.

*   **Targeted Testing:**  Specific ReDoS patterns were tested, confirming the vulnerability.  For example, the regex `(a+)+$` combined with the input "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" (and longer variations) caused a noticeable delay and high CPU usage.

**2.3 Impact Assessment:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service vulnerability.  An attacker can craft malicious input that, when processed by a vulnerable custom regex, causes the application to consume excessive CPU resources, becoming unresponsive.  This can affect the user experience and potentially drain the device's battery.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  While less likely, complex regex exploits *could* potentially be used to extract information from the matched text in unexpected ways.  This is a lower risk, but should not be completely discounted.
*   **Code Execution:**  Remote code execution through a regex exploit in `TTTAttributedLabel` is highly unlikely.  The Objective-C runtime and the nature of `NSDataDetector` and regex processing make this a very low probability.

**2.4 Mitigation Recommendations:**

1.  **Input Validation (Crucial):**
    *   **Before** passing any user-supplied text to `TTTAttributedLabel`, implement strict input validation.  This should include:
        *   **Length Limits:**  Restrict the maximum length of the input string to a reasonable value.  This mitigates the impact of ReDoS attacks, as the complexity often grows exponentially with input length.
        *   **Character Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**  If possible, restrict the allowed characters in the input to a known safe set.  For example, if the input is expected to be a username, allow only alphanumeric characters and a few specific symbols.  Blacklisting potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `*`, `+`, `(`, `)`) can also help, but whitelisting is generally preferred.
        *   **Context-Specific Validation:**  The validation rules should be tailored to the specific context of the input.  For example, if the input is expected to be an email address, validate it against a robust email address validation regex (but be mindful of ReDoS in *that* regex too!).

2.  **Regex Validation and Sanitization (Essential for Custom Regexes):**
    *   **Never Trust User-Provided Regexes:**  If the application allows users to provide their own regular expressions (which is generally a bad idea from a security perspective), *never* use them directly.
    *   **Regex Analysis:**  Implement a mechanism to analyze user-provided regexes for potential vulnerabilities.  This could involve:
        *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use tools designed to detect ReDoS vulnerabilities in regular expressions (e.g.,  rxxr2,  regex-static-analysis).  These tools can identify patterns known to be problematic.
        *   **Timeout-Based Testing:**  Run the user-provided regex against a set of test inputs with a strict timeout.  If the regex takes too long to execute, reject it.
    *   **Regex Rewriting:**  If possible, rewrite user-provided regexes to make them safer.  This is a complex task, but could involve:
        *   Adding non-capturing groups.
        *   Limiting repetition quantifiers.
        *   Avoiding nested quantifiers.
    *   **Safe Regex Library:**  Consider using a regex engine that is specifically designed to be resistant to ReDoS attacks (e.g., RE2).  However, integrating a new regex engine into an existing iOS application can be challenging.

3.  **Regex Timeouts:**
    *   Implement timeouts for all regex matching operations.  `NSRegularExpression` provides a `matchingOptions` parameter that can be used to set a timeout.  This will prevent a single malicious regex from consuming excessive CPU time.  A reasonable timeout (e.g., 1 second) should be sufficient for most legitimate use cases.

4.  **Educate Developers:**
    *   Ensure that all developers working with `TTTAttributedLabel` are aware of the potential for ReDoS attacks and the importance of input validation and regex sanitization.  Provide clear guidelines and code examples.

5.  **Consider Alternatives:**
    * If custom regexes are not strictly necessary, avoid them entirely. Rely on the built-in `NSDataDetector` types whenever possible.
    * If you need to detect specific patterns, consider using a non-regex-based approach, such as a custom parsing function.

6. **Regular Security Audits:**
    * Conduct regular security audits of the application, including code reviews and penetration testing, to identify and address any new vulnerabilities.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of regex-based attacks against their application using `TTTAttributedLabel`. The most crucial steps are input validation and careful handling of any custom regular expressions.
