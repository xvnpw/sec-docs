# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `tttattributedlabel`, provides a Python library for attributing labels to text. The primary business goal is to offer a reusable and efficient tool for developers and data scientists who need to work with labeled text data. This library aims to simplify the process of managing and applying labels to textual content, potentially for tasks like natural language processing, machine learning, or data analysis.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a functional and reliable Python library for text labeling.
- Ensure the library is easy to use and integrate into existing projects.
- Maintain the library's quality and address bug fixes or feature requests.
- Potentially expand the library's features based on user needs and community contributions.

Business Risks:
- Lack of adoption by the target audience if the library is not user-friendly or feature-rich enough.
- Bugs or vulnerabilities in the library could lead to incorrect data labeling or security issues in applications using the library.
- Poor documentation or lack of maintenance could deter users and limit the library's lifespan.
- Dependency conflicts with other libraries could hinder integration and usability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: GitHub repository hosting with standard GitHub security features (access control, vulnerability scanning). Implemented by: GitHub platform.
- security control: Open-source project with community review potential. Implemented by: Open-source nature of the project.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on open-source dependencies, which may have their own vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities inherent in software code, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates.
- accepted risk: Potential for misuse of the library in unintended or insecure ways by end-users.

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- recommended security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Provide clear documentation on secure usage practices and potential security considerations for users of the library.
- recommended security control: Implement input validation within the library to handle unexpected or malicious input gracefully and prevent potential issues in applications using the library.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use this library.
- Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use this library.
- Input Validation: The library should perform input validation to ensure that the data it processes is in the expected format and range. This is crucial to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities when the library is used with untrusted input. Validation should be applied to all external inputs to the library's functions.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is likely not a core requirement for this library as it primarily deals with text labeling. However, if future features involve handling sensitive data or secure communication, appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered. For now, no specific cryptographic requirements are identified.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing a functional and reliable text labeling library to users.
- Maintaining the quality and usability of the library over time.
- Ensuring the library is secure and does not introduce vulnerabilities into user applications.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- The library itself (source code): Moderate sensitivity. Integrity and availability are important to maintain the project. Confidentiality is less critical as it is open source.
- User data processed by the library: Sensitivity depends entirely on the context of use. The library itself does not store or manage user data, but applications using it will. The library should be designed to handle data securely, regardless of sensitivity.
- Build and release artifacts: Moderate sensitivity. Integrity is important to ensure users download and install a trustworthy and untampered library.
