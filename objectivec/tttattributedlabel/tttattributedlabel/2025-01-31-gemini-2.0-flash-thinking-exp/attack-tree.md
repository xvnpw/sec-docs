## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious URL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_url_injection.md)

**Attack Vector Description:** This is the primary high-risk attack vector. An attacker aims to inject malicious URLs into text that is processed and rendered by `tttattributedlabel`. The library's functionality of automatically detecting and making URLs tappable is exploited to deliver malicious links to users.

*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   **Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker creates a URL designed for malicious purposes. Examples include:
        *   **Phishing URLs:** Links that redirect to fake login pages or data harvesting sites, mimicking legitimate services to steal user credentials or sensitive information.
        *   **Malware Download URLs:** Links that directly initiate the download of malicious applications or files onto the user's device.
        *   **XSS Payload URLs (If WebView is used):** URLs crafted to execute client-side scripts if the application uses a WebView to render the attributed text and handle URL actions, and if proper sanitization is lacking.
        *   **Application-Specific Exploit URLs:** URLs that target vulnerabilities in the application's custom URL handling logic, such as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the application fetches content based on the URL.
    *   **Inject Malicious URL in Text Input:** The attacker finds a way to inject this crafted malicious URL into text input that will be processed by the application and subsequently by `tttattributedlabel`. This could be through:
        *   User-generated content fields (e.g., comments, messages, profiles).
        *   Data feeds or external sources that the application displays.
        *   Direct input if the application allows users to input text directly.
    *   **tttattributedlabel Parses and Renders Malicious URL:** The `tttattributedlabel` library, as designed, automatically detects the URL within the text input and renders it as an attributed link, making it tappable for users. This step is crucial for the attack as it visually highlights and enables interaction with the malicious link.
    *   **User Interacts with Malicious Link:** The attacker relies on social engineering or user curiosity to entice the user to click or tap on the malicious link.
    *   **User Clicks/Taps on the Malicious Link:** The user, believing the link to be legitimate or out of curiosity, interacts with the link.
    *   **Exploitation upon Click:** Upon clicking the malicious link, one of the following can occur:
        *   **Phishing Attack:** The user is redirected to a phishing website designed to steal credentials or personal information.
        *   **Malware Download:** The user's device begins downloading malware, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or ransomware infection.
        *   **Client-Side Exploitation (XSS):** If a WebView is involved and vulnerable, XSS payloads in the URL can execute malicious scripts within the user's browser context.
        *   **Application-Specific Vulnerability Exploitation (e.g., SSRF):** The application's custom URL handling logic is triggered, leading to unintended actions like SSRF.

*   **Risk Factors:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** Injecting URLs is a common and easily achievable attack.
    *   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to significant damage, including data breaches, account compromise, and malware infections.
    *   **Low Effort:** Crafting and injecting URLs requires minimal effort and resources for the attacker.
    *   **Low Skill Level:**  This attack can be carried out by attackers with relatively low technical skills.
    *   **Medium to Very High Detection Difficulty:** Detecting malicious URLs within content can be challenging, especially for phishing attacks that use convincing domain names and website designs. User interaction (clicking the link) is very difficult to detect in advance.

**Mitigation Focus:**

The primary focus for mitigation should be on preventing the successful exploitation of Malicious URL Injection. This involves robust application-side input validation, sanitization, user education, and potentially URL whitelisting/blacklisting strategies.
