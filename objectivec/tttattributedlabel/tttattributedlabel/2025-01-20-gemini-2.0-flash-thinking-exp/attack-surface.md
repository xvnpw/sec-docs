# Attack Surface Analysis for tttattributedlabel/tttattributedlabel

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted URLs in Links](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_urls_in_links.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious URLs within the attributed text that, when clicked, can lead to various attacks.

**How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** The library parses and renders URLs, making them clickable. It doesn't inherently validate the safety of these URLs.

**Example:** An attacker injects the text: `Click <a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">here</a>`. When rendered by `TTTAttributedLabel` and clicked, it could execute JavaScript.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), phishing attacks, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the application handles the click server-side, data exfiltration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user-provided text before passing it to `TTTAttributedLabel`, removing or escaping potentially harmful URL schemes like `javascript:`. 
    * **URL Whitelisting:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed URL schemes and domains. Reject or sanitize URLs that don't match the whitelist.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Custom URL Schemes](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_custom_url_schemes.md)

**Description:** `TTTAttributedLabel` allows handling custom URL schemes. If not properly validated, attackers can exploit this to trigger unintended application behavior.

**How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** The library recognizes and can make custom URL schemes clickable, potentially triggering application logic associated with those schemes.

**Example:** An attacker injects text with a custom scheme: `Open <a href="myapp://sensitive_action?param=malicious_data">here</a>`. If the application blindly processes `myapp://` URLs, this could lead to unintended actions.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code (if the application directly interprets the scheme), access to sensitive data, triggering unintended application functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * **Strict Validation of Custom Schemes:** Implement rigorous validation for all custom URL schemes and their parameters before processing them.
    * **Avoid Direct Execution:**  Do not directly execute commands or access sensitive resources based solely on the custom URL scheme. Implement a secure mapping and validation layer.

## Attack Surface: [Injection of Malicious Attributes (Hashtags, Mentions, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/injection_of_malicious_attributes__hashtags__mentions__etc__.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious strings within attributes like hashtags or mentions that, while not directly executable by the library, could be misinterpreted or exploited by the application's logic that processes these attributes.

**How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** The library parses and identifies these attributes, making them available for the application to process. It doesn't inherently sanitize the content within these attributes.

**Example:** An attacker injects the text: `Check out #<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If the application extracts hashtags and uses them in a search query without sanitization, it could lead to XSS.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (if attributes are used in web contexts), command injection (if attributes are used in system commands), data manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * **Sanitize Extracted Attributes:**  Thoroughly sanitize any data extracted from `TTTAttributedLabel` attributes before using it in any further processing, especially in web contexts or system commands.
    * **Context-Specific Encoding:** Encode the extracted attribute data appropriately for the context where it will be used (e.g., HTML encoding for web pages).
