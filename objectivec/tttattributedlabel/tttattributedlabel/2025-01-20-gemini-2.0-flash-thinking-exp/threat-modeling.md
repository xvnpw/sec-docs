# Threat Model Analysis for tttattributedlabel/tttattributedlabel

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious `href` Attributes](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious__href__attributes.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within the `href` attribute of a link rendered by `tttattributedlabel`. When a user clicks on this link, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform actions on their behalf. This directly involves how `tttattributedlabel` parses and renders `<a>` tags.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious websites, information theft.

**Affected Component:** `Link Detection` and `Rendering` logic within `tttattributedlabel` that handles `<a>` tags and their `href` attributes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize a reputable HTML sanitization library on the server-side or client-side *before* passing attributed text to `tttattributedlabel`. This library should effectively remove or escape potentially harmful JavaScript within `href` attributes.
*   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and prevent inline script execution.
*   Avoid directly rendering user-provided or external data without proper sanitization.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom Attributes with Event Handlers](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_custom_attributes_with_event_handlers.md)

**Description:** If `tttattributedlabel` allows rendering of custom attributes and the *library itself* renders these attributes in a way that allows execution of JavaScript (e.g., by directly setting attributes that are known to execute scripts like `onload`, `onerror`), an attacker could inject malicious scripts. This is a direct vulnerability within `tttattributedlabel`'s attribute rendering.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious websites, information theft.

**Affected Component:** `Attribute Parsing` and `Rendering` logic within `tttattributedlabel` that handles custom attributes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Review the source code of `tttattributedlabel` to ensure it does not directly render custom attributes in a way that allows script execution.
*   If using custom attributes, ensure `tttattributedlabel` escapes or sanitizes their values before rendering.
*   Avoid relying on `tttattributedlabel` to handle potentially dangerous attributes without explicit sanitization.
