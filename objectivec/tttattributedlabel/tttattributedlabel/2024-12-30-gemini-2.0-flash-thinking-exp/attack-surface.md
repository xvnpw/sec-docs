*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Link Injection**
    *   **Description:**  A malicious actor injects specially crafted URLs within the text processed by `TTTAttributedLabel`.
    *   **How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** The library automatically detects and renders URLs present in the input string, making these links interactive.
    *   **Example:**  A user-generated comment contains a link like `http://evil.example.com/phishing`. When rendered by `TTTAttributedLabel`, this becomes a clickable link.
    *   **Impact:** Users clicking on the malicious link can be redirected to phishing sites, malware download pages, or sites that exploit browser vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Implement server-side or client-side sanitization to remove or neutralize potentially malicious URLs before they are processed by `TTTAttributedLabel`.
        *   **URL Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**  Maintain a list of allowed or disallowed domains and check URLs against these lists before rendering.
        *   **Confirmation Dialogs:**  Display a confirmation dialog before navigating to external URLs, especially those from untrusted sources.

*   **Attack Surface: Custom URL Scheme Abuse**
    *   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted links using custom URL schemes registered by the application are injected.
    *   **How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** The library recognizes and makes clickable custom URL schemes present in the text.
    *   **Example:**  An injected text contains a link like `myapp://dothings/delete_all_data`. If the application doesn't properly handle this deep link, it could lead to unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Exploitation of custom URL schemes can lead to unauthorized actions within the application, data manipulation, or bypassing security checks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Validation of Custom URL Scheme Parameters:**  Thoroughly validate all parameters passed through custom URL schemes before performing any actions.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that actions triggered by custom URL schemes have the minimum necessary privileges.

*   **Attack Surface: `javascript:` URL Execution**
    *   **Description:**  Injection of `javascript:` URLs that, if executed, can run arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context.
    *   **How TTTAttributedLabel Contributes:** If the library allows the execution of `javascript:` URLs without proper filtering, it directly enables this attack vector.
    *   **Example:**  A malicious text contains the link `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click Me</a>`. If `TTTAttributedLabel` renders this and the underlying system executes the JavaScript, it leads to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable or Filter `javascript:` URLs:**  The most effective mitigation is to prevent the execution of `javascript:` URLs altogether. Configure `TTTAttributedLabel` or the underlying link handling mechanism to block or sanitize these URLs.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP that disallows inline JavaScript execution.
