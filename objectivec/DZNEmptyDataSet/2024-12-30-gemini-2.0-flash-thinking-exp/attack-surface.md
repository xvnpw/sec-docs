*   **Attack Surface: Data Injection through Customization**
    *   **Description:** Malicious code or content is injected into the text or image attributes of the empty dataset view.
    *   **How DZNEmptyDataSet Contributes:** The library provides APIs to set the title, description, and button titles, as well as custom images. If the application uses unsanitized user-provided data for these attributes, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could provide a malicious string containing JavaScript code as the empty dataset title. If the application renders this without proper escaping, the script could execute within the app's context.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), UI redressing, content spoofing, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or phishing attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and validation for all text data provided to `DZNEmptyDataSet`. Escape HTML characters and other potentially harmful sequences.
        *   Validate the source and format of images used in the empty dataset to prevent loading malicious or excessively large files.
        *   Consider using content security policies (CSPs) where applicable to further restrict the execution of scripts.

*   **Attack Surface: Logic Bugs in Customization Callbacks**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the application's implementation of `DZNEmptyDataSet`'s delegate or data source methods can be exploited.
    *   **How DZNEmptyDataSet Contributes:** The library relies on delegates and data sources for customizing behavior, such as handling button taps. If these methods contain insecure logic, it introduces risk.
    *   **Example:** The application's button tap handler in the `emptyDataSet:didTapButton:` delegate method might construct a URL using unsanitized user input, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Open redirects, unauthorized actions, potential privilege escalation depending on the logic implemented in the callbacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the implementation of all delegate and data source methods used with `DZNEmptyDataSet`.
        *   Ensure proper input validation and sanitization within these methods, especially when handling user-provided data or constructing URLs.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing button actions and other interactive elements.
