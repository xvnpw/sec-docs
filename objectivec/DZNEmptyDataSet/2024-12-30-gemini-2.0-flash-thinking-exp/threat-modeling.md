* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Configuration
    * **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code if the application uses unsanitized user-provided data or data from untrusted sources to configure the text displayed by DZNEmptyDataSet (e.g., the `titleLabelString`, `descriptionLabelString`, or button titles). When the empty state is rendered, this malicious script would execute in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the application.
    * **Affected Component:** Display logic (specifically how the configured text is rendered in the UI).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and encode all user-provided data or data from untrusted sources before using it to configure the text properties of DZNEmptyDataSet.
        * Utilize appropriate output encoding techniques to prevent the interpretation of malicious scripts.
        * Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.

* **Threat:** Malicious Actions Triggered by Buttons
    * **Description:** An attacker could potentially influence the action triggered by a button in the DZNEmptyDataSet configuration (if the configuration mechanism is vulnerable) to perform unintended or malicious operations within the application. This could involve triggering API calls with manipulated parameters or initiating actions that the user did not intend.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, access to restricted resources, or triggering unintended application functionality.
    * **Affected Component:** Button interaction logic (specifically the code that handles button taps and executes associated actions).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure that button actions are properly validated and authorized before execution.
        * Avoid directly mapping user-provided data to critical application actions without thorough validation.
        * Implement the principle of least privilege for button actions.
