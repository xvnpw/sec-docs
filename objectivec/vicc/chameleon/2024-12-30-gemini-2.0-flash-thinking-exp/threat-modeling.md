* **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into template input that is then interpreted and executed by the Chameleon template engine on the server. This can be done by manipulating user-provided data that is directly embedded into a template without proper sanitization.
    * **Impact:**  Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server, access sensitive data, modify data, or launch further attacks.
    * **Affected Chameleon Component:** Template Rendering Engine (specifically the expression evaluation and directive processing parts).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid embedding user-provided data directly into templates. If necessary, sanitize and escape the data rigorously before embedding.
        * Utilize Chameleon's built-in escaping mechanisms for all user-controlled data displayed in templates. Understand the context-specific escaping requirements.
        * Consider using a template engine that offers automatic contextual escaping by default.
        * Regularly audit template code for potential injection points.

* **Threat:** Security Vulnerabilities in Chameleon Library
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist within the Chameleon library itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of Chameleon.
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.
    * **Affected Chameleon Component:** Any part of the Chameleon library code.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the Chameleon library to the latest stable version. Stay informed about security advisories and patch releases.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the Chameleon dependency and its transitive dependencies.
        * Monitor security mailing lists and changelogs for Chameleon to stay aware of potential issues.
