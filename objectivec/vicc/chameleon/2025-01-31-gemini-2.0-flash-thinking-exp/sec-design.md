# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, named 'chameleon', is a Swift library designed for color manipulation. The primary business goal is to provide Swift developers with a robust, efficient, and easy-to-use tool for working with colors in their applications. This aims to improve developer productivity and potentially enhance the visual appeal and user experience of Swift-based applications.

Key business priorities include:
- Ease of use and integration for Swift developers.
- Performance and efficiency of color manipulations.
- Reliability and correctness of color calculations.
- Maintainability and extensibility of the library.
- Community adoption and positive developer feedback.

Most important business risks to address:
- Low adoption rate due to lack of features, poor documentation, or competition from other libraries.
- Bugs or inaccuracies in color calculations leading to incorrect application behavior and negative user experience.
- Performance bottlenecks impacting application responsiveness.
- Security vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using the library.
- Lack of community support and contributions leading to stagnation and eventual obsolescence.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
- security control: Open-source license (MIT License) allows for community review and contributions. (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be introduced during development.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Introduce dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in any external dependencies (though this library seems to have minimal dependencies).
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security best practices.
- security control: Provide documentation and examples that promote secure usage of the library, especially regarding input validation if the library processes external color inputs.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Authentication is relevant for systems that use this library, not the library itself.
- Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Authorization is relevant for systems that use this library, not the library itself.
- Input validation: The library should perform input validation on any color parameters it accepts to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to malformed input. This is especially important if color inputs can originate from external sources in applications using the library.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is likely not a core requirement for a color manipulation library. However, if there are features involving secure color representation or manipulation (which is unlikely), appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered. For now, cryptography is not considered a primary security requirement.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process: Providing a reliable and secure color manipulation library to Swift developers.

Data we are trying to protect:
- Source code of the Chameleon library: Sensitivity - High. Confidentiality and integrity of the source code are important to prevent unauthorized modifications and intellectual property theft.
- Build artifacts (packaged library): Sensitivity - Medium. Integrity of the build artifacts is crucial to ensure that developers are using a safe and untampered library.
- Developer credentials and secrets used in the build process: Sensitivity - High. Confidentiality of these credentials is vital to prevent unauthorized access to the build and publishing pipeline.

Data sensitivity classification:
- Source code: Confidential, Integrity-sensitive.
- Build artifacts: Integrity-sensitive.
- Developer credentials/secrets: Confidential, Integrity-sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended scope and complexity of color manipulations that the library aims to support?
- Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints for the library?
- Is there a plan for long-term maintenance and support of the library, including security updates?
- Are there any specific types of applications or industries that are the primary target users of this library?
- Are there any external dependencies that the library relies on, or is it designed to be dependency-free?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a useful and reliable open-source library for the Swift developer community. Adoption and positive community feedback are key success metrics.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important, but not the absolute highest priority for an open-source utility library. Focus should be on preventing common vulnerabilities and ensuring basic security hygiene. The library is assumed to be used in a variety of applications with varying security requirements, so it should be robust against common input-related vulnerabilities.
- DESIGN: The library is designed to be lightweight and modular, focusing on core color manipulation functionalities. It is intended to be distributed via Swift Package Manager and integrated into standard Swift development workflows. The build process is assumed to be automated using GitHub Actions or a similar CI/CD system.
