# Threat Model Analysis for vicc/chameleon

## Threat: [Command Injection](./threats/command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is processed by the application and then executed as a system command by Chameleon. This is achieved by injecting shell commands into user-provided input or by manipulating application logic that constructs commands for Chameleon based on user input. Chameleon's command execution functionality then executes these injected commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to run any command they choose.
    *   Complete server compromise, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.
*   **Chameleon Component Affected:**
    *   `Command` class and its execution methods (e.g., `run`, `execute`).
    *   Input parsing and argument handling within Chameleon when directly exposed to unsanitized user input by the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into commands executed by Chameleon. Employ allow-lists for expected input values and rigorously escape special characters that could be interpreted as command separators or operators.
    *   **Parameterization (if applicable):** Utilize parameterized commands or command builders provided by the underlying execution environment whenever possible to separate commands from user-supplied data.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that Chameleon commands are executed with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running commands as root or with elevated privileges.
    *   **Command Whitelisting:** Implement a strict whitelist of allowed commands and their permissible arguments. Only execute commands that explicitly match this predefined whitelist.
    *   **Comprehensive Code Review:** Conduct in-depth code reviews to proactively identify and remediate potential command injection vulnerabilities in the application's integration with Chameleon.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Verbose Output and Errors](./threats/information_disclosure_through_verbose_output_and_errors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits the application's handling of command output and error messages generated by Chameleon. The application might unintentionally expose sensitive information contained within command outputs or error logs to unauthorized users or store them insecurely. This leaked information could include system paths, configuration details, or internal application logic revealed through Chameleon's interaction with the system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data such as credentials, API keys, internal file paths, and configuration details present in command outputs or error messages.
    *   Revelation of application vulnerabilities through error messages, providing attackers with valuable information for further exploitation.
    *   Information gathering for reconnaissance purposes, enabling attackers to gain a deeper understanding of the system and plan more targeted attacks.
*   **Chameleon Component Affected:**
    *   Output streams (`stdout`, `stderr`) returned by Chameleon's command execution methods.
    *   Error handling mechanisms within Chameleon and the application's integration that manage and present error information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Sanitization and Filtering:** Sanitize and filter command outputs before displaying them to users or logging them. Remove or redact any sensitive information that might be present in the output.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling to prevent the direct display of verbose error messages to users. Log errors securely and separately for debugging purposes, ensuring sensitive details are not exposed to end-users.
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Ensure that logs containing command outputs and errors are stored securely with restricted access limited to authorized personnel only.
    *   **Minimize Output Verbosity:** Configure commands to generate only the minimal output necessary for the application's intended functionality. Avoid using unnecessary verbose modes that could increase the risk of information leakage.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends requests that trigger resource-intensive commands via Chameleon. These commands, even if not inherently malicious, are designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) when executed by Chameleon and the underlying operating system. Repeated execution of such commands can lead to server overload, rendering the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application unavailability and extended downtime, disrupting services for legitimate users.
    *   Server instability and performance degradation, impacting the overall user experience.
    *   Disruption of critical services and potential financial losses due to service interruption.
*   **Chameleon Component Affected:**
    *   Command execution mechanisms within Chameleon that interact with the operating system and consume system resources.
    *   Application logic that allows users to trigger command execution through Chameleon without adequate resource management or limitations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting Implementation:** Implement rate limiting on user requests that initiate command execution through Chameleon to restrict the frequency of resource-intensive operations.
    *   **Resource Quota Enforcement:** Set resource quotas (e.g., CPU time limits, memory limits) for commands executed by Chameleon to prevent individual commands from monopolizing server resources.
    *   **Command Execution Timeout:** Configure timeouts for command execution to automatically terminate long-running commands that could potentially exhaust resources indefinitely.
    *   **Input Validation and Complexity Limits:** Validate user inputs to prevent the execution of excessively complex or resource-intensive commands. Implement limits on command complexity and resource usage.
    *   **Asynchronous/Background Execution:** If appropriate for the application's workflow, execute commands asynchronously or in the background to prevent blocking the main application thread and maintain responsiveness under load.
