# Threat Model Analysis for vicc/chameleon

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via User-Provided Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_user-provided_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious script code within user-controlled content that is then rendered by Chameleon. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization or escaping within Chameleon's rendering logic. When other users view this content, the injected script executes in their browsers. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Impact:** High - Could lead to account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Markdown rendering module, HTML rendering module (depending on the input format and how Chameleon handles it). Specifically, the functions responsible for converting the input format to HTML for display without proper escaping.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Utilize Chameleon's built-in sanitization features if available and configure them securely.
- Employ output encoding (HTML escaping) on the rendered content *within the application code that uses Chameleon* before sending it to the browser, ensuring that script tags are treated as text. While Chameleon should ideally handle this, the application has the final responsibility.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through Maliciously Crafted Links or Includes](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__through_maliciously_crafted_links_or_includes.md)

**Description:** If Chameleon's design or implementation allows rendering content that includes external resources (e.g., images in Markdown, external templates) without proper validation, an attacker could craft content that forces the server to make requests to internal or external resources. This is a direct vulnerability within Chameleon's resource handling.

**Impact:** High - Could lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data breaches, or denial of service against internal services.

**Affected Component:** Markdown rendering module (for image links), potentially template inclusion mechanisms *within Chameleon*. The functions responsible for resolving and fetching external resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Disable or restrict the ability to include external resources *within Chameleon's configuration* if not strictly necessary.
- If external resources are required, implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains or protocols *within the application's configuration of Chameleon or by pre-processing URLs before passing them to Chameleon*.
- Sanitize and validate URLs used for including external content *before they reach Chameleon*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion through Complex or Malicious Input](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion_through_complex_or_malicious_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides extremely large, deeply nested, or otherwise computationally expensive input directly to Chameleon's rendering functions. This exploits inefficiencies or vulnerabilities within Chameleon's parsing or rendering engine, leading to excessive CPU, memory, or other resource consumption, causing a denial of service.

**Impact:** Medium - Could make the application temporarily unavailable or unresponsive.

**Affected Component:** Markdown parsing module, HTML parsing module, core rendering engine *within Chameleon*. The functions responsible for parsing and processing the input content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement input size limits and complexity restrictions on content *before* passing it to Chameleon.
- Configure timeouts for rendering operations *within the application's usage of Chameleon* to prevent indefinite processing.
- Consider using a separate process or container for rendering untrusted content using Chameleon to isolate resource consumption.
