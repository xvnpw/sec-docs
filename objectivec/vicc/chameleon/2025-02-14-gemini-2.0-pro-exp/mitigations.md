# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vicc/chameleon

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify and Configure Auto-Escaping](./mitigation_strategies/verify_and_configure_auto-escaping.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Documentation Review:** Thoroughly review the `chameleon` documentation to understand its auto-escaping mechanisms and configuration options. Identify the specific functions or settings that control escaping.
2.  **Enable Auto-Escaping:** Ensure that auto-escaping is explicitly enabled in your `chameleon` configuration.  Do not rely on default settings without verifying them.
3.  **Context-Specific Escaping:** Confirm that `chameleon` is configured to use the correct escaping mode for the output format (e.g., HTML, XML).  Different contexts require different escaping rules.
4.  **Testing:** Create test cases that deliberately include potentially dangerous characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) in template data.  Verify that these characters are correctly escaped in the rendered output.  Include common XSS payloads in your tests.
5.  **Manual Escaping (if needed):** If `chameleon`'s auto-escaping is insufficient for a particular context, or if you have any doubts, use `chameleon`'s provided escaping functions *explicitly* in your code to escape data before passing it to the template.  The documentation should detail these functions.
6. **Consider a Wrapper:** If you find yourself frequently needing to manually escape, consider creating a wrapper function or class around `chameleon`'s rendering methods to automatically apply the necessary escaping.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Prevents injection of malicious JavaScript code through template data by ensuring proper escaping.
    *   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** (Severity: Critical) - While not the primary defense, correct escaping can help mitigate some SSTI attacks that rely on injecting special characters.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **SSTI:** Provides a secondary layer of defense.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Auto-escaping is believed to be enabled (needs verification).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough testing with XSS payloads is needed.
    *   Documentation of the specific `chameleon` configuration related to escaping is required.
    *   A wrapper function might be beneficial for consistent escaping.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Configure Chameleon's Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_configure_chameleon's_error_handling.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Documentation Review:** Examine `chameleon`'s documentation for any settings or options related to error reporting, debugging, and exception handling.
2.  **Disable Verbose Errors:** Identify and disable any settings that might cause `chameleon` to output detailed error messages, stack traces, or template code snippets in the rendered output.  This is crucial for production environments.
3.  **Custom Error Handling (Integration):** Integrate `chameleon`'s error handling with your application's overall error handling mechanism.  Catch any exceptions raised by `chameleon` during template rendering and handle them gracefully.
4. **Log, Don't Display:** Ensure that detailed error information is logged to a secure location (file or logging service) for debugging purposes, but *never* displayed to the user.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: High) - Prevents sensitive information (file paths, template code, internal variables) from being leaked through error messages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   General error handling is in place, but `chameleon`-specific error handling needs review.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Specific review of `chameleon`'s error handling configuration and integration with the application's error handling is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Template Language Features (If Possible and Necessary)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_template_language_features__if_possible_and_necessary_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Documentation Review:** Examine the `chameleon` documentation to determine if it offers any mechanisms to restrict the features of the templating language itself. Some templating engines allow you to disable certain features (e.g., dynamic code execution, template inclusion) to reduce the attack surface.
2. **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If `chameleon` provides such options, disable any features that are not strictly required by your application. This limits the potential for attackers to exploit more powerful (and potentially dangerous) features.
3. **Custom Parser/Compiler (Extreme):** In very high-security environments, if `chameleon` doesn't offer sufficient built-in restrictions, you might consider creating a custom parser or compiler for a *subset* of the `chameleon` language, enforcing stricter rules. This is a complex and resource-intensive approach.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** (Severity: Critical) - Reduces the attack surface by limiting the capabilities of the templating language.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Can prevent the use of complex template features that could lead to resource exhaustion.

* **Impact:**
    * **SSTI:** Risk reduced (depending on the restrictions implemented).
    * **DoS:** Risk potentially reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Not implemented.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Requires investigation into `chameleon`'s capabilities and potentially significant development effort.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Recursive Includes (If Chameleon Supports Inclusion)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_recursive_includes__if_chameleon_supports_inclusion_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Documentation Review:** Check if `chameleon` supports template inclusion (one template including another).
    2. **Avoid Recursion:** If inclusion is supported, *strictly avoid* any recursive inclusion patterns, where a template includes itself (directly or indirectly).
    3. **Code Review:** During code reviews, specifically check for any potential recursive inclusion scenarios.
    4. **Static Analysis (If Possible):** If tools are available, use static analysis to detect potential recursive inclusion patterns in your templates.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
     * **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents infinite loops caused by recursive template inclusion, which can lead to resource exhaustion.

* **Impact:**
    * **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced (related to recursive inclusion).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Not explicitly checked, needs to be verified if `chameleon` supports inclusion.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Requires review of template structure and potentially static analysis if inclusion is used.
