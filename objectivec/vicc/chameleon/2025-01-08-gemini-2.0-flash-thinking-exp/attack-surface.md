# Attack Surface Analysis for vicc/chameleon

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Data Binding](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_data_binding.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into the application's data and executed in users' browsers when the data is rendered.
    *   **How Chameleon Contributes:** If Chameleon's data binding mechanism doesn't automatically escape or sanitize data before rendering it in the DOM, it becomes vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    *   **Example:** A user comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` is fetched and displayed using Chameleon's data binding without sanitization, causing the script to execute in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Chameleon's built-in sanitization features (if available) for data binding.
        *   Implement manual output encoding/escaping of user-provided data before binding it to the template.

## Attack Surface: [Shadow DOM Manipulation leading to XSS](./attack_surfaces/shadow_dom_manipulation_leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts or styles into the Shadow DOM of Chameleon components, potentially bypassing standard XSS defenses.
    *   **How Chameleon Contributes:** If Chameleon doesn't adequately control or sanitize content rendered within the Shadow DOM of its components, it can become a vector for XSS.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a Chameleon component allows an attacker to inject a malicious `<style>` tag into its Shadow DOM, which then exfiltrates user data.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, manipulation of the component's appearance or behavior, potentially leading to further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Chameleon components properly sanitize any dynamic content rendered within their Shadow DOM.
        *   Avoid directly manipulating the Shadow DOM with user-provided data without careful sanitization.
        *   Regularly review and update Chameleon components to patch potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Route Handling and Client-Side Routing Bypass](./attack_surfaces/insecure_route_handling_and_client-side_routing_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate client-side routes to access unauthorized parts of the application or trigger unintended behavior.
    *   **How Chameleon Contributes:** If the application relies solely on Chameleon's client-side routing for security without server-side verification, it can be bypassed. Vulnerabilities in Chameleon's routing logic could also be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker directly navigates to a route intended for administrators by manually changing the URL, bypassing client-side checks implemented by Chameleon.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive information, unauthorized actions, bypass of access controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement server-side authorization checks for all sensitive routes and actions.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side routing for security.
        *   Ensure Chameleon's routing configuration is secure and doesn't expose unintended routes.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Element Definition Hijacking](./attack_surfaces/custom_element_definition_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers register malicious custom elements with the same names as intended Chameleon components, overriding their functionality.
    *   **How Chameleon Contributes:** If the application allows dynamic registration of custom elements or if Chameleon's registration process has vulnerabilities, attackers could register malicious components.
    *   **Example:** An attacker registers a custom element with the same name as a core Chameleon component, but with malicious JavaScript that steals user credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the affected component's functionality, potentially leading to data theft or other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic registration of custom elements with user-provided names.
        *   Ensure Chameleon's component registration process is secure and prevents overriding.
        *   Implement checks to verify the integrity and source of registered custom elements.

## Attack Surface: [Attribute/Property Injection in Components](./attack_surfaces/attributeproperty_injection_in_components.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious values into the attributes or properties of Chameleon components, leading to unexpected behavior or script execution.
    *   **How Chameleon Contributes:** If Chameleon components directly use user-provided data to set attributes or properties without sanitization, they become vulnerable to injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** A Chameleon component uses a user-provided URL to set the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag without validation, allowing an attacker to inject a `javascript:` URL.
    *   **Impact:** XSS, redirection to malicious sites, manipulation of component behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all user-provided data before setting component attributes or properties.
        *   Use secure coding practices when handling dynamic attributes and properties within Chameleon components.
