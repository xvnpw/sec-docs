## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploiting Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities**
* **Attack Vector:** Template Injection (Critical Node)
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into template data that is processed by Chameleon's templating engine on the server-side.
    * **Mechanism:** User-provided input, if not properly sanitized, is embedded directly into the template. The templating engine then interprets this malicious code during rendering, leading to server-side execution.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, installation of malware.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** High impact due to potential for RCE, moderately likely if input sanitization is insufficient.

    * **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Code in Template Data
        * **Description:** This is the specific technique used within the Template Injection attack.
        * **Mechanism:** Crafting malicious input strings that leverage the syntax and capabilities of the templating engine to execute arbitrary commands or code.
        * **Potential Impact:** Same as Template Injection.
        * **Why it's High-Risk:** Direct execution of malicious code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Client-Side Hydration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_client-side_hydration_vulnerabilities.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploiting Client-Side Hydration Vulnerabilities**
* **Attack Vector:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Hydration (Critical Node)
    * **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into the server-rendered HTML and subsequently executed in the user's browser during the client-side hydration process performed by Chameleon.
    * **Mechanism:** The server fails to properly sanitize user-provided data before rendering it into the HTML. This unsanitized data contains malicious JavaScript code. When Chameleon hydrates the client-side DOM, the browser executes this injected script.
    * **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, client-side data theft, keylogging.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** Common vulnerability, relatively easy to exploit, significant impact on users.

    * **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Payloads via Server-Rendered Output
        * **Description:** The specific method of injecting the malicious scripts that lead to XSS during hydration.
        * **Mechanism:** Embedding JavaScript code within HTML tags, attributes, or script blocks that are generated by the server-side rendering process.
        * **Potential Impact:** Same as XSS via Insecure Hydration.
        * **Why it's High-Risk:** Direct injection of client-side executable code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Chameleon](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_chameleon.md)

**High-Risk Path: Dependency Vulnerabilities in Chameleon (Critical Node)**
* **Attack Vector:** Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Chameleon's Dependencies
    * **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries that Chameleon relies upon.
    * **Mechanism:** Identifying and leveraging Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in Chameleon's dependencies. This often involves using existing exploit code or crafting specific requests to trigger the vulnerability.
    * **Potential Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. Can range from Remote Code Execution to Denial of Service or information disclosure.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** Dependencies are a common attack vector, and vulnerabilities can be widespread. The impact can be severe depending on the compromised dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if Chameleon serializes/deserializes data)](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_chameleon_serializesdeserializes_data_.md)

**High-Risk Path: Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if Chameleon serializes/deserializes data)**
* **Attack Vector:** Inject Malicious Serialized Data
    * **Description:** If Chameleon serializes data on the server-side (e.g., for passing state to the client), an attacker injects maliciously crafted serialized data. When this data is deserialized, it can lead to code execution.
    * **Mechanism:** Exploiting weaknesses in the deserialization process where the application blindly trusts the incoming data. Maliciously crafted objects, when deserialized, can trigger arbitrary code execution.
    * **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the server.
    * **Why it's High-Risk:** Direct path to RCE, although it often requires more specialized knowledge and is dependent on Chameleon's implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Chameleon Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_chameleon_exploitation.md)

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application via Chameleon Exploitation**
    * **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of Chameleon vulnerabilities.
    * **Why it's Critical:** Represents the overall security failure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Template Injection](./attack_tree_paths/template_injection.md)

* **Template Injection**
    * **Description:** As described above, a direct path to server-side code execution.
    * **Why it's Critical:** High impact and a common vulnerability in web applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Hydration](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_insecure_hydration.md)

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Hydration**
    * **Description:** As described above, a common and impactful client-side vulnerability.
    * **Why it's Critical:** High likelihood and significant impact on users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Chameleon](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_chameleon.md)

* **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Chameleon**
    * **Description:** Represents the risk introduced by external libraries.
    * **Why it's Critical:** A significant attack surface that is not directly controlled by the application developers.
