# Threat Model Analysis for grouper/flatuikit

## Threat: [Threat 1: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious `flatuikit.js` (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/threat_1_arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious__flatuikit_js___supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `flatuikit` repository (GitHub, npm, etc.) or a CDN serving `flatuikit.js`.  They inject malicious JavaScript code into the library. When a user loads the application, the malicious code executes in their browser, giving the attacker full control.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the user's session and potentially the application.
        *   Theft of sensitive data (cookies, tokens, form data, PII).
        *   Redirection to phishing sites or malware distribution.
        *   Defacement of the application.
        *   Potential for lateral movement within the user's network (if browser exploits are used).
    *   **Affected Component:** `flatuikit.js` (the core JavaScript file, or any JavaScript modules within the library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Mandatory. Use SRI tags when including `flatuikit.js` from a CDN.  This ensures the browser only executes the file if it matches a known, trusted hash.  Generate new hashes whenever `flatuikit.js` is updated.
        *   **Pin Dependency Version:**  Specify a precise, *audited* version of `flatuikit` in your project's dependencies (e.g., `package.json`).  Do *not* use `latest` or wildcard versions.  Regularly review and update this pinned version after thorough testing.
        *   **Regular Dependency Audits:**  Use tools like `npm audit` (or equivalent) to *automatically* check for known vulnerabilities in `flatuikit` and *all* of its dependencies (transitive dependencies).  Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP with a `script-src` directive that *only* allows scripts from trusted sources (your domain and the specific CDN hosting the *verified* `flatuikit.js`, using the `sha256-` or `sha384-` hash from the SRI tag).  Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`.
        *   **Vendor the Library (with extreme caution):**  If using a CDN is not possible, copy the *audited* `flatuikit.js` file directly into your project's repository.  This gives you full control, but requires *manual* updates and rigorous security audits.  This is generally less recommended than SRI + CDN.

## Threat: [Threat 2: DOM-based XSS in `flatuikit` JavaScript Components (e.g., `flatuikit.tabs.js`, `flatuikit.dialog.js`)](./threats/threat_2_dom-based_xss_in__flatuikit__javascript_components__e_g____flatuikit_tabs_js____flatuikit_d_fdd285e0.md)

*   **Description:** A `flatuikit` JavaScript component (e.g., one that handles tabs, dialogs, tooltips, or any dynamic UI element) has a vulnerability where it doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied data or data from external sources before inserting it into the DOM. An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., a tab label, a tooltip message) containing JavaScript code that executes when the component renders.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS).
        *   Data theft (cookies, tokens, form data).
        *   Session hijacking.
        *   Redirection to malicious sites.
        *   Defacement.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any `flatuikit` JavaScript component that dynamically manipulates the DOM based on user input or external data. Examples (hypothetical): `flatuikit.tabs.js`, `flatuikit.dialog.js`, `flatuikit.tooltip.js`, `flatuikit.autocomplete.js`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding (Mandatory):**  Before inserting *any* data into the DOM (especially data from user input or external sources), *always* sanitize it to remove potentially dangerous characters and then encode it appropriately for the context (HTML encoding, attribute encoding, JavaScript encoding, as needed). Use a well-tested and actively maintained library like DOMPurify.  *Never* rely on custom regular expressions.
        *   **Avoid `innerHTML` Where Possible:**  Prefer using safer DOM manipulation methods like `textContent`, `createElement`, and `setAttribute` instead of directly setting `innerHTML`.  If `innerHTML` *must* be used, ensure the input is *thoroughly* sanitized first.
        *   **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Regularly review the code of *all* `flatuikit` JavaScript components for potential DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.  Use static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint with security plugins) to automatically detect potential issues.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS, even if a vulnerability exists.  Use `script-src` carefully, and consider using a nonce or hash-based approach to allow only specific inline scripts.
        * **Minimize use of vulnerable components:** If a component is known or suspected to be vulnerable, and a secure alternative exists (either within `flatuikit` or a different library), use the alternative.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Vulnerability in Deprecated `flatuikit` Components](./threats/threat_3_vulnerability_in_deprecated__flatuikit__components.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses a deprecated `flatuikit` component (e.g., `flatuikit.old-component.js`) that is no longer maintained and contains a known, unpatched, and exploitable vulnerability (e.g., a cross-site scripting flaw or a denial-of-service vulnerability).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exploitation of the known vulnerability, leading to XSS, data theft, denial of service, or other consequences depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any deprecated `flatuikit` component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Remove Deprecated Components (Mandatory):** The *only* truly effective mitigation is to *completely remove* any deprecated components from your application.  Replace them with supported alternatives, either from a newer version of `flatuikit` or from a different library.
        *   **Upgrade to a Newer Version (if applicable):** If a newer version of `flatuikit` exists that removes the deprecated component or provides a secure replacement, upgrade to that version *after thorough testing*.
        *   **Manual Patching (Absolutely Last Resort):**  *Never* attempt to manually patch a deprecated component unless you have deep security expertise and understand the full implications.  This is extremely risky and almost always the wrong approach.
