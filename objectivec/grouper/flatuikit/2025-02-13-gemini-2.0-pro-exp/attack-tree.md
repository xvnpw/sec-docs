## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Authentication [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_authentication__hr_.md)

*   **Description:**  This is the overarching branch focused on gaining unauthorized access by compromising the authentication process.  It's high-risk because authentication is the primary gatekeeper to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit `flatuikit` Authentication Logic [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit__flatuikit__authentication_logic__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch targets vulnerabilities specifically within `flatuikit`'s authentication-related code or its configuration.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - `flatuikit` likely relies on established libraries like Flask-Login, but custom extensions or misconfigurations could introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation leads to account takeover.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High - Requires understanding of `flatuikit`'s authentication flow and potentially reverse-engineering custom code.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Failed login attempts might be logged, but sophisticated attacks could be stealthy.

*   **Description:**  This involves circumventing the login process entirely, potentially by exploiting weaknesses in how `flatuikit` (or the application using it) manages sessions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low - Relies on significant flaws in session handling, which are less common in well-established libraries.
        *   **Impact:** Very High - Direct access without credentials.
        *   **Effort:** High - Requires in-depth knowledge of session management and potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Successful bypass may not leave obvious traces in logs.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
