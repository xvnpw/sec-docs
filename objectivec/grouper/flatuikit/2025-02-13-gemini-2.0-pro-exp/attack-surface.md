# Attack Surface Analysis for grouper/flatuikit

## Attack Surface: [1. Unvalidated Form Input (Beyond Basic HTML5)](./attack_surfaces/1__unvalidated_form_input__beyond_basic_html5_.md)

*   **Description:**  Insufficient validation and sanitization of data submitted through `flatuikit` form components (text fields, selects, checkboxes, etc.) *beyond* what standard HTML5 validation provides.  This focuses on `flatuikit`'s *own* handling of input, *not* the application's backend.
*   **How `flatuikit` Contributes:** `flatuikit` provides the form components. If it doesn't perform robust *internal* validation (even before data reaches the server) *or* if it has flaws in its client-side validation that can be bypassed, it directly contributes to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  `flatuikit`'s text input component has a client-side length restriction, but an attacker modifies the JavaScript to bypass this restriction and submits an excessively long string.  If `flatuikit` doesn't have *any* server-side validation (or relies on developers to implement it all), this bypass is successful.  Or, `flatuikit`'s own sanitization logic is flawed, allowing some malicious characters through.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially allows for attacks that bypass initial client-side defenses, making server-side vulnerabilities easier to exploit (e.g., Stored XSS, SQL Injection, command injection).  Can also lead to client-side issues if `flatuikit` itself uses the unsanitized input internally.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **High** (because it weakens the first line of defense and can facilitate other attacks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Assume `flatuikit`'s internal validation is *not* sufficient.  Implement *strict* server-side validation and sanitization for *all* data received from *any* `flatuikit` component.  Never trust *any* client-side validation, even from a trusted library.  Review `flatuikit`'s source code to understand its validation mechanisms and identify potential weaknesses.
    *   **Users:** (No direct user mitigation).

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious File Uploads (If `flatuikit` has File Upload Components)](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_file_uploads__if__flatuikit__has_file_upload_components_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, executables) through `flatuikit` file upload components.  This focuses on `flatuikit`'s *own* handling of file uploads.
*   **How `flatuikit` Contributes:**  `flatuikit` provides the file upload component. If it doesn't perform *any* server-side validation of file types, sizes, or contents, or if its client-side restrictions are easily bypassed, it directly enables this attack.
*   **Example:**  `flatuikit`'s file upload component only checks the file extension on the client-side.  An attacker renames a PHP web shell to `.jpg` and uploads it.  If `flatuikit` doesn't perform *any* server-side checks (or relies entirely on the developer to implement them), the upload succeeds.
*   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data theft, data destruction (if the server executes the uploaded file).
*   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Assume `flatuikit`'s file upload handling is *insecure*. Implement *rigorous* server-side file upload validation, as described in the previous, more comprehensive list.  *Never* rely on client-side checks alone, and *never* assume `flatuikit` handles security adequately. Review `flatuikit`'s source code to understand how it handles file uploads.
    *   **Users:** (No direct user mitigation).

## Attack Surface: [3. XSS via Rich Text Editors (If `flatuikit` Integrates One)](./attack_surfaces/3__xss_via_rich_text_editors__if__flatuikit__integrates_one_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious JavaScript through a rich text editor provided or integrated by `flatuikit`. This focuses on `flatuikit`'s *own* sanitization (or lack thereof).
*   **How `flatuikit` Contributes:**  `flatuikit` either provides the rich text editor or handles its integration. If its *own* sanitization logic (before data reaches the server) is flawed or absent, it directly enables XSS.
*   **Example:**  `flatuikit` integrates a rich text editor but doesn't perform *any* server-side sanitization, relying solely on the editor's built-in (and potentially bypassable) client-side sanitization.  An attacker crafts a malicious payload that bypasses the client-side checks.
*   **Impact:**  Session hijacking, data theft, defacement, phishing.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**  Assume `flatuikit`'s sanitization is *insufficient*. Implement *robust* server-side HTML sanitization using a library like DOMPurify.  *Never* rely on client-side sanitization alone, even from a trusted library or editor.  Review `flatuikit`'s source code to understand how it handles rich text input and sanitization.
    *   **Users:** (No direct user mitigation).

## Attack Surface: [4. Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/4__vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `flatuikit` relies on other JavaScript libraries (dependencies) that may have known vulnerabilities.
*   **How `flatuikit` Contributes:** `flatuikit`'s `package.json` (or equivalent) file lists its dependencies. These dependencies are directly included because of `flatuikit`.
*   **Example:** `flatuikit` uses an outdated version of a JavaScript library with a known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through the application *because* `flatuikit` included the vulnerable library.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from XSS to RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High** (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly audit `flatuikit`'s dependencies using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or `snyk`.
        *   Keep all of `flatuikit`'s dependencies up-to-date.
        *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.
        *   Consider forking `flatuikit` and patching dependencies directly (if necessary and if upstream is unresponsive).
        *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit script sources (this mitigates *some* dependency issues, but is not a complete solution).
    *   **Users:** (No direct user mitigation).

## Attack Surface: [5. Component-Specific Logic Flaws (High-Impact Only)](./attack_surfaces/5__component-specific_logic_flaws__high-impact_only_.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs in the internal logic of specific `flatuikit` components that lead to *significant* security vulnerabilities.
*   **How `flatuikit` Contributes:** The component's code itself, as written by the `flatuikit` developers, is the direct source of the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A custom authentication-related component in `flatuikit` (e.g., a password reset component) has a flaw that allows attackers to bypass authentication or reset other users' passwords. Or, a component designed to display sensitive data leaks that data due to a logic error.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the specific flaw, but *must* be high-impact to be included here (e.g., authentication bypass, data leakage of sensitive information, ability to execute arbitrary code).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (by definition, since we're filtering for high-impact flaws).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly review the source code of *all* `flatuikit` components used, *especially* those handling sensitive data or authentication.
        *   Perform penetration testing focused specifically on the functionality of these components.
        *   Fuzz test components with a wide range of inputs.
        *   Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all components.
        *   If a critical flaw is found, report it to the `flatuikit` maintainers immediately. Consider forking and patching if the upstream is unresponsive.
    *   **Users:** (No direct user mitigation).
