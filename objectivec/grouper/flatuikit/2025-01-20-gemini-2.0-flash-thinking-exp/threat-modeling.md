# Threat Model Analysis for grouper/flatuikit

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through vulnerable modal components.](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__through_vulnerable_modal_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL or inject data into the application that, when rendered by a Flat UI Kit modal component, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. This might involve manipulating parameters that control the modal's content or attributes.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application.

**Affected Component:** `modal.js` (JavaScript module responsible for modal functionality), potentially the HTML structure and CSS styling related to modals.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize all user-provided data before displaying it within modal content.
* Avoid directly rendering user input as HTML within modals.
* Use secure coding practices to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
* Keep Flat UI Kit updated to the latest version with security patches.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through vulnerable tooltip or popover components.](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__through_vulnerable_tooltip_or_popover_components.md)

**Description:** Similar to the modal vulnerability, an attacker could inject malicious scripts through data used to populate tooltips or popovers. This could involve manipulating the `title` attribute or other data attributes used by these components. When the tooltip/popover is triggered, the script executes.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application.

**Affected Component:** `tooltip.js`, `popover.js` (JavaScript modules), and related HTML and CSS.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize all data used to populate tooltips and popovers.
* Avoid rendering unsanitized user input directly within these components.
* Keep Flat UI Kit updated.
* Implement CSP.

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection via vulnerable components.](./threats/client-side_template_injection_via_vulnerable_components.md)

**Description:** If the application uses a client-side templating engine in conjunction with Flat UI Kit components, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code into the templates used by these components. This could happen if data passed to the templating engine is not properly sanitized or escaped. The injected code would then be executed in the user's browser when the component is rendered.

**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application.

**Affected Component:** Potentially any component that dynamically renders content based on data, especially those relying on JavaScript for rendering (e.g., dynamic lists, data tables if implemented with Flat UI Kit components).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure templating practices and ensure proper escaping of data within templates.
* Avoid directly embedding user input into templates without sanitization.
* Regularly review and audit the client-side templating logic.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the underlying Bootstrap library.](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_underlying_bootstrap_library.md)

**Description:** Flat UI Kit is built on top of Bootstrap. Any security vulnerabilities present in the specific version of Bootstrap used by Flat UI Kit will inherently affect applications using it. Attackers could exploit these known Bootstrap vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific Bootstrap vulnerability. Could include XSS, denial of service, or other client-side exploits.

**Affected Component:** Underlying Bootstrap JavaScript, CSS, or other assets used by Flat UI Kit components.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific Bootstrap vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Flat UI Kit updated to versions that incorporate the latest secure versions of Bootstrap.
* Monitor security advisories for Bootstrap and Flat UI Kit.
* If a vulnerability is identified in the used Bootstrap version, consider patching or upgrading even if Flat UI Kit hasn't released an update yet (if feasible).
