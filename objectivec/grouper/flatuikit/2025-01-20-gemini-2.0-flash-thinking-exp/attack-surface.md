# Attack Surface Analysis for grouper/flatuikit

## Attack Surface: [Attack Surface 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input in JavaScript Components](./attack_surfaces/attack_surface_1_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_input_in_javascript_components.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **How Flat UI Kit Contributes:** If Flat UI Kit's JavaScript components (e.g., modals, alerts, custom widgets) render user-provided data without proper sanitization or output encoding, it creates an entry point for XSS attacks. For instance, if a component displays a user-defined title or message directly into the HTML.
*   **Example:** A Flat UI Kit modal component is used to display a message fetched from user input. An attacker crafts a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When the modal renders this message, the script executes in the victim's browser.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict output encoding and sanitization for all user-provided data rendered by Flat UI Kit components. Use browser-provided APIs for safe HTML insertion. Avoid directly injecting raw HTML from user input. Regularly update Flat UI Kit to benefit from potential security patches. Review the source code of custom components built on top of Flat UI Kit for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Attack Surface 2: Supply Chain Compromise](./attack_surfaces/attack_surface_2_supply_chain_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The Flat UI Kit library itself is compromised at its source or during distribution.
*   **How Flat UI Kit Contributes:** If the official repository, CDN, or download source for Flat UI Kit is compromised, malicious code could be injected into the library files. Applications using this compromised version would then be vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Flat UI Kit repository and injects malicious JavaScript into the core library files. Developers downloading this compromised version unknowingly include the malicious code in their applications.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of applications using the compromised library, potentially leading to data breaches, malware distribution, or other severe consequences.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Download Flat UI Kit from trusted and official sources. Verify the integrity of downloaded files using checksums or digital signatures if available. Be cautious about using unofficial or third-party distributions of the library. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to detect known vulnerabilities and potential supply chain risks.
