## Attack Tree Path: [CSS Injection [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/css_injection__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Exploiting lack of input sanitization in areas where users can influence styling (e.g., custom themes, user profile settings with style options).
*   Injecting malicious CSS code that can:
    *   Exfiltrate data by manipulating CSS selectors and using `url()` with data URIs or external resources to send data to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   Perform UI redressing or clickjacking by using CSS positioning and opacity to overlay malicious elements on legitimate UI components, tricking users into performing unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious CSS through User-Controlled Input [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_css_through_user-controlled_input__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Identifying input fields or functionalities that allow users to provide styling information.
*   Crafting malicious CSS code containing exfiltration techniques or UI manipulation tactics.
*   Submitting this malicious CSS through the vulnerable input fields.
*   The application rendering this unsanitized CSS, leading to the execution of the attacker's malicious code in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Theme Tampering (If Application Allows Custom Themes) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/theme_tampering__if_application_allows_custom_themes___high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Upload Malicious Theme Files:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the theme upload or management functionality.
    *   Uploading a theme file containing malicious CSS, JavaScript, or other harmful content.
    *   This malicious content can then be executed when the tampered theme is activated, potentially leading to full application compromise.
*   **Modify Existing Theme Files (If Accessible):**
    *   Exploiting insecure file permissions or access controls on the server where theme files are stored.
    *   Directly modifying existing theme files to inject malicious CSS or JavaScript.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JavaScript Component Vulnerabilities (Focus on Flat UI Kit's JS) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_javascript_component_vulnerabilities__focus_on_flat_ui_kit's_js___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Input Handling Flaws in Widgets:**
    *   Identifying vulnerabilities in how Flat UI Kit's JavaScript components (e.g., modals, dropdowns, sliders) handle user-provided input or data attributes.
    *   Injecting malicious scripts through these vulnerable input points.
*   **Event Handler Manipulation:**
    *   Exploiting weaknesses that allow attackers to override or inject malicious event handlers on Flat UI Kit elements.
    *   This can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when users interact with these elements.
*   **DOM Manipulation Issues:**
    *   Injecting scripts that manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in unexpected ways due to Flat UI Kit's structure or how it interacts with the application's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via UI Components [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_ui_components__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Exploiting vulnerabilities within Flat UI Kit's JavaScript components to inject and execute malicious scripts in a user's browser.
*   This can be achieved through various means, including:
    *   Injecting malicious scripts into parameters or data attributes used by UI components.
    *   Manipulating event handlers associated with UI elements.
    *   Exploiting DOM manipulation flaws within the components.
*   Successful XSS can lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's session.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Developer Misuse of Flat UI Kit Components [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_developer_misuse_of_flat_ui_kit_components__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Developers failing to properly sanitize data before passing it to Flat UI Kit components for rendering.
*   This can lead to the injection of malicious scripts that are then executed by the user's browser when the component renders the unsanitized data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Sanitization of Data Passed to or Rendered by Flat UI Kit Components [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/improper_sanitization_of_data_passed_to_or_rendered_by_flat_ui_kit_components__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Identifying points in the application's code where user-provided data is used to populate content within Flat UI Kit components.
*   Crafting malicious scripts that, when included in this data, are not properly escaped or sanitized.
*   The Flat UI Kit component then renders this data, causing the malicious script to execute in the user's browser (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related to Flat UI Kit) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__indirectly_related_to_flat_ui_kit___high_risk_path___critical_no_33f25bee.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Identifying known vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries that Flat UI Kit depends on (e.g., Bootstrap).
*   Leveraging publicly disclosed exploits for these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
*   This can involve various attack techniques depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or other severe consequences.
