# Attack Surface Analysis for grouper/flatuikit

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vulnerable Components](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_vulnerable_components.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into a web application that are then executed by other users' browsers.
    *   **How Flat UI Kit Contributes:** If Flat UI Kit contains vulnerable JavaScript components or widgets, or if the application uses Flat UI Kit components in a way that doesn't properly sanitize user input before rendering it, XSS vulnerabilities can be introduced. Older versions of JavaScript libraries used by Flat UI Kit are more likely to have known XSS flaws.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects `<script>stealCookies();</script>` into a comment field styled with Flat UI Kit. If the application doesn't sanitize this input before displaying it using a Flat UI Kit component, the script will execute in other users' browsers viewing the comment.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update Flat UI Kit to the latest version. Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-supplied data rendered through Flat UI Kit components. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Conduct thorough security testing, including XSS vulnerability scans.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application relies on external libraries that have known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Flat UI Kit Contributes:** Flat UI Kit itself likely depends on other JavaScript libraries (e.g., older versions of jQuery). If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, they can be exploited in the application.
    *   **Example:** Flat UI Kit uses an older version of jQuery with a known XSS vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this jQuery vulnerability through a Flat UI Kit component that utilizes the vulnerable jQuery functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, it could lead to XSS, remote code execution, or other forms of compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update Flat UI Kit and all its dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the libraries used by Flat UI Kit. Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Flat UI Kit and its dependencies to ensure the integrity of the files.
