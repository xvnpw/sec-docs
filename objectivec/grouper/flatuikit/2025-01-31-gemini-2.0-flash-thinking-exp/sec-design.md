# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: Provide a reusable and customizable user interface toolkit for web developers.
  - Priority: Ease of integration, visual appeal, and consistent design language across web applications.
  - Priority: Speed up web application development by providing pre-built UI components.
- Business Risks:
  - Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the UI toolkit could be inherited by applications using it, leading to potential exploits and data breaches in those applications.
  - Business Risk: Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates could lead to the toolkit becoming outdated and incompatible with modern web technologies, reducing its usability and adoption.
  - Business Risk: Poor quality or lack of documentation could hinder adoption and increase development time for users.
  - Business Risk: Dependency on external libraries (like Bootstrap and jQuery) introduces supply chain risks if those dependencies have vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Uses package managers (like npm) for managing dependencies, which can facilitate updates and vulnerability patching of dependencies. Implemented in: `package.json` file in the repository.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Client-Side Security - Security is primarily the responsibility of the applications that integrate and use this UI toolkit. The toolkit itself provides UI components and does not enforce specific security measures.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Potential vulnerabilities in underlying dependencies like Bootstrap and jQuery are accepted risks, relying on the maintainers of those projects to address security issues.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in the toolkit's dependencies (Bootstrap, jQuery, etc.) during development and build processes.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools to scan the JavaScript and potentially CSS code for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection flaws) within the toolkit itself.
  - security control: Security Guidelines for Users - Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for developers using the toolkit to build secure applications, especially regarding input validation and handling of user data within UI components.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits or code reviews of the toolkit, especially before major releases, to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Authentication is not directly within the scope of a UI toolkit. Applications using this toolkit will be responsible for implementing their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization is not directly within the scope of a UI toolkit. Applications using this toolkit will be responsible for implementing their own authorization mechanisms based on their specific needs.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: While the UI toolkit provides components for user input, input validation must be implemented by the applications using the toolkit. The toolkit should not introduce vulnerabilities due to improper handling of input within its own code.
    - Requirement: Provide guidance to developers on how to properly validate user inputs when using the toolkit's components in their applications.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for a UI toolkit. If cryptographic operations are needed within applications using this toolkit, they should be implemented by the application developers using secure cryptographic libraries and best practices, outside of the toolkit itself.
