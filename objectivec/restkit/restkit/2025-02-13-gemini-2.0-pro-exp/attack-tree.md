# Attack Tree Analysis for restkit/restkit

Objective: To gain unauthorized access to data or functionality exposed by the application's REST API, leveraging vulnerabilities or misconfigurations specific to the RestKit framework. This could include data exfiltration, unauthorized data modification, or denial of service specifically targeting RestKit components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Object Mapping Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_object_mapping_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Type Confusion [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in RestKit's object mapping configuration to inject unexpected data types, leading to type confusion and potentially arbitrary code execution or data corruption. This is particularly relevant when custom transformers or value transformations are used, or when the mapping is overly permissive.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strictly define expected data types in object mappings.
        *   Validate input data *before* it reaches the RestKit mapping layer (server-side validation).
        *   Review and audit custom value transformers carefully.
        *   Regularly update RestKit.
        *   Fuzz testing.

*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** If RestKit (or a custom component used with it) uses an insecure deserialization mechanism, an attacker might inject malicious objects. This is less likely with standard JSON parsing but a concern with custom formats.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if using standard JSON). Medium (if using custom serialization).
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Avoid custom serialization formats; use standard JSON.
        *   If custom serialization is required, use a secure deserialization library and validate input.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Request/Response Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_requestresponse_handling.md)

*   **Insecure Request Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** Misconfigured request settings, such as disabling SSL certificate validation, using weak ciphers, or allowing HTTP redirects, expose the application to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. RestKit uses the network configuration, making it a relevant attack surface.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Always enforce HTTPS and enable SSL certificate validation.
        *   Use strong ciphers and TLS protocols.
        *   Avoid unnecessary redirects; validate target URLs if redirects are necessary.
        *   Set appropriate timeouts.

*   **Response Tampering [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies the server's response *before* it reaches RestKit, potentially injecting malicious data or manipulating the application's state. This is a MITM attack scenario.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (with HTTPS). Medium (without HTTPS or with weak TLS).
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (with certificate pinning). Medium (without).
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   HTTPS with certificate pinning.
        *   Response validation (checksums, digital signatures) for sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Leakage (via RestKit) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/data_leakage__via_restkit___critical_.md)

*    **Description:** If RestKit is configured to automatically fetch or persist sensitive data, and there are vulnerabilities in the application's authorization logic, an attacker might be able to access data they shouldn't.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    * **Mitigation:**
        * Implement robust authorization checks *before* allowing RestKit to fetch or persist data.
        * Avoid storing sensitive data in Core Data unless absolutely necessary. If you must store sensitive data, encrypt it at rest.
        * Review RestKit's caching behavior.
