# Threat Model Analysis for restkit/restkit

## Threat: [Threat: Unintended Data Exposure via Object Mapping](./threats/threat_unintended_data_exposure_via_object_mapping.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JSON responses that, due to overly permissive or incorrect object mapping configurations in RestKit, inject unexpected data into the application or expose sensitive data that shouldn't be mapped to client-side objects. The attacker could send a response containing fields not expected by the client, or fields that *should* be internal-only.  This leverages RestKit's core mapping functionality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., internal IDs, user roles, API keys if accidentally included in server responses and mapped).
    *   Data corruption or unexpected application behavior due to injection of invalid data types or values.
    *   Potential bypass of client-side validation if the attacker can inject data that passes initial checks but is later used in a security-sensitive context.
*   **RestKit Component Affected:** `RKObjectMapping`, `RKResponseDescriptor`, and related mapping configuration methods. The core object mapping functionality is the primary concern.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Precise Mappings:** Define `RKObjectMapping` instances with explicit attribute mappings. Avoid wildcard mappings or overly broad mappings that could inadvertently include unwanted data.
    *   **Server-Side Validation:** Always validate data on the server *before* sending it to the client (although this is server-side, it's crucial context).
    *   **Client-Side Post-Mapping Validation:** After RestKit maps the data, perform additional input validation on the resulting Objective-C objects. This is a defense-in-depth measure *directly* related to RestKit's output.
    *   **Regular Mapping Audits:** Regularly review and audit object mapping configurations, especially after API changes. This is a direct mitigation for RestKit configuration.
    *   **Least Privilege in Mapping:** Only map the data absolutely necessary for the client. This is a direct RestKit configuration best practice.

## Threat: [Threat: Deserialization Vulnerability (Non-JSON Formats)](./threats/threat_deserialization_vulnerability__non-json_formats_.md)

*   **Description:** If RestKit is configured to use a serialization format *other than* JSON (e.g., a custom format or a potentially vulnerable format like `NSKeyedUnarchiver`), an attacker could craft a malicious payload that, when deserialized by RestKit (or a library it uses), executes arbitrary code on the client device. This is a classic deserialization attack, and the vulnerability lies in *how* RestKit (or its chosen serializer) handles the deserialization.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the client device, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the device itself.
*   **RestKit Component Affected:** Any component involved in deserialization, particularly if using custom parsers or formats other than JSON. This might involve `RKSerialization`, custom `RKRequest/ResponseSerialization` implementations, or underlying libraries used for specific formats. The choice of serializer and its configuration *within RestKit* is the key factor.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prefer JSON:** Strongly prefer JSON as the serialization format. This reduces the *inherent* risk, making RestKit less likely to be vulnerable.
    *   **Secure Deserialization Practices:** If using non-JSON formats, *rigorously* ensure secure deserialization practices are followed. This often involves class whitelisting and avoiding insecure deserialization methods *within the RestKit configuration or custom serializer*.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Audit RestKit and its dependencies for known deserialization vulnerabilities. This is directly related to RestKit's chosen dependencies.
    *   **Avoid Custom Parsers (If Possible):** Minimize the use of custom parsers unless absolutely necessary, and if used, subject them to intense security review. This relates to extending or customizing RestKit's serialization.

## Threat: [Threat: API Key Leakage via HTTP Headers (If Misconfigured in RestKit)](./threats/threat_api_key_leakage_via_http_headers__if_misconfigured_in_restkit_.md)

*   **Description:** While HTTPS is the primary mitigation, if RestKit is *configured* to include API keys or other sensitive tokens directly in HTTP headers (e.g., a custom `Authorization` header), an attacker *could* intercept these if HTTPS fails or is misconfigured. This focuses on the *RestKit configuration* aspect.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the API, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user or access sensitive data.
*   **RestKit Component Affected:** `RKObjectManager`, `RKRequestDescriptor`, and any code that configures HTTP headers for requests *within RestKit* (e.g., `setDefaultHeaders:`). The *configuration* of RestKit is the vulnerable point.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS Everywhere:** Enforce HTTPS for *all* API communication (primary defense, but mentioned for context).
    *   **Secure Header Management:** Carefully review how headers are set *within RestKit*. Avoid placing sensitive information in easily observed headers if a more secure alternative (like OAuth 2.0) is available. This is a direct RestKit configuration issue.
    *   **OAuth 2.0 or Similar:** Use a robust authentication protocol like OAuth 2.0, which avoids sending long-lived credentials in every request. This would influence how RestKit is used.
    * **Review RestKit Configuration:** Ensure that no default headers or request configurations within RestKit are inadvertently exposing sensitive data.

## Threat: [Threat: Improper Core Data Integration (If Used)](./threats/threat_improper_core_data_integration__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If RestKit's Core Data integration features are used, an attacker might exploit misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the mapping between RestKit objects and Core Data entities. This could lead to data leakage, corruption, or unauthorized access to stored data. This is specific to RestKit's Core Data features.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data stored in Core Data.
    *   Data corruption or modification.
    *   Potential for privilege escalation if the attacker can modify data used for authorization.
*   **RestKit Component Affected:** `RKManagedObjectStore`, `RKEntityMapping`, and related Core Data integration components. This is entirely within RestKit's domain.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Core Data Configuration:** Ensure Core Data is configured securely (context, but important).
    *   **Precise Entity Mappings:** Define `RKEntityMapping` instances with explicit attribute mappings, similar to the object mapping recommendations. This is a direct RestKit configuration issue.
    *   **Data Validation (Core Data):** Implement data validation rules within Core Data (context, but relevant to the integration).
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the Core Data integration configuration *within RestKit*.
