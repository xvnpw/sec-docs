# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for restkit/restkit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Object Mapping and Validation (RestKit-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_object_mapping_and_validation__restkit-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Explicit `RKObjectMapping`:**  For *every* API endpoint used with RestKit, define a corresponding `RKObjectMapping` instance.  Do *not* rely on implicit mapping or overly broad configurations.
    2.  **Precise Attribute Types:** Within each `RKObjectMapping`, use `addAttributeMappingsFromArray:` or `addAttributeMappingsFromDictionary:` to *explicitly* define the expected Objective-C data type for *each* attribute.  Avoid relying on RestKit's type inference.  Be as specific as possible (e.g., `NSNumber` with a specific integer or floating-point type, rather than just `NSNumber`).
    3.  **Relationship Mapping:** If your objects have relationships, use `addRelationshipMappingWithSourceKeyPath:mapping:` to define these relationships *explicitly* within the `RKObjectMapping`.  Do not rely on automatic relationship detection.
    4.  **Avoid `RKDynamicMapping` (High Priority):**  Minimize or eliminate the use of `RKDynamicMapping`. If absolutely necessary, ensure extremely robust server-side validation and input sanitization, as `RKDynamicMapping` is inherently more vulnerable to injection.
    5.  **Custom Validation (Within Mapped Classes):** Implement the `validateValue:forKey:error:` method in your model classes (the classes you are mapping *to* with RestKit).  This method is called by RestKit *after* the mapping process.  Use it to:
        *   Verify data types using `isKindOfClass:`.
        *   Check for `nil` values for required properties.
        *   Enforce value ranges or specific constraints.
        *   Return `NO` and populate the `error` parameter if validation fails.
    6.  **RestKit Error Handling:** In your code that uses `RKObjectManager` (or related classes), *always* check the `NSError` object returned in the completion blocks (success/failure).  Handle mapping errors appropriately (e.g., display an error message, retry, or fallback to a default state).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **RestKit Object Mapping Injection (High Severity):** Directly mitigates the risk of attackers injecting malicious data or code through crafted JSON responses that exploit weaknesses in RestKit's mapping process.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of RestKit incorrectly mapping data, leading to data corruption within your application.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Helps ensure that RestKit's mapping process behaves predictably and consistently.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RestKit Object Mapping Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk by making it much harder for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability. This is the *most direct* impact.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Reduces the risk of RestKit-specific mapping errors.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Improves the reliability of RestKit's mapping.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `RKObjectMapping` is defined for `User` objects in `User.m`. `validateValue:forKey:error:` is implemented in `User.m` to check for `nil` email and a valid age range. Error handling is implemented in `NetworkManager.m` where RestKit is used to fetch user data.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `RKObjectMapping` is *not* defined for `Product` objects. `Product` objects are mapped using a more generic approach, making them vulnerable to RestKit-specific injection. `validateValue:forKey:error:` is *not* implemented in `Product.m`. The error handling in `ProductService.m` does not specifically check for RestKit mapping errors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Request Parameter Handling (RestKit Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_request_parameter_handling__restkit_usage_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`RKObjectManager` Methods:** *Always* use the methods provided by `RKObjectManager` (or related RestKit classes like `RKRequestDescriptor`) to construct and send requests.  Do *not* bypass RestKit and manually create `NSURLRequest` objects.
    2.  **Parameter Dictionaries:** Pass request parameters as dictionaries to the appropriate `RKObjectManager` methods (e.g., `getObjectsAtPath:parameters:success:failure:`).  Let RestKit handle the URL encoding.
    3.  **Avoid Manual URL Construction:** Absolutely *never* manually construct URLs by string concatenation, especially when incorporating user-supplied data.  Rely entirely on RestKit's mechanisms for building URLs.
    4.  **Correct HTTP Methods:** Ensure you are using the correct HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each operation *through RestKit's API*.  For example, use `postObject:path:parameters:success:failure:` for creating resources, not a GET request.
    5.  **Sensitive Data in Headers/Body:** Never include sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens) directly in the URL. Use RestKit's mechanisms for setting request headers (e.g., `Authorization`) or include the data in the request body (for POST/PUT requests) *through RestKit's API*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **RestKit Request Parameter Tampering (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating request parameters if you were to bypass RestKit's handling.
    *   **Information Disclosure via URL (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being exposed in URLs by ensuring it's handled correctly *through RestKit*.
    *   **Incorrect HTTP Method Usage (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of using the wrong HTTP method, which could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RestKit Request Parameter Tampering:** Reduces the risk by ensuring that RestKit's built-in parameter handling (which should include proper encoding) is always used.
    *   **Information Disclosure via URL:** Eliminates the risk of sensitive data appearing in URLs when using RestKit correctly.
    *   **Incorrect HTTP Method Usage:** Enforces correct usage through RestKit's API.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `RKObjectManager` methods are consistently used in `NetworkManager.m`. Parameters are passed as dictionaries to RestKit. Sensitive data is sent in the `Authorization` header using RestKit's header management.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: In `LegacyService.m`, a direct `NSURLRequest` is being created and sent, bypassing RestKit entirely for a specific API call. This needs to be refactored to use `RKObjectManager`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deserialization with RestKit (Focus on `NSSecureCoding`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deserialization_with_restkit__focus_on__nssecurecoding__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Persisted Objects (RestKit-Related):** Determine which of your model classes are being persisted to disk using RestKit's object mapping *and* persistence features (usually involving `RKManagedObjectStore` and Core Data integration). This is crucial: only classes managed by RestKit for persistence need this.
    2.  **`NSSecureCoding` Implementation:** For *each* of these identified classes, ensure they implement the `NSSecureCoding` protocol *correctly*:
        *   **Protocol Conformance:** Add `<NSSecureCoding>` to the class interface: `@interface MyClass : NSObject <NSSecureCoding>`.
        *   **`supportsSecureCoding`:** Implement the class method `+ (BOOL)supportsSecureCoding { return YES; }`.
        *   **Secure Coding Methods:** Implement `initWithCoder:` and `encodeWithCoder:`, using the *secure* coding methods provided by `NSCoder`.  Crucially, use `decodeObjectOfClass:forKey:` instead of `decodeObjectForKey:`.  This restricts the types of objects that can be decoded, preventing certain deserialization attacks.  Similarly, use the secure encoding methods.
    3.  **Post-Deserialization Validation (Within `initWithCoder:`):** Even with `NSSecureCoding`, *always* perform additional validation *after* an object has been deserialized (within the `initWithCoder:` method). This is because `NSSecureCoding` prevents certain *types* of attacks, but it doesn't guarantee the *data itself* is valid.
        *   Check data types.
        *   Check for `nil` values if properties are required.
        *   Enforce value ranges or other constraints.
        *   If validation fails, you might choose to return `nil` from `initWithCoder:` or take other appropriate action.
    4. **Avoid Untrusted Data with RestKit Persistence:** Do *not* use RestKit's persistence features to store data received from untrusted sources (user input, external APIs) without *extremely* thorough sanitization and validation *before* passing it to RestKit.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **RestKit Deserialization Attacks (High Severity):** Directly addresses the risk of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in RestKit's deserialization process (when used with Core Data) to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of malicious data being loaded from persistent storage *through RestKit*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RestKit Deserialization Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk, especially when `NSSecureCoding` is implemented correctly and combined with post-deserialization validation.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Reduces the risk related to RestKit's persistence.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `User` class implements `NSSecureCoding` correctly, including secure coding methods and post-deserialization validation within `initWithCoder:`. RestKit is used to persist `User` objects.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `Product` class, which is also persisted using RestKit, does *not* implement `NSSecureCoding`. Post-deserialization validation is missing in `Product`'s `initWithCoder:` method (which doesn't even exist currently).
