# Threat Model Analysis for restkit/restkit

## Threat: [Malicious Deserialization](./threats/malicious_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious API response (e.g., JSON or XML) that, when deserialized by RestKit, exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization process. This could involve injecting code or manipulating object states during deserialization. The attacker might control an external API or compromise a legitimate API endpoint.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application's system.
        *   Application crash or denial of service due to resource exhaustion.
        *   Information disclosure by manipulating object states to reveal sensitive data.
    *   **Affected RestKit Component:**
        *   **RKResponseSerialization:** The module responsible for deserializing API responses.
        *   Underlying parsing libraries used by RestKit (e.g., `SBJson`, `KissXML`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep RestKit and its dependencies updated:** Regularly update to the latest versions to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input validation and sanitization:** Even though the data comes from an API, validate and sanitize the deserialized data before using it in the application.
        *   **Consider alternative serialization libraries:** If feasible, explore using more secure or less feature-rich serialization libraries if the full capabilities of the default ones are not needed.
        *   **Implement robust error handling:**  Prevent application crashes from propagating and potentially revealing information.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Mapping leading to Data Corruption](./threats/insecure_data_mapping_leading_to_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the API response in a way that, when mapped to application objects by RestKit, overwrites critical or sensitive data within the application's state. This could be achieved by sending unexpected data types or values that are not properly handled by the mapping logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data corruption within the application, leading to incorrect functionality or unexpected behavior.
        *   Potentially unauthorized modification of user data or application settings.
        *   Logic errors that could be further exploited.
    *   **Affected RestKit Component:**
        *   **RKObjectMapping:** The module responsible for mapping API response data to application objects.
        *   **RKResponseDescriptor:** Defines how responses are mapped to objects.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict data type checking in mappings:** Define mappings with precise data types and handle type mismatches gracefully.
        *   **Input validation within mapping blocks:** Implement validation logic within the mapping blocks to ensure data conforms to expected constraints.
        *   **Principle of least privilege for data access:** Limit the scope of data that can be modified through API interactions.
        *   **Thorough testing of mapping configurations:** Ensure that mappings handle various valid and invalid API responses correctly.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack due to Insecure TLS Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_due_to_insecure_tls_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the API server. This is possible if the application is configured to disable SSL certificate verification or uses weak or outdated TLS versions through RestKit's networking capabilities. The attacker can then eavesdrop on or modify the communication.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between the application and the API (e.g., authentication tokens, user data).
        *   Manipulation of API requests or responses, leading to unauthorized actions or data corruption.
    *   **Affected RestKit Component:**
        *   **RKSessionConfiguration:**  Configuration settings related to `NSURLSession`, which handles network requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable SSL certificate verification:** Ensure that RestKit is configured to validate the SSL certificates of the API server.
        *   **Use strong and up-to-date TLS versions:** Configure RestKit to use the latest recommended TLS versions and disable older, insecure protocols.
        *   **Implement certificate pinning (advanced):** For highly sensitive applications, consider implementing certificate pinning to further restrict trusted certificates.
        *   **Use HTTPS for all API communication:** Ensure that all API endpoints are accessed over HTTPS.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** RestKit relies on other libraries for networking, data parsing, and other functionalities. If these underlying dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, the application using RestKit could be directly affected due to RestKit's reliance on them.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from remote code execution to denial of service or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected RestKit Component:**
        *   All components of RestKit that rely on external libraries (e.g., networking, serialization).
        *   Specifically, the underlying HTTP client library (often `NSURLSession` wrappers) and parsing libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update RestKit and its dependencies:** Use dependency management tools to keep all libraries up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Monitor security advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities affecting RestKit and its dependencies.
        *   **Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools:** These tools can help identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
