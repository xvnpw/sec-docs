# Attack Surface Analysis for restkit/restkit

## Attack Surface: [Insecure HTTP Connections](./attack_surfaces/insecure_http_connections.md)

Description: Communication between the application and the API server occurs over unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS, allowing eavesdropping and data interception.

RestKit Contribution: RestKit can be configured to use HTTP if HTTPS is not explicitly enforced during request configuration or at a global level. This direct configuration within RestKit determines the protocol used.

Example: An application sends user login credentials over HTTP using RestKit because HTTPS was not explicitly configured. An attacker intercepts the traffic and steals the credentials.

Impact: Confidentiality breach, credential theft, data manipulation, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Enforce HTTPS: Configure RestKit to exclusively use HTTPS for all network requests. Set this as a default and explicitly enforced setting within RestKit's configuration.
*   Transport Security Configuration: Review and configure RestKit's transport security settings to ensure HTTPS is properly enabled and configured at the framework level.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Transport Layer Security (TLS) Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_transport_layer_security__tls__configuration.md)

Description: Even when using HTTPS, the TLS configuration might be weak or outdated due to settings within RestKit or its underlying libraries.

RestKit Contribution: RestKit relies on underlying networking libraries for TLS implementation, and its configuration can influence the TLS settings used.  RestKit's configuration choices directly impact the strength of TLS.

Example: RestKit is configured (or defaults to) allowing TLS 1.0 or weak cipher suites. An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in TLS 1.0 to downgrade the connection and perform a MITM attack.

Impact: Data breach, MITM attacks, weakened encryption.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Use Strong TLS Versions: Ensure RestKit and its dependencies are configured to use TLS 1.2 or higher. Disable support for older, insecure TLS versions through RestKit's configuration or its dependencies' settings.
*   Strong Cipher Suites: Configure RestKit to use strong and secure cipher suites. Avoid weak or outdated ciphers by configuring RestKit or its underlying libraries appropriately.
*   Regular Updates: Keep RestKit and its underlying networking libraries updated to benefit from security patches and improvements in TLS handling, ensuring RestKit is using the latest secure TLS implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_manipulation.md)

Description:  Improper URL construction using user input within RestKit requests can lead to SSRF, allowing attackers to control the destination of requests.

RestKit Contribution: RestKit's API allows for flexible URL construction. If developers use user-controlled input directly in URL creation *when using RestKit's request building features* without sanitization, it becomes vulnerable. The way RestKit handles URL requests can be directly exploited.

Example: An application uses RestKit to fetch data based on a user-provided URL parameter. An attacker manipulates this parameter to point to an internal server, causing RestKit to make a request to an unintended internal resource.

Impact: Access to internal systems, data leakage, privilege escalation, denial of service.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Input Validation and Sanitization:  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input used in constructing URLs for RestKit requests *before passing them to RestKit's request methods*.
*   Parameterized Requests: Utilize parameterized requests or URL building methods provided by RestKit to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into URLs within RestKit's request construction.
*   URL Allow-lists: Implement allow-lists for allowed domains or URL patterns that RestKit is permitted to access, restricting RestKit's request destinations.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Data Parsing (JSON/XML)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_data_parsing__jsonxml_.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities in JSON/XML parsing libraries used by RestKit can be exploited via malicious data, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution.

RestKit Contribution: RestKit directly utilizes JSON and XML parsing libraries for data mapping and response processing. Vulnerabilities in these libraries are directly exposed through RestKit's data handling.

Example: A vulnerability exists in the JSON parsing library used by RestKit. An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload to an API endpoint. When RestKit parses this payload, it triggers remote code execution due to the vulnerability in the parsing library.

Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), unexpected application behavior.

Risk Severity: Critical (for RCE)

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Keep Dependencies Updated: Regularly update RestKit and its dependencies, especially JSON and XML parsing libraries, to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. This is crucial as RestKit relies on these libraries.
*   Input Validation: Implement input validation on data received from external sources *before* parsing it with RestKit. While not a complete mitigation for deserialization flaws, it can reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Authentication Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_authentication_credentials.md)

Description:  Developers might insecurely store authentication credentials when using RestKit for authentication workflows.

RestKit Contribution: While RestKit doesn't *cause* insecure storage, its use in authentication scenarios can lead developers to handle and potentially store credentials insecurely *in the context of using RestKit for API communication*.  The need to manage credentials for RestKit requests can lead to insecure practices.

Example: An API key used with RestKit is hardcoded in the application's source code. An attacker gains access to the source code and extracts the API key, compromising access to the API.

Impact: Credential compromise, unauthorized API access, account takeover.

Risk Severity: Critical

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Secure Credential Storage: Avoid hardcoding or storing credentials in code or configuration files.
*   Environment Variables/Key Vaults: Utilize environment variables or secure key vaults to manage and store API keys and other credentials used with RestKit, keeping them separate from the application code.
*   Never Log Credentials: Ensure sensitive credentials used with RestKit are never logged in application logs.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in RestKit Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_restkit_dependencies.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by RestKit can indirectly compromise applications using RestKit.

RestKit Contribution: RestKit's architecture relies on external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact the security of applications using RestKit, as these libraries are integral to RestKit's functionality.

Example: A critical vulnerability is discovered in `AFNetworking`, a networking library used by RestKit. Applications using RestKit that depend on the vulnerable version of `AFNetworking` are also critically vulnerable.

Impact: Application compromise, data breach, Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the dependency vulnerability.

Risk Severity: Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Regularly Update Dependencies: Keep RestKit and *all* its dependencies updated to the latest versions. This is paramount as dependency vulnerabilities directly affect RestKit users.
*   Dependency Scanning: Implement dependency scanning tools to proactively identify vulnerabilities in RestKit's dependencies and trigger updates.
