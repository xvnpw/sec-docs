# Threat Model Analysis for restkit/restkit

## Threat: [Malicious Server Response Exploitation](./threats/malicious_server_response_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker controlling or compromising the API server sends crafted responses designed to exploit vulnerabilities in RestKit's object mapping process. The attacker aims to cause unexpected application behavior, crashes, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the client device by manipulating the data being parsed and mapped by RestKit.
    * **Impact:** Application instability, data corruption, potential remote code execution on the client device.
    * **RestKit Component Affected:** Object Mapping Module, Response Deserialization (e.g., JSON or XML parsing).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data received *after* RestKit mapping.
        * Keep RestKit and its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        * Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
        * Use schema validation for API responses before mapping to enforce expected data structures.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** An attacker leverages insecure deserialization practices within RestKit or its underlying libraries. By sending specially crafted data in formats like XML or through custom serializers, the attacker aims to trigger code execution when RestKit deserializes this malicious data. This exploits potential flaws in how RestKit handles data conversion from serialized formats back into objects.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution on the client device.
    * **RestKit Component Affected:** Response Deserialization Module (specifically XML parsing or custom serializers), potentially underlying parsing libraries.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure RestKit and its dependencies use secure deserialization practices.
        * Exercise caution when using custom serializers/deserializers and thoroughly vet them for security.
        * Limit accepted API data formats to necessary and secure ones.
        * Regularly audit and update RestKit and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Transport Configuration (Weak TLS/SSL)](./threats/insecure_transport_configuration__weak_tlsssl_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by intercepting network traffic between the application and the API server. This is possible if HTTPS is not enforced, weak TLS/SSL configurations are used, or certificate validation is disabled within RestKit's networking configuration. The attacker can eavesdrop on communication, steal sensitive data, or even modify requests and responses.
    * **Impact:** Data confidentiality and integrity compromise, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, potential data theft or manipulation.
    * **RestKit Component Affected:** Networking Module (specifically `RKObjectManager` and related networking configuration).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS for API communication.
        * **Proper TLS/SSL Configuration:** Use strong TLS/SSL configurations, avoiding weak protocols and ciphers within RestKit's settings.
        * **Strict Certificate Validation:** Ensure certificate validation is enabled and properly configured in RestKit.
        * **Implement Certificate Pinning (Recommended for High Security):** Pin specific certificates for the API server within RestKit's configuration to prevent MITM attacks even with compromised CAs.

## Threat: [Insecure Transport Configuration (Ignoring Certificate Errors)](./threats/insecure_transport_configuration__ignoring_certificate_errors_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker sets up a rogue server impersonating the legitimate API server. If the application is configured to ignore certificate validation errors in RestKit, it will connect to this rogue server without warning. The attacker can then intercept communication, steal data, or send malicious responses.
    * **Impact:** Data confidentiality and integrity compromise, connection to malicious servers, potential data theft or manipulation.
    * **RestKit Component Affected:** Networking Module (specifically `RKObjectManager` and certificate validation settings).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never disable certificate validation** in RestKit's configuration.
        * Ensure certificate validation is properly configured and enabled in RestKit.
        * Implement robust error handling for certificate validation failures, alerting the user if necessary.
        * Consider certificate pinning for enhanced security within RestKit's configuration.
