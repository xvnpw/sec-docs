# Threat Model Analysis for restkit/restkit

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Insecure URL Handling](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_insecure_url_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the URL provided to RestKit's networking functions (e.g., `getObjectsAtPath:parameters:success:failure:`, `postObject:path:parameters:success:failure:`) to point to internal resources or external systems. RestKit, without sufficient validation, would make a request to this attacker-controlled URL.

**Impact:** The attacker could potentially access internal services not exposed to the public internet, read sensitive files on the server, or use the application's server as a proxy to attack other systems.

**Affected RestKit Component:** `RKObjectManager`, `RKRequestOperation` (specifically the URL construction and request execution).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict URL validation on the application side *before* passing URLs to RestKit's networking methods.
*   Use allow-lists for permitted domains and paths.
*   Avoid constructing URLs dynamically based on user input without thorough sanitization.
*   Consider using RestKit's request interception capabilities to add an extra layer of validation.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack via Insecure Redirect Handling](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_via_insecure_redirect_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept the communication between the application and the API server and inject a redirect response. If RestKit automatically follows redirects without proper verification (e.g., ensuring the redirect remains on HTTPS), the application could be redirected to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.

**Impact:** The attacker could steal sensitive data transmitted by the application, including authentication credentials or API keys. They could also serve malicious content or manipulate the application's state.

**Affected RestKit Component:** `RKRequestOperation` (specifically the handling of HTTP redirect responses).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure RestKit to strictly enforce HTTPS for all network requests and redirects.
*   Implement custom redirect handling with thorough validation of the redirect URL's scheme and domain.
*   Consider disabling automatic redirect following and handling redirects manually with security checks.

## Threat: [Data Corruption or Privilege Escalation via Object Mapping Exploitation](./threats/data_corruption_or_privilege_escalation_via_object_mapping_exploitation.md)

**Description:** If the object mapping configuration in RestKit is not carefully defined, an attacker might be able to manipulate the API response to overwrite unintended properties in the application's data models. This could involve setting sensitive fields to incorrect values or modifying relationships between objects in a way that grants unauthorized access or modifies data.

**Impact:** The application's data integrity is compromised, potentially leading to incorrect behavior, security breaches, or unauthorized access to features or data.

**Affected RestKit Component:** `RKObjectMapping`, `RKResponseMapperOperation`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully define object mappings and ensure they only map expected data from the API response to the intended properties.
*   Use explicit mapping configurations and avoid overly permissive mappings that could allow arbitrary data to be set.
*   Implement validation logic after object mapping to verify the integrity and expected values of the mapped data.

## Threat: [Insufficient Certificate Pinning Leading to MITM](./threats/insufficient_certificate_pinning_leading_to_mitm.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on RestKit's default certificate validation without implementing certificate pinning, it might be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker can compromise a Certificate Authority (CA) trusted by the device.

**Impact:** An attacker could intercept and decrypt communication between the application and the API server, potentially stealing sensitive data or manipulating the communication.

**Affected RestKit Component:** `RKObjectManager`'s security policy settings, `RKRequestOperation`'s SSL handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement certificate pinning to explicitly trust only specific certificates or public keys for the API server. RestKit provides mechanisms for setting custom security policies.
