* **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Constraints
    * **Description:** A malicious actor can cause the application to become unresponsive or crash by forcing the creation of an overwhelming number of complex or conflicting layout constraints. This consumes excessive system resources (CPU, memory).
    * **How PureLayout Contributes:** PureLayout simplifies the creation of constraints programmatically. While beneficial for development, this ease of use can be exploited if the application logic allows external influence over the number or complexity of constraints being created.
    * **Example:** An attacker manipulates data received from a remote server that dictates the number of subviews and their constraints. By sending a crafted payload with an extremely large number of views, the application attempts to create a massive number of constraints using PureLayout, leading to resource exhaustion and a crash.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes unusable, potentially leading to data loss or service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement input validation and sanitization on any data that influences the creation of layout constraints.
        * Set limits on the number of views or constraints that can be created dynamically based on external input.
        * Implement timeouts or resource monitoring to detect and handle situations where constraint creation is taking an unusually long time or consuming excessive resources.
