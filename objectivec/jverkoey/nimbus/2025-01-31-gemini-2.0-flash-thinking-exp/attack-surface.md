# Attack Surface Analysis for jverkoey/nimbus

## Attack Surface: [HTML Injection/XSS in NimbusWebEditor (if used)](./attack_surfaces/html_injectionxss_in_nimbuswebeditor__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious HTML code when using NimbusWebEditor to display or allow user input of HTML content.
*   **Nimbus Contribution:** NimbusWebEditor, by design, provides HTML editing and rendering capabilities. This inherently introduces HTML injection risks if not handled carefully. The vulnerability is directly tied to the use of NimbusWebEditor.
*   **Example:** An application uses NimbusWebEditor to allow users to create rich text notes. An attacker injects malicious HTML, including JavaScript, into a note. When another user views this note, the injected JavaScript executes within the application's context, potentially stealing data or manipulating the UI.
*   **Impact:** UI manipulation, data theft (within the application context), clickjacking, potential for more severe attacks depending on the capabilities of the web editor environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if JavaScript execution is possible, otherwise potentially lower but still significant depending on context).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using NimbusWebEditor for untrusted HTML input if possible.** Consider alternative, safer rich text solutions if HTML editing is not strictly necessary.
    *   **Strict HTML sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize all HTML input to remove or escape potentially harmful tags and attributes *before* it is processed by NimbusWebEditor. Use a robust and actively maintained HTML sanitization library.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) - like restrictions:** If NimbusWebEditor allows configuration, restrict the capabilities of loaded HTML content.  Specifically, disable JavaScript execution if it's not a required feature.
    *   **Contextual output encoding:** Encode HTML output based on the rendering context to prevent interpretation of malicious code by NimbusWebEditor.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Credential Storage in NimbusNetworkAuth (if used)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_credential_storage_in_nimbusnetworkauth__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Storing authentication credentials insecurely when using NimbusNetworkAuth, leading to potential credential theft.
*   **Nimbus Contribution:** If NimbusNetworkAuth provides mechanisms for credential storage and these mechanisms are flawed or insecure, Nimbus directly contributes to this critical vulnerability. The risk arises from the design or implementation choices within NimbusNetworkAuth itself.
*   **Example:** NimbusNetworkAuth stores user passwords in plain text or uses a weak, easily reversible encryption method in local storage. An attacker gains physical or remote access to the device's file system and retrieves the stored credentials, leading to complete account compromise.
*   **Impact:** Credential theft, account compromise, unauthorized access to user data and all application functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never use NimbusNetworkAuth's credential storage if it does not utilize secure system APIs (like iOS Keychain).**  If NimbusNetworkAuth offers insecure storage options, avoid them entirely.
    *   **Force NimbusNetworkAuth (if configurable) to use the iOS Keychain for credential storage.**  The Keychain is the recommended and secure way to store sensitive data on iOS.
    *   **If custom storage is unavoidable with NimbusNetworkAuth, implement strong, industry-standard encryption** and follow secure coding practices meticulously. However, using the Keychain is strongly preferred.
    *   **Regular and rigorous security audits of NimbusNetworkAuth's credential storage implementation** are essential if custom storage is used.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Authentication Flows in NimbusNetworkAuth (if used)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_authentication_flows_in_nimbusnetworkauth__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in custom authentication flows implemented by NimbusNetworkAuth, leading to authentication bypass or session hijacking.
*   **Nimbus Contribution:** If NimbusNetworkAuth provides custom authentication flow implementations, vulnerabilities in these flows are directly attributable to Nimbus. The security of these flows is dependent on the design and implementation within NimbusNetworkAuth.
*   **Example:** NimbusNetworkAuth implements a custom authentication flow that is vulnerable to replay attacks, or uses a predictable session token generation algorithm. An attacker can exploit these flaws to bypass authentication entirely or hijack legitimate user sessions, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts and application functionality, potentially leading to complete compromise of user data and application features.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the ease of exploitation and the extent of access gained).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prefer standard, well-vetted authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) over custom flows within NimbusNetworkAuth if possible.** Relying on established protocols reduces the risk of introducing custom vulnerabilities.
    *   **If custom flows are necessary with NimbusNetworkAuth, ensure they are designed and implemented with robust security principles in mind.**  This includes proper input validation, secure session management, protection against common authentication attacks (replay, brute-force, etc.).
    *   **Implement strong, unpredictable session tokens and secure session management practices** within NimbusNetworkAuth's custom flows.
    *   **Mandatory and thorough security review and penetration testing of any custom authentication flows implemented by NimbusNetworkAuth.**  Independent security experts should assess the flows for vulnerabilities.
