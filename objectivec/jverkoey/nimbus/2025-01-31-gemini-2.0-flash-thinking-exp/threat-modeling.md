# Threat Model Analysis for jverkoey/nimbus

## Threat: [Nimbus Networking Code Vulnerability](./threats/nimbus_networking_code_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** Attacker exploits a vulnerability within Nimbus's networking components. This could be in how Nimbus handles HTTP requests, parses responses, or manages network connections. An attacker might send crafted network requests or responses to trigger the vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's device, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application and potentially the device. Denial of Service (DoS), crashing the application or making it unresponsive. Information Disclosure, leaking sensitive data handled by Nimbus's networking layer.
* **Nimbus Component Affected:** Networking (core networking modules within Nimbus, potentially related to `NIHTTPRequest`, `NIURLConnectionOperation`, and any internal networking utilities).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:**  Stay vigilant for Nimbus security advisories and updates.  Immediately update to the latest version of Nimbus when security patches are released. Implement robust input validation on data *sent* in network requests as a defense-in-depth measure, even though the vulnerability is in Nimbus's handling of responses or internal networking.
    * **Framework Developer (Nimbus Maintainers):** Prioritize regular security audits and penetration testing of Nimbus's networking code.  Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and patching process. Communicate security updates effectively to users of the framework.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Cached Data (Sensitive Information)](./threats/insecure_storage_of_cached_data__sensitive_information_.md)

* **Description:** Nimbus's default caching mechanisms (disk or memory) might store sensitive data without adequate encryption. If the application uses Nimbus to cache sensitive information (e.g., user tokens, API keys, personal data) and relies on Nimbus's default caching, this data could be exposed. An attacker gaining physical access to the device or access to device backups could potentially retrieve this unencrypted cached data.
* **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of sensitive user data. Exposure of credentials or personal information leading to account compromise, identity theft, or other privacy violations.
* **Nimbus Component Affected:** Caching (disk and memory caching features within Nimbus, specifically how Nimbus handles data storage and encryption within its cache).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:** Avoid caching sensitive data using Nimbus's default caching mechanisms if they are not demonstrably secure (encrypted at rest). If caching sensitive data is necessary, do *not* rely on Nimbus's default caching for sensitive information. Instead, use secure storage mechanisms provided by iOS, such as the Keychain, to encrypt and store sensitive cached data.  Thoroughly review Nimbus documentation to understand its caching security features and limitations.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning via Nimbus Caching Mechanism](./threats/cache_poisoning_via_nimbus_caching_mechanism.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates network responses or exploits vulnerabilities in Nimbus's cache validation process to inject malicious or incorrect data into Nimbus's cache. When the application retrieves data from the poisoned cache, it operates on this malicious data, potentially leading to application malfunction or security breaches. This could involve manipulating cache control headers or exploiting weaknesses in how Nimbus verifies cached data integrity.
* **Impact:** Application displaying incorrect or malicious content to users. Data corruption within the application. Potential for exploitation if the poisoned cached data is used in security-sensitive operations or displayed in a way that leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if rendered in web views.
* **Nimbus Component Affected:** Caching (cache validation, integrity checks, and potentially cache retrieval logic within Nimbus).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:** Implement robust cache validation mechanisms *in addition* to any validation provided by Nimbus.  Verify the integrity and expected source of data retrieved from the Nimbus cache before using it.  Consider using digital signatures or checksums to ensure the integrity of cached data, independent of Nimbus's internal mechanisms.  Carefully review and configure Nimbus's caching policies and validation options, if available, to minimize the risk of cache poisoning.

## Threat: [Nimbus UI Component Vulnerability Leading to Exploitation](./threats/nimbus_ui_component_vulnerability_leading_to_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability exists within a Nimbus UI component (e.g., in rendering logic, data handling, or event processing). An attacker can craft malicious data or interactions that, when processed by the vulnerable Nimbus UI component, trigger unintended behavior. This could involve displaying specially crafted content or exploiting input handling flaws in Nimbus UI elements.
* **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution through the UI component. Application crash or unexpected UI behavior leading to Denial of Service or usability issues. Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if UI components are used to display web content and are vulnerable to injection.
* **Nimbus Component Affected:** UI Components (specific UI elements provided by Nimbus, such as `NIAttributedLabel`, `NICollectionView`, or custom UI components built using Nimbus's UI framework).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE), High (if XSS or significant application compromise).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:** Stay informed about Nimbus security updates and patch releases.  Update to the latest Nimbus version promptly. Implement input validation and sanitization for all data displayed or processed by Nimbus UI components, especially if displaying user-generated content or data from external sources.  Report any suspicious behavior or crashes related to Nimbus UI components to the Nimbus maintainers.
    * **Framework Developer (Nimbus Maintainers):** Conduct thorough security testing of all Nimbus UI components, focusing on input validation, rendering logic, and event handling.  Address and patch any discovered vulnerabilities in UI components with high priority.

## Threat: [General, Undisclosed Nimbus Framework Vulnerability](./threats/general__undisclosed_nimbus_framework_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An unknown vulnerability exists within the core Nimbus framework code, outside of specific components already identified. This could be a flaw in memory management, core logic, or any other part of the framework's codebase. The nature of the vulnerability is unknown until discovered and potentially exploited.
* **Impact:**  The impact is highly variable and depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation, or other forms of security compromise.  A core framework vulnerability could potentially affect any application using Nimbus.
* **Nimbus Component Affected:** Core Nimbus Framework (any part of the framework's codebase not specifically categorized above).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (potential for widespread and severe impact due to core framework vulnerability).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developer:**  Maintain awareness of Nimbus updates and security communications.  Adopt a proactive security posture by regularly updating Nimbus to the latest stable version. Implement general security best practices within the application as a defense-in-depth strategy to limit the potential impact of any undiscovered framework vulnerabilities. Participate in the Nimbus community and report any unusual behavior or potential security concerns.
    * **Framework Developer (Nimbus Maintainers):**  Prioritize ongoing security audits and code reviews of the entire Nimbus framework. Encourage security researchers to examine the framework for vulnerabilities through a bug bounty or responsible disclosure program.  Respond promptly and transparently to any reported security issues.
