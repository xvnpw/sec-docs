## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: XSS via User-Controlled Input Fields](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_xss_via_user-controlled_input_fields.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-controlled input fields (e.g., forms, search bars) within the application.
*   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
    *   Compromise Application Using Nimbus (Root Goal)
    *   Exploit Nimbus Client-Side Vulnerabilities
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Nimbus
    *   Inject Payload into Application (User-Controlled Input Fields)
    *   Payload Execution
    *   Achieve XSS Impact
*   **Impact:** If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser when they interact with content rendered by Nimbus. This can lead to session hijacking (stealing cookies/tokens), UI defacement, redirection to malicious sites, performing actions on behalf of the user, or data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: XSS via URL Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_xss_via_url_parameters.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within URL parameters that are processed and rendered by Nimbus.
*   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
    *   Compromise Application Using Nimbus (Root Goal)
    *   Exploit Nimbus Client-Side Vulnerabilities
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Nimbus
    *   Inject Payload into Application (URL Parameters)
    *   Payload Execution
    *   Achieve XSS Impact
*   **Impact:** Similar to XSS via user-controlled input, successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution, leading to session hijacking, UI defacement, redirection, actions on behalf of the user, or data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Misuse - Improper Input Sanitization Before Nimbus Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_misuse_-_improper_input_sanitization_before_nimbus_rendering.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers fail to properly sanitize user-provided data *before* passing it to Nimbus for rendering. If Nimbus itself has vulnerabilities in handling unsanitized input, or if the application logic around Nimbus is flawed, this can lead to XSS.
*   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
    *   Compromise Application Using Nimbus (Root Goal)
    *   Exploit Misuse of Nimbus by Developers
    *   Insecure Integration with Nimbus
    *   Identify Insecure Nimbus Usage Patterns
    *   Improper Input Sanitization Before Nimbus Rendering
    *   Achieve Impact of Misuse
*   **Impact:**  This misuse often results in XSS vulnerabilities. The impact is the same as described in High-Risk Path 1 and 2, including session hijacking, UI defacement, redirection, actions on behalf of the user, or data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Misuse - Exposing Sensitive Data in Nimbus-Rendered UI](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_misuse_-_exposing_sensitive_data_in_nimbus-rendered_ui.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers unintentionally use Nimbus to display sensitive information in the application's user interface without proper access controls or masking.
*   **Critical Nodes Involved:**
    *   Compromise Application Using Nimbus (Root Goal)
    *   Exploit Misuse of Nimbus by Developers
    *   Insecure Integration with Nimbus
    *   Identify Insecure Nimbus Usage Patterns
    *   Exposing Sensitive Data in Nimbus-Rendered UI
    *   Achieve Impact of Misuse
*   **Impact:** This leads to information disclosure. Attackers or unauthorized users can gain access to sensitive data that should not be exposed in the client-side UI, potentially leading to privacy violations, data breaches, or further attacks based on the revealed information.
