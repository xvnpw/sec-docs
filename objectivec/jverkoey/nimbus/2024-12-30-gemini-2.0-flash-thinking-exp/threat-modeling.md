### Nimbus Image Caching Library - High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Nimbus

This list details high and critical security threats that directly involve the Nimbus image caching library.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Image Injection during Download
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the image source (e.g., a CDN, backend server, or intercepts network traffic) and replaces legitimate images with malicious ones. Nimbus, unaware of the substitution, downloads and caches the compromised image. Subsequently, the application serves this malicious image *from its Nimbus cache*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the malicious image is crafted with embedded scripts (e.g., through SVG format vulnerabilities), it could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser when displayed.
        *   **Exploitation of Image Rendering Vulnerabilities:** The malicious image could exploit vulnerabilities in the image rendering libraries used by the application or the user's browser, potentially leading to crashes, denial of service, or even remote code execution.
        *   **Displaying Harmful Content:** The replaced image could contain offensive, misleading, or harmful content, damaging the application's reputation or causing distress to users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Cache Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the *Nimbus caching mechanism* to associate a malicious image with the URL of a legitimate image. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the image source or by intercepting and modifying responses *before Nimbus caches the image*. When the application requests the legitimate image URL, Nimbus retrieves and caches the attacker's malicious image.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malicious image injection, this can lead to XSS, exploitation of rendering vulnerabilities, or the display of harmful content to users who expect a legitimate image.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
