## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Nimbus](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_nimbus.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting weaknesses within the Nimbus library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Nimbus Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_nimbus_code.md)

This critical node encompasses all attack vectors that directly target flaws in the Nimbus library's own code. This includes memory corruption vulnerabilities during image processing and logic errors within Nimbus's functionality. Successfully exploiting vulnerabilities here can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Memory Corruption during Image Processing](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_corruption_during_image_processing.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., a manipulated JPEG or PNG) through an input mechanism that Nimbus processes.
*   **Mechanism:** The crafted image contains data that exploits vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, integer overflows, heap overflows) in the underlying image decoding library when Nimbus attempts to process it.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption, allowing the attacker to overwrite memory, potentially execute arbitrary code (Remote Code Execution - RCE), or cause the application to crash (Denial of Service).
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Prioritize updating image decoding libraries, consider input validation (though challenging for binary data), and explore sandboxing image processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Vulnerable Image Decoding Logic](./attack_tree_paths/target_vulnerable_image_decoding_logic.md)

This node highlights the critical dependency on underlying image decoding libraries. Attackers target vulnerabilities within these libraries (often provided by the operating system or bundled) to trigger memory corruption. This is a common and well-understood attack vector against applications that process image data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Nimbus](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_nimbus.md)

This node emphasizes the risk introduced by third-party libraries that Nimbus relies on. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, attackers can leverage Nimbus's API to trigger those vulnerabilities and compromise the application. This underscores the importance of diligent dependency management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in those Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_those_libraries.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in a library that Nimbus depends on.
*   **Mechanism:** The attacker crafts an input or triggers a specific sequence of actions through Nimbus's API that interacts with the vulnerable dependency in a way that exploits the known flaw.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it can range from RCE and data breaches to denial of service.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Implement robust dependency management practices, including maintaining a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), regularly scanning dependencies for vulnerabilities, and promptly applying security updates.
