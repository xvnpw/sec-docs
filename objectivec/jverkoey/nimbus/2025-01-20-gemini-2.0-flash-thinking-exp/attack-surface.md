# Attack Surface Analysis for jverkoey/nimbus

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks due to Insecure Connections](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_due_to_insecure_connections.md)

* **Description:** Attackers intercept communication between the application and the server, potentially reading or modifying sensitive data.
* **How Nimbus Contributes:** If the application's configuration when using Nimbus allows for or defaults to non-HTTPS connections, Nimbus will facilitate these insecure requests, making the application vulnerable to MitM attacks. Nimbus is the direct mechanism for the unencrypted communication.
* **Example:** An application using Nimbus is configured to fetch data from an HTTP endpoint. An attacker on the same network intercepts the data being transmitted.
* **Impact:** Confidential data leakage, unauthorized access, data manipulation.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Enforce HTTPS in Nimbus Configuration:** Ensure the application explicitly configures Nimbus to use HTTPS for all network requests. This might involve setting specific protocols or options within Nimbus's request building or configuration methods.
    * **Avoid Configuration Options that Allow HTTP:**  Carefully review Nimbus's configuration options and avoid using any settings that would permit non-HTTPS connections for sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Network Requests](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_network_requests.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive data (API keys, user tokens, etc.) is inadvertently included in network requests where it can be intercepted.
* **How Nimbus Contributes:** When using Nimbus to build and send requests, developers might incorrectly include sensitive information in URL parameters or headers. Nimbus directly transmits these requests, exposing the sensitive data.
* **Example:** An API key is directly added as a URL parameter when creating a request using Nimbus's request builder. This key is then transmitted in the clear and can be logged or intercepted.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, account compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid Passing Sensitive Data in URLs via Nimbus:** When constructing requests with Nimbus, avoid including sensitive information directly in the URL.
    * **Use Secure Methods for Passing Credentials:**  Utilize Nimbus's capabilities for setting secure headers (e.g., Authorization header with a bearer token) or use request bodies for sensitive data when appropriate.
    * **Review Nimbus Request Construction:** Carefully audit how network requests are built using Nimbus to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via URL Manipulation (Directly Triggered by Nimbus)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_url_manipulation__directly_triggered_by_nimbus_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can trick the application into making requests to unintended internal or external resources.
* **How Nimbus Contributes:** If the application directly uses user-controlled input to construct URLs that are then used in Nimbus requests *without proper validation within the Nimbus request setup*, Nimbus will execute these potentially malicious requests. The vulnerability lies in the direct use of unsanitized input within the Nimbus request.
* **Example:** User input is taken and directly used to form the URL for a Nimbus request to download a file. An attacker provides an internal URL, and Nimbus makes a request to that internal resource.
* **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Validate and Sanitize Input Before Nimbus Usage:**  Before using user input to construct URLs for Nimbus requests, implement strict validation and sanitization.
    * **Use Nimbus's Features to Enforce Allowed Hosts/Paths (if available):** Explore if Nimbus offers any configuration options to restrict the target hosts or paths for network requests.
    * **Avoid Direct URL Construction with User Input in Nimbus Calls:**  Prefer using predefined base URLs and appending validated parameters or using internal logic to determine the target URL before involving Nimbus.
