## Threat: [JavaScript Injection in Web Views (Nimbus-Managed)](./threats/javascript_injection_in_web_views__nimbus-managed_.md)

*   **Threat:**  JavaScript Injection in Web Views (Nimbus-Managed)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code and injects it into a web view *specifically managed by Nimbus components*. This is most likely to occur through a compromised website loaded within the `NIWebController`, or a custom Nimbus component that improperly handles web content or embeds a `UIWebView`/`WKWebView` without sufficient security measures. The attacker leverages the Nimbus component to execute the malicious script.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Theft of user cookies and session tokens, leading to account takeover.
        *   Redirection of the user to phishing sites.
        *   Modification of the web view's content to display false information.
        *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context (specifically, the context provided by the Nimbus web view), potentially accessing sensitive data or device features exposed to that context.
        *   Bypass of application security controls that rely on the web view's integrity.
    *   **Affected Nimbus Component:** `NIWebController`, any custom Nimbus component that utilizes `UIWebView` or `WKWebView` (directly or indirectly and *without proper sanitization*), or any Nimbus component designed to render HTML content that doesn't properly escape or sanitize input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement *extremely rigorous* input validation and sanitization for *all* data displayed within a Nimbus-managed web view. Use a well-vetted and actively maintained HTML sanitization library (e.g., OWASP's AntiSamy or a robust equivalent).  *Never* trust user-supplied input or data from external sources, even if seemingly benign.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a *strict* Content Security Policy (CSP) within the Nimbus-managed web view. This policy should severely restrict the origins from which scripts, styles, and other resources can be loaded. Configure the `WKWebView`'s `configuration.websiteDataStore.httpCookieStore` for secure cookie management.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure that all data displayed in the Nimbus-managed web view is properly encoded for its context (HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding, etc.).
        *   **Avoid Untrusted Content:**  Strongly prefer *not* loading untrusted or external web content within the Nimbus-managed web view. If external links are necessary, open them in the system browser (Safari) instead of within the app's Nimbus-controlled web view.
        *   **Disable JavaScript (If Possible):** If JavaScript is not *absolutely essential* for the Nimbus web view's functionality, disable it entirely. This eliminates the JavaScript injection risk.
        *   **`WKWebView` Preference:**  Always use `WKWebView` instead of the deprecated `UIWebView`. `WKWebView` provides significant security improvements.
        *   **Nimbus-Specific Delegate Monitoring:** Implement the `WKNavigationDelegate` (for `WKWebView`) or `UIWebViewDelegate` (if using the deprecated `UIWebView`) methods *specifically within the Nimbus component* to monitor navigation and resource loading. Block or sanitize suspicious requests *before* they are processed by the web view. This is a crucial Nimbus-specific mitigation.
        *   **Regular Nimbus & WebKit Updates:** Keep both the Nimbus framework and the underlying WebKit engine (through iOS updates) up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Nimbus Network Traffic Interception (Nimbus Networking Components)](./threats/data_leakage_via_nimbus_network_traffic_interception__nimbus_networking_components_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Data Leakage via Nimbus Network Traffic Interception (Nimbus Networking Components)

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic specifically generated by *Nimbus's networking components*. This could involve using a proxy tool or compromising the network. If sensitive data (API keys, user credentials) is transmitted in plain text or with weak encryption *by these Nimbus components*, the attacker can steal this information. The focus here is on the attacker targeting Nimbus's built-in networking capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of API keys used by Nimbus components, leading to unauthorized access to backend services.
        *   Theft of user credentials if handled by Nimbus networking components, enabling account takeover.
        *   Disclosure of sensitive user data transmitted via Nimbus's networking features.
        *   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where the attacker modifies network traffic handled by Nimbus to manipulate the application's behavior.
    *   **Affected Nimbus Component:** `NINetworkImageView`, `NINetworkRequestOperation`, any custom Nimbus component that *directly* uses `NSURLSession` or other networking APIs *and integrates with Nimbus's request/response handling*. The key is that the vulnerability lies in how *Nimbus itself* handles the network communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:**  *Mandatory* use of HTTPS for *all* network communication performed by Nimbus components.  Absolutely no plain HTTP connections should be allowed.
        *   **Certificate Pinning (Nimbus-Specific):** Implement certificate pinning *specifically within the Nimbus components* that handle network requests. This ensures that the Nimbus component only communicates with servers presenting a pre-validated certificate, preventing MITM attacks. This is a critical Nimbus-focused mitigation.
        *   **Strong Encryption:** Use strong encryption protocols and ciphers (TLS 1.3 or higher) within the Nimbus networking components.
        *   **Data Minimization (Nimbus Context):**  Within the Nimbus components, only transmit the *absolute minimum* necessary data over the network. Avoid sending sensitive information if it's not essential for the Nimbus component's function.
        *   **Request Validation (Nimbus-Specific):**  Within the Nimbus components handling network requests, rigorously validate and sanitize *all* data sent in network requests to prevent injection attacks that could manipulate the request or its parameters *before* they are sent.
        *   **Disable Caching of Sensitive Data (Nimbus-Specific):** Configure Nimbus's caching mechanisms (and any underlying networking libraries used *by Nimbus*) to *never* cache sensitive data handled by the Nimbus components.
        *   **App Transport Security (ATS):** Ensure that App Transport Security (ATS) is properly configured in your app's `Info.plist` to enforce secure network connections. While this is a general iOS security measure, it's crucial for protecting Nimbus's network communications.

## Threat: [Debugging Feature Exposure in Production (Nimbus Features)](./threats/debugging_feature_exposure_in_production__nimbus_features_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Debugging Feature Exposure in Production (Nimbus Features)

    *   **Description:** Nimbus-specific debugging features (e.g., network request logging within `NINetworkRequestOperation`, view hierarchy inspection tools provided by Nimbus) are accidentally left enabled in a production build. An attacker with physical access to the device or a compromised device can access these *Nimbus-provided* debugging features to extract sensitive information or understand how the application uses Nimbus internally.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of API keys, user data, and other sensitive information logged by Nimbus's debugging tools.
        *   Disclosure of the application's internal structure and logic, *specifically related to Nimbus component usage*, aiding in vulnerability discovery.
        *   Potential for reverse engineering the application's interaction with Nimbus.
    *   **Affected Nimbus Component:** All Nimbus components, but *particularly* those with built-in debugging capabilities: `NINetworkRequestOperation`, `NINetworkImageView`, `NIDebuggingTools`, `NIViewRecycler`, `NITableViewModel`, and any custom Nimbus components that have debugging logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Conditional Compilation (Nimbus-Specific):** Use preprocessor macros (`#ifdef DEBUG`) to conditionally compile *all* Nimbus-related debugging code. Ensure that *no* Nimbus debugging features are enabled in release builds. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Build Configuration Verification:** Double-check Xcode build settings to ensure that debugging symbols are stripped and optimizations are enabled for release builds. This helps prevent accidental inclusion of debugging code.
        *   **Code Review (Nimbus Focus):**  Conduct regular code reviews with a specific focus on identifying and removing any Nimbus debugging features that might have been accidentally left in production code.
        *   **Automated Checks (Nimbus-Specific):** Implement automated checks (e.g., as part of a CI/CD pipeline) to verify that *no* Nimbus debugging features are enabled in release builds. This could involve searching for specific Nimbus debugging API calls.
