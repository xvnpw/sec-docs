# Attack Surface Analysis for jverkoey/nimbus

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Link Handling in `NIAttributedLabel`](./attack_surfaces/malicious_link_handling_in__niattributedlabel_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of custom URL handling within Nimbus's attributed labels to trigger unintended actions.
*   **Nimbus Contribution:** `NIAttributedLabel` *directly* provides the functionality for custom link handling, creating the vulnerability if misused.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a text message with a seemingly harmless link rendered by `NIAttributedLabel`. The link uses a custom URL scheme (e.g., `myapp://exploit?command=deleteData`) that, when tapped, triggers a function within the app to delete user data.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, unauthorized actions, potential for remote code execution (if the link handler interacts with other vulnerable components).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the actions triggered).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Strict URL Validation:** Rigorous validation of *all* URL components (scheme, host, path, query). Use whitelists for allowed schemes/domains.
        *   **Safe URL Handling:** *Never* directly execute code based on URL parameters. Use a secure intermediary.
        *   **System APIs:** Prefer `SFSafariViewController` or `ASWebAuthenticationSession` for web links to leverage system security.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all input used to construct attributed strings.

## Attack Surface: [Image Decoding Exploits via `NINetworkImageView`](./attack_surfaces/image_decoding_exploits_via__ninetworkimageview_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries used by Nimbus to process maliciously crafted images.
*   **Nimbus Contribution:** `NINetworkImageView` *directly* handles image downloading, caching, and display, making it the entry point.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted PNG image. `NINetworkImageView` downloads and decodes it, triggering a buffer overflow in the underlying library, leading to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, application crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Up-to-Date Libraries:** Ensure Nimbus and image decoding dependencies are current.
        *   **System Frameworks:** Favor system-provided image decoding (e.g., `UIImage`, `UIImageView`) for better maintenance.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider sandboxing the image decoding process.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing on image decoding.
        *   **Image Validation:** Validate basic image properties (dimensions, file type) before decoding.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning in `NINetworkImageView`](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning_in__ninetworkimageview_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious images into the `NINetworkImageView` cache via manipulated network responses.
*   **Nimbus Contribution:** `NINetworkImageView`'s caching mechanism is *directly* the vulnerable component.
*   **Example:** Man-in-the-middle attack on HTTP. Attacker replaces a legitimate image with a malicious one. `NINetworkImageView` caches the malicious image; subsequent requests load the exploit.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (via decoding exploits), display of malicious content, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depends on exploitability of the cached image).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** *Enforce HTTPS* for all image downloads.
        *   **Cache Validation:** Implement strong validation (checksums, digital signatures).
        *   **Isolated Cache:** Use a dedicated, isolated cache for network images.
        *   **Cache Expiration:** Use appropriate cache expiration policies.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Bridge Vulnerabilities in `NIWebController`](./attack_surfaces/javascript_bridge_vulnerabilities_in__niwebcontroller_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of a weakly secured JavaScript bridge in `NIWebController` to execute native code from a compromised web context.
*   **Nimbus Contribution:** `NIWebController` *directly* provides the web view and the JavaScript bridge, creating the attack surface.
*   **Example:** Injected JavaScript in a website loaded in `NIWebController` calls a poorly validated function exposed via the bridge, accessing sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data theft, privilege escalation, security bypass.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Minimize Bridge:** Expose *only* essential functionality.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* input from JavaScript.
        *   **Secure Coding:** Apply secure coding principles to the bridge implementation.
        *   **WKWebView:** Use `WKWebView` (process isolation) instead of older web components.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to restrict JavaScript actions.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Ensure the web view runs in a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Nimbus Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_nimbus_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of the Nimbus framework that contains known vulnerabilities.
*   **Nimbus Contribution:** The vulnerability exists within the framework itself.
*   **Example:** An older version of Nimbus has a known vulnerability in its network image handling. An attacker exploits this vulnerability in an application that hasn't updated Nimbus.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of Nimbus.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (e.g., CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift Package Manager) to track and update dependencies.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor the Nimbus project (GitHub repository, mailing lists, etc.) for security advisories and promptly apply any necessary patches.
