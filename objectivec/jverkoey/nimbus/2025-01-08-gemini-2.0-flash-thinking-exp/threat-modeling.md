# Threat Model Analysis for jverkoey/nimbus

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning](./threats/cache_poisoning.md)

* **Description:** An attacker might manipulate the image download process to replace legitimate cached images with malicious ones. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how Nimbus fetches and caches images, potentially by providing a URL that, when processed by Nimbus, results in a malicious image being stored.
    * **Impact:** Users viewing the affected images could be exposed to misinformation, offensive content, or even be victims of drive-by downloads or other exploits if the malicious image leverages image format vulnerabilities.
    * **Affected Nimbus Component:** `NIImageCache` (specifically the caching mechanism and image retrieval process).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation on image URLs before passing them to Nimbus.
        * Use HTTPS for all image downloads to prevent easily intercepted and replaced content.
        * Consider implementing integrity checks (e.g., checksums) on downloaded images before caching.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Image Downloads](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_image_downloads.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses Nimbus to download images over insecure HTTP connections, an attacker positioned between the application and the image server could intercept and modify the image data in transit before Nimbus caches it. This is a direct consequence of Nimbus's network request handling when not secured.
    * **Impact:** Caching of tampered images, leading to potential misinformation, defacement, or exploitation if the modified image contains malicious content.
    * **Affected Nimbus Component:** `NIImageLoader` (specifically the network request handling).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use HTTPS for image downloads:** This is the primary defense against MitM attacks on image content.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within Nimbus Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_nimbus_library_itself.md)

* **Description:** Like any software, Nimbus might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if they can influence how Nimbus processes image data or manages its internal state. This could involve providing specially crafted image URLs or data that trigger a bug within Nimbus's code.
    * **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to application crashes, memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, or other security breaches directly caused by flaws in the Nimbus library.
    * **Affected Nimbus Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Nimbus updated:** Regularly update to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes provided by the library maintainers.
        * Monitor for security advisories related to the Nimbus library.

## Threat: [Configuration Issues Leading to Insecure Behavior](./threats/configuration_issues_leading_to_insecure_behavior.md)

* **Description:** Developers might misconfigure Nimbus in a way that weakens security. This could involve disabling secure caching mechanisms within Nimbus, or using insecure storage locations that Nimbus interacts with.
    * **Impact:** Increased risk of cache snooping, poisoning, or other attacks due to the insecure configuration of the Nimbus library itself.
    * **Affected Nimbus Component:** Initialization and configuration of `NIImageCache` and related components.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow security best practices when configuring Nimbus, adhering to the official documentation.
        * Perform thorough code reviews to ensure Nimbus is configured securely.
        * Avoid modifying default Nimbus settings to less secure options without a strong justification and understanding of the risks.
