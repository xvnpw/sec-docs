## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Download Process [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_download_process__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Leveraging the application's image download functionality to introduce malicious content.
*   **How it works:**
    *   The application uses the Nimbus library to download images based on URLs.
    *   If the application directly uses URLs provided by users or from untrusted sources without proper validation, an attacker can supply a URL pointing to a malicious file instead of a legitimate image.
    *   Nimbus will then download this malicious file.
    *   The impact depends on the type of malicious file downloaded. It could be malware, an exploit, or a file designed to trick users (e.g., a fake login page).
*   **Critical Node: Download Malicious Content:**  Successfully downloading malicious content is a key step towards compromising the application or the user's device.
*   **Critical Node: Supply Malicious URL:** This is the initial action by the attacker that triggers the download of malicious content. It highlights the vulnerability of directly using untrusted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cache Mechanism [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cache_mechanism__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the application's image cache to introduce malicious content.
*   **How it works:**
    *   The application uses Nimbus to cache downloaded images for performance.
    *   **Critical Node: Overwrite Cached Files:** If the application's cache directory has insecure permissions (e.g., world-writable), an attacker with local access to the device or server can directly overwrite the legitimate cached image files with malicious ones.
    *   When the application later retrieves the image from the cache, it will load the malicious content instead of the expected image.
    *   This can be used for various attacks, such as serving fake content, phishing attempts, or even exploiting vulnerabilities if the application processes the cached image in a vulnerable way.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Exploiting insecure configurations made by the developer when using the Nimbus library.
*   **How it works:**
    *   **Critical Node: Misconfiguration by Developer:** Developers might make mistakes when setting up the application and the Nimbus library.
    *   **Critical Node: Insecure Cache Location:** A common misconfiguration is storing the image cache in a location with overly permissive access rights (e.g., a world-writable directory).
    *   If the cache is stored in an insecure location, an attacker with local access can directly manipulate the cached files, leading to cache poisoning attacks as described in the previous high-risk path.
