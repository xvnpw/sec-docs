# Attack Surface Analysis for jverkoey/nimbus

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Image Downloads](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_image_downloads.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the image server, potentially injecting malicious content.
    * **How Nimbus Contributes:** Nimbus is responsible for fetching images from provided URLs. If HTTPS is not enforced or certificate validation is weak, Nimbus will blindly download content from the attacker's server.
    * **Example:** An attacker on a shared Wi-Fi network intercepts the download of a profile picture. They replace the legitimate image with an image containing malware or offensive content.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Malware Infection:** If the injected content is an executable or triggers an exploit in the image processing library.
        * **Data Corruption:** Replacing legitimate images with incorrect ones.
        * **Reputation Damage:** Displaying offensive or inappropriate content to users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all image URLs use HTTPS.
            * **Implement Proper Certificate Pinning:**  Verify the server's SSL certificate to prevent MitM attacks even if a Certificate Authority is compromised.
            * **Use Secure Network Communication Libraries:** Ensure the underlying network libraries used by Nimbus (or the application) are up-to-date and secure.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Server-Side Vulnerabilities via Image URLs](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_server-side_vulnerabilities_via_image_urls.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious image URLs that, when processed by the image server, trigger vulnerabilities.
    * **How Nimbus Contributes:** Nimbus fetches and displays images based on URLs provided by the application. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate these URLs, Nimbus will unknowingly send malicious requests to the server.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects a URL like `https://example.com/image?file=../../../etc/passwd` (path traversal) or `https://vulnerable-server.com/?command=delete_all_data` (SSRF) into a profile picture field. Nimbus fetches this URL, potentially exposing sensitive files or triggering server-side actions.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive files or data on the image server.
        * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Using the image server to make requests to internal resources or external services.
        * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In severe cases, exploiting vulnerabilities might lead to RCE on the image server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided or dynamically generated image URLs before passing them to Nimbus.

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into the Nimbus image cache, which is then served to the application as a legitimate image.
    * **How Nimbus Contributes:** Nimbus stores downloaded images in a local cache. If an attacker can intercept the download process (MitM) or gain access to the cache directory, they can replace legitimate images with malicious ones.
    * **Example:** An attacker performing a MitM attack replaces a user's avatar in the cache with an image containing an embedded script. When the application displays the avatar from the cache, the script might execute.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the malicious image contains embedded scripts that are executed by the application's image rendering mechanism.
        * **Information Disclosure:** Displaying manipulated images to mislead users or reveal sensitive information.
        * **Reputation Damage:** Displaying offensive or inappropriate content.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Enforce HTTPS and Certificate Pinning (as above):**  Prevent MitM attacks, which are a primary vector for cache poisoning.
            * **Verify Image Integrity:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of cached images (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
