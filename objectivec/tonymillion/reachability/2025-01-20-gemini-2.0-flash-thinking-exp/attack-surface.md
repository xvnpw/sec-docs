# Attack Surface Analysis for tonymillion/reachability

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Application Logic Based on Reachability](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_application_logic_based_on_reachability.md)

* **Description:** The application's behavior or logic is directly dependent on the reported network reachability status.
    * **How Reachability Contributes:** The `reachability` library provides the signal that triggers these logic changes. If this signal can be manipulated, the application's behavior can be influenced.
    * **Example:** An attacker could potentially block network access in a way that the `reachability` library still reports a connection (e.g., a captive portal scenario before authentication). The application might then attempt network operations that will fail, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior. Conversely, an attacker might simulate a lack of connectivity to prevent certain actions.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service (by forcing repeated failed attempts), data inconsistency (if synchronization is affected), bypassing security checks that rely on network availability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for network operations, regardless of the reported reachability status.
            * Avoid making critical security decisions solely based on the `reachability` status. Implement secondary checks or confirmations.
            * Design the application to gracefully handle temporary network interruptions and avoid relying on instantaneous reachability changes.
        * **Users:**
            * Be aware that network connectivity can be unreliable and that applications should handle this gracefully.
            * Report applications that exhibit unexpected behavior or errors related to network connectivity.
