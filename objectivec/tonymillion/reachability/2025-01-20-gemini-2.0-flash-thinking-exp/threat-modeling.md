# Threat Model Analysis for tonymillion/reachability

## Threat: [Spoofing Network Connectivity Status](./threats/spoofing_network_connectivity_status.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges on the device could manipulate the underlying operating system's network interfaces or routing tables to falsely report a specific network connectivity status to the application. This involves directly influencing the information that the `Reachability` library relies upon to determine network status.

**Impact:** The application might make incorrect decisions based on the spoofed network state. For example, it might attempt to upload sensitive data over an unsecure connection believing it's on a trusted network, or it might fail to perform necessary network operations thinking there is no connectivity.

**Affected Component:**
*   `Reachability` module's core functionality for fetching network status.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust error handling and validation within the application to handle unexpected network states, regardless of what `Reachability` reports.
*   Avoid solely relying on `Reachability`'s reported status for critical security decisions.
*   Consider using multiple methods to verify network connectivity if the application's security depends on it, rather than solely trusting `Reachability`.

## Threat: [Tampering with Reachability Library Code](./threats/tampering_with_reachability_library_code.md)

**Description:** If an attacker gains access to the application's installation directory or runtime environment, they could directly modify the `Reachability` library's code. This could involve injecting malicious code, altering the logic for reporting network status within the library itself, or disabling the library entirely.

**Impact:**  A tampered `Reachability` library could provide false information about network connectivity, leading to incorrect application behavior or enabling further attacks. Malicious code injected into `Reachability` could compromise the application's security and potentially the user's device.

**Affected Component:**
*   The entire `Reachability` library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement code signing and integrity checks for the application and its dependencies, specifically including the `Reachability` library.
*   Use secure storage mechanisms for the application and its libraries to prevent unauthorized modification of the `Reachability` library.
*   Employ runtime application self-protection (RASP) techniques to detect and prevent code tampering of the `Reachability` library.
*   Regularly update the `Reachability` library to benefit from security patches and improvements that might address vulnerabilities within the library itself.

## Threat: [Incorrect Handling of Reachability Callbacks Leading to Security Issues](./threats/incorrect_handling_of_reachability_callbacks_leading_to_security_issues.md)

**Description:** Developers might implement the logic that handles `Reachability`'s network status change notifications incorrectly, creating vulnerabilities. This directly involves how the application interacts with and responds to the information provided by `Reachability`. For example, they might initiate sensitive network operations without properly checking the connection status, assuming a connection is always available when a "connected" event is received from `Reachability`.

**Impact:** This could lead to insecure data transmission, exposure of sensitive information over unsecure connections, or application errors, all stemming from a misinterpretation or misuse of `Reachability`'s output.

**Affected Component:**
*   The application's callback functions or event listeners that process network status change notifications *from* `Reachability`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test the application's logic for handling network status changes received from `Reachability`.
*   Implement robust checks for network connectivity before performing sensitive operations, even after receiving a "connected" notification from `Reachability`.
*   Follow secure coding practices when implementing network-related functionality that relies on `Reachability`'s information.
*   Avoid making assumptions about the network state based solely on `Reachability`'s notifications.

## Threat: [Over-Reliance on Reachability for Security Decisions](./threats/over-reliance_on_reachability_for_security_decisions.md)

**Description:** Developers might rely solely on `Reachability`'s reported network status for making critical security decisions, such as enabling or disabling certain features or allowing access to specific resources. This directly involves trusting the output of the `Reachability` library as the sole source of truth for network connectivity in security-sensitive contexts.

**Impact:** Attackers could bypass security controls by manipulating the perceived network status reported by `Reachability`. For example, an application might disable security features believing it's on a trusted network based on `Reachability`'s report, when the status is actually spoofed.

**Affected Component:**
*   The application's security logic that directly depends on the output of the `Reachability` library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid solely relying on `Reachability`'s output for critical security decisions.
*   Implement multiple layers of security and validation mechanisms, not just relying on `Reachability`.
*   Use `Reachability` as one factor among others when making security-related decisions, and always validate its output with other checks.
*   Consider the potential for network status spoofing when designing security controls that interact with `Reachability`'s reported status.
