# Threat Model Analysis for tonymillion/reachability

## Threat: [Spoofed Reachability Status (High Severity Scenario)](./threats/spoofed_reachability_status__high_severity_scenario_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with control over the network path (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle on a Wi-Fi network, compromised network infrastructure) actively manipulates network responses to deceive the `reachability` library.  Specifically, they could intercept and modify network signals (like ICMP responses, DNS replies, or TCP handshake packets) to falsely indicate a target host is reachable when it is actually unreachable, or vice versa. This deception is crafted to directly mislead the `reachability` library's network status determination.
*   **Impact:** If critical application functionality *solely* depends on the reachability status reported by the library, spoofing can lead to severe consequences. For example:
    *   **Data Corruption/Loss:** Application might attempt to write data to a service falsely reported as reachable, leading to data loss if the service is actually unavailable or data written to the wrong location.
    *   **Critical Function Failure:** Core application features that rely on network connectivity to specific services might fail silently or unexpectedly, leading to application malfunction or instability.
    *   **Bypass of Security Controls:** In scenarios where reachability checks are used as a rudimentary form of access control or service discovery, spoofing could allow unauthorized access or connection to unintended services.
*   **Affected Reachability Component:** `Reachability` module's core network checking functionality, specifically the network status determination logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when critical application logic directly and solely relies on reachability status)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Sole Reliance:**  **Crucially, do not rely solely on `reachability` checks for critical decision-making.**  Reachability status should be treated as a hint, not a definitive truth.
    *   **Application-Level Verification (Mandatory for Critical Functions):** For any critical operation dependent on network connectivity, *always* supplement `reachability` checks with robust application-level verification. This means attempting to perform the actual operation (e.g., API call, data transfer) and handling failures gracefully.
    *   **End-to-End Security:** Implement end-to-end encryption and authentication (e.g., TLS/SSL) to protect communication channels. While this doesn't directly prevent reachability spoofing, it secures the data in transit *after* reachability is (potentially falsely) confirmed.
    *   **Network Security Best Practices:** Employ general network security best practices to reduce the likelihood of network manipulation (e.g., secure network configurations, VPNs for sensitive communications, network segmentation).

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Reachability Library (Critical Severity)](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_reachability_library__critical_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** The `tonymillion/reachability` library itself is compromised at the source. This could occur through malicious code injection into the library's repository on GitHub, during the release process, or via compromise of the distribution channel (e.g., if distributed through a package manager). An attacker with control over the library's code can manipulate its behavior in arbitrary ways, including:
    *   **Manipulating Reachability Results:**  Force the library to always report "reachable" or "unreachable" regardless of actual network conditions, disrupting application logic.
    *   **Introducing Backdoors:** Inject malicious code that allows remote access to the application or the system it runs on.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Silently exfiltrate sensitive data from the application or the environment.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Cause the application to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:**  This is a critical threat as it can lead to complete compromise of applications using the vulnerable library. Impacts include:
    *   **Full Application Compromise:** Attackers gain control over application functionality and data.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Sensitive data can be stolen.
    *   **System Takeover:**  In severe cases, attackers could gain control of the underlying system.
    *   **Reputational Damage:**  Compromise of applications can severely damage the reputation of the developers and organizations using them.
*   **Affected Reachability Component:** The entire `Reachability` library codebase and its distribution mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (potential for complete application compromise and severe data breaches)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Dependency Management:** Implement a robust software composition analysis (SCA) process.
    *   **Dependency Scanning (Automated):** Use automated dependency scanning tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in `reachability` and all other dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates (Proactive):**  Keep the `reachability` library and all dependencies updated to the latest versions promptly to patch vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories for the library and its ecosystem.
    *   **Integrity Verification (Distribution):** Verify the integrity of the library package upon download. Use checksums or package signing provided by trusted sources to ensure the library has not been tampered with during distribution.
    *   **Code Review (If Possible):**  If feasible and resources permit, conduct security code reviews of the `reachability` library, especially if using it in highly sensitive applications.
    *   **Vendor Due Diligence (For Commercial Alternatives):** If considering commercial reachability solutions (if available), perform thorough vendor due diligence to assess their security practices and incident response capabilities.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Incident Response:** Implement robust security monitoring to detect any anomalous behavior in applications using the `reachability` library. Have a well-defined incident response plan in case of a suspected compromise.
