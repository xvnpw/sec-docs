# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `reachability`, provides a network reachability checking tool. The primary business goal for such a tool is to ensure the reliability and availability of network services and infrastructure. Businesses rely on network connectivity for critical operations, and downtime can lead to significant financial and reputational damage.

- Business Priorities:
  - Ensure high availability of critical network services.
  - Minimize downtime and service disruptions.
  - Provide timely alerts for network connectivity issues.
  - Enable efficient network troubleshooting and diagnostics.

- Business Goals:
  - Proactively monitor network reachability of key infrastructure components and services.
  - Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) for network outages.
  - Improve overall network stability and performance.
  - Provide data-driven insights into network health and trends.

- Business Risks:
  - False negatives: The tool fails to detect an actual network outage, leading to prolonged downtime and service disruption.
  - False positives: The tool incorrectly reports a network outage, causing unnecessary alerts and wasted resources on investigation.
  - Data breaches: If the tool collects and stores sensitive network information (e.g., IP addresses, network configurations) and this data is compromised.
  - Availability of the reachability tool itself: If the monitoring tool becomes unavailable, it cannot perform its function, leading to a blind spot in network monitoring.
  - Performance impact: The reachability checks might consume excessive network resources, impacting the performance of monitored systems.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation on target hostnames/IP addresses to prevent command injection or other input-based vulnerabilities. (Implemented in code, needs review).
  - security control: Principle of least privilege for the tool's execution environment. (Deployment dependent, needs definition).
  - security control: Logging of reachability checks and any errors encountered. (Implemented in code, needs review).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for information disclosure if error messages or logs contain sensitive network details. (Mitigation: Review logs and error handling).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on underlying network security for the reachability checks themselves. (Mitigation: Ensure network infrastructure is secured).

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement authentication and authorization for accessing the reachability tool's configuration and results, especially if exposed via an API or web interface.
  - security control: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit if the tool stores or transmits network information.
  - security control: Regularly scan the codebase for vulnerabilities using SAST and DAST tools.
  - security control: Implement a secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) including security reviews and testing.
  - security control: Automate security checks in the build pipeline (e.g., linters, vulnerability scanners).
  - security control: Implement monitoring and alerting for the reachability tool itself to ensure its availability and integrity.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: If the reachability tool is exposed via an interface (API, web UI), it must require authentication to prevent unauthorized access to configuration and results.
    - Requirement: Authentication mechanism should be strong and resistant to common attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).

  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific functionalities and data based on user roles.
    - Requirement: Ensure that only authorized users can modify the tool's configuration or access sensitive monitoring data.

  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All inputs, especially target hostnames/IP addresses and ports, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, DNS rebinding).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied on both client-side and server-side (if applicable).

  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If sensitive network data is stored or transmitted, it must be encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys and certificates.
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication if the tool exposes a web interface or API.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Monitoring network infrastructure availability.
  - Alerting on network outages to minimize downtime.
  - Network troubleshooting and diagnostics.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Configuration data (target hosts, ports, check intervals): Low to Medium sensitivity. Exposure could reveal monitoring targets.
  - Reachability check results (logs, alerts): Low to Medium sensitivity. Could reveal network status and potential vulnerabilities if detailed error messages are exposed.
  - Potentially, if authentication is implemented, user credentials: High sensitivity. Must be protected with strong encryption and access controls.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Is there a need for user authentication and authorization for the Reachability Tool? If yes, what level of access control is required?
  - Is there a requirement to store historical reachability data? If yes, what is the retention period and sensitivity of this data?
  - What are the performance requirements for the Reachability Tool? How many targets need to be monitored and at what frequency?
  - What alerting channels are required (e.g., email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty)?
  - What is the intended deployment environment (cloud, on-premises, hybrid)?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the Reachability Tool needs to adhere to?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve network availability and reduce downtime. The organization values proactive network monitoring.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Currently, security controls are basic, focusing on input validation and logging. There is a need to enhance security posture, especially around authentication, authorization, and secure development practices.
  - DESIGN: The Reachability Tool will be deployed as a containerized application in a cloud environment. It will have a CLI/API interface and integrate with existing log management and alerting systems. The build process will be automated using CI/CD and include basic security checks.
