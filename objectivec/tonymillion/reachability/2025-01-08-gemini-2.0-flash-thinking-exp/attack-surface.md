# Attack Surface Analysis for tonymillion/reachability

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and DNS Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__and_dns_spoofing.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts network communication or manipulates DNS responses to redirect the library's probes.
    * **How Reachability Contributes:** The library relies on DNS resolution to determine the IP address of the target host. If DNS is compromised, `reachability` might probe a malicious server, leading the application to believe it has connectivity when it doesn't.
    * **Example:** An application uses `reachability` to check if its backend API is available. An attacker on the same network performs a DNS spoofing attack, causing `reachability` to resolve the backend's domain to the attacker's server. The application incorrectly reports connectivity.
    * **Impact:** The application may operate under false assumptions of network connectivity, potentially leading to data breaches, incorrect functionality, or denial of service if it relies on this false positive.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement TLS/SSL:** Ensure all communication with the target host (beyond just the reachability check) uses HTTPS to protect data in transit. This doesn't prevent the spoofing of the *reachability* probe itself, but secures subsequent communication.
        * **Verify Server Certificates:**  If the application interacts with the probed server, implement proper certificate validation to prevent connecting to impersonated servers.
        * **Consider DNSSEC:** While not directly a mitigation for the application, using DNSSEC for the target domain can reduce the risk of DNS spoofing.
        * **Implement Fallback Mechanisms:** Don't rely solely on `reachability` for critical decisions. Implement secondary checks or timeouts.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities within the Reachability Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_within_the_reachability_library_itself.md)

* **Description:**  Undiscovered security flaws exist within the `reachability` library's code.
    * **How Reachability Contributes:** As a third-party dependency, any vulnerabilities in `reachability` directly affect the application using it.
    * **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in how `reachability` handles network responses. An attacker could craft a malicious network response that triggers this overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, arbitrary code execution, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep the Library Updated:** Regularly update the `reachability` library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities in the `reachability` library or its dependencies.
        * **Consider Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to scan the application's dependencies, including `reachability`, for potential vulnerabilities.
