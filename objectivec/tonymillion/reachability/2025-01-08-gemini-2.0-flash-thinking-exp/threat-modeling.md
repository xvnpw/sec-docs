# Threat Model Analysis for tonymillion/reachability

## Threat: [False Network Status Reporting](./threats/false_network_status_reporting.md)

**Description:** An attacker, by manipulating the underlying network or operating system environment in a way that specifically targets the mechanisms used by the `reachability` library, could cause it to report an incorrect network status (e.g., reporting connected when there is no internet access, or vice-versa). This focuses on manipulation that directly impacts how `reachability` determines connectivity, rather than just general network interference.

**Impact:** The application might make incorrect decisions based on the false network status. For example, it might attempt to send data when offline, leading to errors or data loss, or it might not attempt to connect when a connection is available, hindering functionality.

**Affected Component:** Network monitoring logic within the `reachability` library (the specific mechanism it uses to determine connectivity).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement application-level checks to verify network connectivity beyond relying solely on `reachability`.
* Implement retry mechanisms for network operations that fail.
* Consider using server-side checks for critical network-dependent functionalities.
* Stay updated with the latest version of `reachability` as it might contain fixes for vulnerabilities related to status detection.

## Threat: [Incorrect Status Reporting due to Bugs in `reachability`](./threats/incorrect_status_reporting_due_to_bugs_in__reachability_.md)

**Description:** The `reachability` library itself might contain bugs or edge cases in its code that lead to incorrect reporting of network status under specific, legitimate network conditions. This is a vulnerability within the library's implementation.

**Impact:** The application might behave unexpectedly due to the incorrect network status reported by the library, leading to functionality breakdowns or a degraded user experience.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the `reachability` library's core logic responsible for determining network connectivity.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest version of the `reachability` library to benefit from bug fixes.
* Thoroughly test the application's behavior under various network conditions, including edge cases, to identify potential discrepancies in `reachability`'s reporting.
* Consider contributing to the `reachability` project by reporting identified bugs or submitting fixes.
* For critical applications, explore alternative, well-vetted network reachability solutions or implement custom checks if the risk of library bugs is a significant concern.
