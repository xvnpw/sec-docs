# Attack Tree Analysis for tonymillion/reachability

Objective: Disrupt Application Functionality or Leak Sensitive Information by manipulating or misinterpreting network reachability status reported by the `tonymillion/reachability` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Reachability Status Reported by Library](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_reachability_status_reported_by_library.md)

*   **Manipulate Reachability Status Reported by Library:** The attacker actively interferes with the network or the device to make the library report an incorrect reachability status.

## Attack Tree Path: [Spoof Network Responses](./attack_tree_paths/spoof_network_responses.md)

    *   **Spoof Network Responses:**

## Attack Tree Path: [DNS Spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/dns_spoofing.md)

        *   **DNS Spoofing:** **Critical Node**
            *   **Description:** The attacker controls a DNS server or compromises the DNS resolution process to redirect the application to a malicious or non-existent server. `reachability` might report a host as reachable (because DNS resolved), but the application can't actually connect to the *intended* service.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Block Network Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/block_network_traffic.md)

    *   **Block Network Traffic:** **Critical Node**

## Attack Tree Path: [ICMP Redirect](./attack_tree_paths/icmp_redirect.md)

        *   ICMP Redirect:
            *   **Description:** The attacker sends ICMP redirect messages to reroute traffic away from intended destination.
            *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
            *   **Impact:** Medium
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [TCP/UDP Blocking](./attack_tree_paths/tcpudp_blocking.md)

        *   **TCP/UDP Blocking:** **Critical Node** [HIGH RISK]
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses a firewall, router, or other network device to block TCP or UDP traffic to the target host or port. This is a very common and effective way to make a service appear unreachable.
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High
            *   **Effort:** Very Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
