# Attack Tree Analysis for ccgus/fmdb

Objective: Compromise application data integrity, confidentiality, or availability by exploiting FMDB vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application via FMDB **(Critical Node)**
    * Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities **(Critical Node)**
        * Direct SQL Injection
            * Malicious Input in Query Parameters **(Critical Node)**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via FMDB -> Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities -> Direct SQL Injection -> Malicious Input in Query Parameters:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_fmdb_-_exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_-_direct_sql_injection_-_mal_f2276193.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL code within user-supplied input fields or parameters that are directly incorporated into SQL queries executed by the application using FMDB. Due to the lack of proper input sanitization or the absence of parameterized queries, the database interprets the attacker's input as executable SQL commands.

    * **Consequences:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
        * **Data Breach:**  The attacker can retrieve sensitive data stored in the database.
        * **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data, potentially corrupting the application's state or causing denial of service.
        * **Privilege Escalation:** In some database configurations, the attacker might be able to execute commands with higher privileges than the application's database user.
        * **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** In rare cases, if the database system or enabled extensions allow it, the attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via FMDB:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_fmdb.md)

* **Significance:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of FMDB vulnerabilities will lead to the compromise of the application in some form. This node represents the overall objective and highlights the importance of securing FMDB interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Significance:** This represents the most significant and likely attack vector against applications using FMDB if proper precautions are not taken. SQL injection is a well-understood and prevalent vulnerability. Successful exploitation provides significant control over the database and the application's data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Input in Query Parameters:](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_input_in_query_parameters.md)

* **Significance:** This is the most common and easily exploitable entry point for SQL injection attacks. When applications directly embed user-provided data into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, it creates a direct pathway for attackers to inject malicious SQL code. This node represents the specific weakness in the application's code that attackers will target.
