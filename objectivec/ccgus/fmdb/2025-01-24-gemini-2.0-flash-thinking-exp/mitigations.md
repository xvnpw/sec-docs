## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) with fmdb](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__prepared_statements__with_fmdb.md)

### 1. Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) with fmdb

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) with fmdb
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify fmdb query locations:** Review your code and pinpoint all instances where you are using `fmdb` methods to execute SQL queries (e.g., `executeQuery:`, `executeUpdate:`).
    2.  **Replace string formatting with `?` placeholders:**  Instead of building SQL queries by concatenating strings with user input, rewrite your queries to use `?` placeholders for dynamic values within the SQL string itself.
    3.  **Use `fmdb` argument array methods:**  Employ `fmdb` methods that accept an array of arguments, such as `executeQuery:withArgumentsInArray:` or `executeUpdate:withArgumentsInArray:`. Pass user-provided data as elements in this array, corresponding to the `?` placeholders in your query. `fmdb` will handle proper escaping and quoting of these arguments before sending them to SQLite.
    4.  **Example (Secure fmdb usage):**
        ```objectivec
        NSString *userInput = /* ... user input ... */;
        NSString *sql = @"SELECT * FROM items WHERE itemName = ?";
        FMResultSet *results = [db executeQuery:sql withArgumentsInArray:@[userInput]];
        ```
    5.  **Avoid string formatting for SQL (Insecure fmdb usage - DO NOT DO THIS):**
        ```objectivec
        NSString *userInput = /* ... user input ... */;
        NSString *sql = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"SELECT * FROM items WHERE itemName = '%@'", userInput]; // Vulnerable to SQL Injection
        FMResultSet *results = [db executeQuery:sql]; // Insecure!
        ```
    6.  **Test thoroughly:** Ensure all database interactions using `fmdb` are converted to use parameterized queries and are functioning correctly.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):**  Directly prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities that arise from unsafely incorporating user input into SQL queries when using `fmdb`. This is the most critical threat mitigated by this strategy in the context of `fmdb`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High risk reduction. Parameterized queries are the primary and most effective way to eliminate SQL injection risks when using `fmdb`.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Parameterized queries are used in some newer data retrieval functions within the `DataManager` class, specifically when fetching user-specific data using `fmdb`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Legacy code sections:** Older parts of the codebase, particularly in the `ReportGenerator` module, still use string formatting to construct SQL queries with `fmdb`. These sections need to be refactored to use parameterized queries.
    *   **Dynamic query construction:**  Instances where SQL queries are dynamically built based on complex logic within the application using `fmdb` might still rely on string manipulation instead of parameterized approaches. These need review and conversion.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep fmdb Library Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_fmdb_library_updated.md)

### 2. Keep fmdb Library Updated

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep fmdb Library Updated
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor fmdb releases:** Regularly check the [fmdb GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb) for new releases, bug fixes, and security updates. Pay attention to release notes and any security advisories.
    2.  **Update dependency:**  When a new stable version of `fmdb` is available, update your project's dependency management configuration (e.g., Podfile for CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager manifest) to use the latest version.
    3.  **Test after update:** After updating `fmdb`, thoroughly test your application, especially database-related functionalities, to ensure compatibility and that the update hasn't introduced any regressions or broken existing features that rely on `fmdb`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in fmdb (Medium to High Severity - depending on vulnerability):** Addresses potential security vulnerabilities that might be discovered and fixed in the `fmdb` library itself. While `fmdb` is a relatively thin wrapper, bugs or vulnerabilities could still exist in its code or its interaction with SQLite.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in fmdb:** Medium to High risk reduction. Depends on the severity of any vulnerabilities patched in `fmdb` updates. Proactive updates minimize the window of exposure to known `fmdb` vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** The project uses a dependency manager (e.g., CocoaPods) which facilitates updating dependencies like `fmdb`. However, the update process is not consistently proactive.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated update checks:**  There is no automated system or scheduled process to regularly check for and prompt for `fmdb` updates. Updates are often performed reactively or during major version upgrades, potentially lagging behind the latest secure versions of `fmdb`. A more proactive approach to monitoring and applying `fmdb` updates is needed.
