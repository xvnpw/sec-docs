## Attack Tree Path: [Root Goal: Compromise Application Data and/or Functionality via FMDB Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/root_goal_compromise_application_data_andor_functionality_via_fmdb_exploitation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. Attackers aim to leverage weaknesses in how the application uses FMDB to gain unauthorized access to data or disrupt application functionality.
*   **Impact:** Catastrophic - Full compromise of application, data breach, data loss, application downtime, reputational damage.
*   **Mitigation Focus:**  Address all underlying high-risk paths to prevent achieving this root goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries executed via FMDB. This is possible when user-provided input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Data breach, data modification, data deletion, application logic bypass, potential for further system compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Mandatory Parameterized Queries:**  Always use parameterized queries provided by FMDB for all SQL operations involving user input. This is the primary and most effective defense.
    *   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** Implement input validation to restrict the type and format of user input, reducing the attack surface.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database):** Grant minimal database permissions to the application's database user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsanitized User Input in SQL Queries](./attack_tree_paths/unsanitized_user_input_in_sql_queries.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the root cause of SQL Injection. Developers fail to sanitize or parameterize user input before using it in SQL queries constructed with FMDB.
*   **Impact:** N/A - This is a vulnerability condition that leads to SQL Injection.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Code Review and Training:** Educate developers on SQL Injection risks and secure coding practices. Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and fix instances of unsanitized input in SQL queries.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in the codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration (via SQL Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration__via_sql_injection_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Successful SQL Injection is used to execute queries designed to extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Data breach, loss of confidentiality, regulatory compliance violations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Prevent SQL Injection (Primary):**  Effectively mitigating SQL Injection vulnerabilities is the primary defense against data exfiltration via this vector.
    *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Monitoring:** Implement monitoring systems to detect and alert on unusual database activity or large data transfers that could indicate data exfiltration.
    *   **Minimize Stored Sensitive Data:** Reduce the amount of sensitive data stored in the database if possible, or implement data masking/tokenization techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Modification/Deletion (via SQL Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/data_modificationdeletion__via_sql_injection_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successful SQL Injection is used to execute queries designed to modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues or application malfunction.
*   **Impact:** Significant to Critical - Data corruption, data loss, application instability, denial of service, business disruption.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Prevent SQL Injection (Primary):**  Effectively mitigating SQL Injection vulnerabilities is the primary defense against data modification/deletion via this vector.
    *   **Data Integrity Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to detect unauthorized data modifications or deletions. Use database triggers, checksums, or audit logs to track changes.
    *   **Regular Backups and Recovery Plan:** Maintain regular database backups and have a robust recovery plan to restore data in case of malicious modification or deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Database File Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_database_file_handling.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain direct access to the SQLite database file on the file system due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities, bypassing the application and FMDB layer.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Direct access to all database data, potential for data breach, data modification, data deletion, and complete compromise of database contents.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Secure File Permissions:**  Implement strict file permissions on the SQLite database file. Ensure it is only readable and writable by the application's user/process. Avoid world-readable or group-readable permissions.
    *   **Restrict File System Access:** Limit access to the file system where the database is stored.
    *   **Database File Location Obfuscation (Secondary):** Store the database file in a non-predictable location, although this should not be relied upon as a primary security measure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure File Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_file_permissions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The SQLite database file is configured with overly permissive file permissions, allowing unauthorized users or processes to access it directly.
*   **Impact:** N/A - This is a configuration vulnerability that leads to Insecure Database File Handling.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Automated Permission Checks:** Implement automated scripts or tools to regularly check and enforce correct file permissions on the database file.
    *   **Secure Deployment Practices:**  Establish secure deployment procedures that include setting correct file permissions as a standard step.

## Attack Tree Path: [Database File Stored with World-Readable or Group-Readable Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/database_file_stored_with_world-readable_or_group-readable_permissions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically, the database file is configured to be readable by "world" (all users) or a broad "group" of users, making it easily accessible to attackers who gain access to the system.
*   **Impact:** N/A - This is a specific instance of Insecure File Permissions.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System):** Apply the principle of least privilege to file permissions. Grant only the necessary access to the application's user/process.
    *   **Regular Permission Audits:** Conduct regular audits of file permissions, specifically for the database file, to identify and correct overly permissive settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration (Direct File Access)](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration__direct_file_access_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers who have gained direct access to the database file (due to insecure file handling) copy the file to exfiltrate its contents.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Data breach, loss of confidentiality, regulatory compliance violations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Prevent Insecure File Handling (Primary):**  Effectively securing database file handling is the primary defense against data exfiltration via direct file access.
    *   **File Access Monitoring:** Monitor file access logs for unusual access patterns to the database file.
    *   **Encryption at Rest (Advanced):** Consider encrypting the database file at rest. This adds a layer of protection even if the file is accessed directly, as the attacker would need the decryption key.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Modification (Direct File Access)](./attack_tree_paths/data_modification__direct_file_access_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers who have gained direct access to the database file modify the file contents directly, potentially corrupting data or injecting malicious data. This requires knowledge of the SQLite file format.
*   **Impact:** Significant to Critical - Data corruption, data loss, application instability, potential for backdoors or malicious data injection.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Prevent Insecure File Handling (Primary):** Effectively securing database file handling is the primary defense against data modification via direct file access.
    *   **Data Integrity Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms to detect unauthorized data modifications. Use database triggers, checksums, or file integrity monitoring tools.
    *   **Regular Backups and Recovery Plan:** Maintain regular database backups and have a robust recovery plan to restore data in case of malicious modification.
