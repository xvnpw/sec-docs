# Attack Surface Analysis for ccgus/fmdb

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in application code that uses `fmdb` to construct SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code. This manipulates the intended query logic executed by `fmdb` against the SQLite database.
*   **How fmdb Contributes:** `fmdb` provides methods to execute SQL queries. If developers use string formatting or concatenation to build these queries with unsanitized user input *before* passing them to `fmdb`'s execution methods, `fmdb` becomes the tool that executes the injected malicious SQL. `fmdb` itself doesn't introduce the injection vulnerability, but insecure usage patterns with `fmdb` directly enable it.
*   **Example:**  An application uses `fmdb` to execute a query built like: `NSString *sql = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"SELECT * FROM items WHERE name = '%@'", userInput]; [db executeQuery:sql];`. If `userInput` is crafted as `' OR '1'='1' --`, `fmdb` will execute `SELECT * FROM items WHERE name = '' OR '1'='1' --'`, bypassing the intended filtering and potentially exposing all items.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive data), data modification, data deletion, authentication bypass, privilege escalation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Use Parameterized Queries with fmdb:**  Always utilize `fmdb`'s parameterized query methods (e.g., `executeQuery:withArgumentsInArray:`, `executeUpdate:withArgumentsInArray:`) and pass user inputs as arguments using `?` placeholders. This ensures `fmdb` treats user input as data, not executable SQL code.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):** While parameterization is the primary defense, still validate and sanitize user input *before* even passing it to `fmdb` as arguments. This provides an extra layer of protection against unexpected data or encoding issues.

## Attack Surface: [SQLite Vulnerabilities (Exposed via fmdb)](./attack_surfaces/sqlite_vulnerabilities__exposed_via_fmdb_.md)

*   **Description:**  `fmdb` relies on the underlying SQLite library. Critical vulnerabilities within the specific SQLite version linked with `fmdb` can be exploited through application interactions facilitated by `fmdb`.  Attackers can craft inputs or trigger application flows that cause `fmdb` to interact with SQLite in a way that exposes these underlying SQLite vulnerabilities.
*   **How fmdb Contributes:** `fmdb` acts as the interface to SQLite.  If the linked SQLite library has vulnerabilities, any operation performed through `fmdb` that triggers the vulnerable code path in SQLite becomes an attack vector. `fmdb` doesn't create the SQLite vulnerabilities, but it provides the means for the application to interact with the vulnerable SQLite code.
*   **Example:** A known remote code execution vulnerability exists in a specific older version of SQLite related to handling of certain SQL functions. If an application using `fmdb` and this vulnerable SQLite version processes user-provided SQL (even indirectly through application logic), an attacker could craft input that, when processed by `fmdb` and passed to SQLite, triggers the vulnerable function and allows remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, information disclosure, potentially full system compromise depending on the SQLite vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain Up-to-Date SQLite via fmdb Dependencies:**  Ensure the `fmdb` dependency in your project is configured to use the latest stable and patched version of SQLite. Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security advisories related to SQLite.
    *   **Dependency Management and Auditing:** Use robust dependency management tools to track and manage `fmdb` and its SQLite dependency. Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider Static Analysis and Fuzzing (Advanced):** For high-security applications, employ static analysis and fuzzing techniques to analyze application code and its interaction with `fmdb` and SQLite to proactively identify potential vulnerability triggers before they are exploited.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion (via fmdb Query Execution)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion__via_fmdb_query_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft or trigger execution of highly resource-intensive SQL queries through `fmdb`. By sending a flood of these malicious queries or exploiting application logic to generate them, attackers can exhaust database server or device resources, leading to denial of service.
*   **How fmdb Contributes:** `fmdb` is the mechanism through which the application executes SQL queries.  Maliciously crafted or inefficient queries, when executed via `fmdb`, directly consume database resources (CPU, memory, I/O). `fmdb` is the tool that enables the execution of these resource-exhausting queries.
*   **Example:** An attacker identifies an endpoint in the application that, when triggered, causes `fmdb` to execute a complex SQL query with multiple joins and aggregations based on user-controlled parameters. By sending numerous requests to this endpoint with parameters designed to maximize query complexity, the attacker can overload the database, making the application unresponsive to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, slow performance, server/device crashes, impacting legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (High when easily exploitable and significantly impacts availability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Optimize SQL Queries Executed by fmdb:**  Carefully design and optimize all SQL queries executed by `fmdb`. Use indexes, avoid unnecessary complexity, and profile queries to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling on Application Endpoints:**  Implement rate limiting and throttling on application endpoints that trigger database queries via `fmdb`. This restricts the number of requests from a single source, mitigating flood-based DoS attacks.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor database resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) in real-time. Set up alerts to detect unusual spikes in resource consumption that might indicate a DoS attack.
    *   **Query Timeout Limits (Application Level):** Implement application-level timeout limits for database queries executed via `fmdb`. This prevents runaway queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   **Input Validation and Complexity Limits:** Validate user inputs that influence query parameters to prevent excessively complex or resource-intensive queries from being generated and executed by `fmdb`.
