# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ccgus/fmdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (Placeholder Usage)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__placeholder_usage_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all SQL query execution points** in your application code where you are using `fmdb` methods like `executeQuery:`, `executeUpdate:`, `executeUpdate:withArgumentsInArray:`, `executeQuery:withArgumentsInArray:`, etc.
    2.  **For each query, examine if user-provided data is being directly embedded** into the SQL query string using string formatting (e.g., `stringWithFormat:`) or concatenation.
    3.  **Replace direct embedding with placeholders (`?`).**  For every piece of user input that needs to be part of the query, substitute its position in the SQL string with a `?` placeholder.
    4.  **Utilize `fmdb`'s argument array methods.**  Specifically, use methods like `executeQuery:withArgumentsInArray:` or `executeUpdate:withArgumentsInArray:.
    5.  **Construct an `NSArray` containing the user-provided data.** The order of elements in the array must correspond to the order of `?` placeholders in your SQL query string.
    6.  **Pass the SQL query string with placeholders and the argument array** to the chosen `fmdb` execution method. `fmdb` will handle proper escaping and binding of the arguments, preventing SQL injection.
    7.  **Thoroughly test all query paths** to ensure they function correctly with parameterized queries and that user input is treated as data, not executable code.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity): Malicious users can inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating user input if queries are not parameterized. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of SQL Injection. Parameterized queries are the most effective and direct mitigation against this vulnerability when using `fmdb` to interact with SQLite.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented in the user authentication module for login queries, specifically when querying the user table based on username. Placeholders are used for the username and password parameters.
    *   Implemented in the search functionality within the application, where user-provided search terms are used in `SELECT` queries. Placeholders are used for the search terms.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not consistently applied in data update operations, particularly in older modules related to profile editing and data import features. Some update queries still use string formatting for constructing SQL statements.
    *   Missing in certain administrative functions that involve database modifications, especially in scripts used for database maintenance or data migration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep fmdb Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_fmdb_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly monitor for new releases of `fmdb`** on its GitHub repository ([https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb](https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb)) or through your dependency management system (e.g., CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager).
    2.  **Check release notes and changelogs** for each new `fmdb` version to identify bug fixes, security patches, and any relevant changes.
    3.  **Use a dependency management tool** to manage your project's dependencies, including `fmdb`. This simplifies the update process.
    4.  **Update the `fmdb` dependency** in your project to the latest stable version. Follow the update instructions provided by your dependency management tool.
    5.  **After updating `fmdb`, thoroughly test your application** to ensure compatibility and that no regressions or unexpected issues have been introduced by the update. Pay special attention to database interactions and functionalities that rely on `fmdb`.
    6.  **Establish a routine for periodically checking and updating** dependencies, including `fmdb`, as part of your application's maintenance and security practices.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in fmdb (High Severity): Older versions of `fmdb` might contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could be discovered and exploited. Updating to the latest version ensures you benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the `fmdb` maintainers.
    *   Indirect Vulnerabilities in Bundled SQLite (Medium Severity): While `fmdb` itself might not have vulnerabilities, it bundles a specific version of SQLite. Updating `fmdb` *may* also update the bundled SQLite version, indirectly mitigating potential vulnerabilities in the underlying SQLite library. (Note: `fmdb` might not always update SQLite with every release, so check release notes).
*   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in `fmdb` and potentially in the bundled SQLite version. Staying updated is a crucial part of maintaining a secure application.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `fmdb` is managed as a dependency using CocoaPods in the iOS project.
    *   Developers are generally aware of the need to update dependencies, but updates are often performed reactively rather than proactively.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated checks for `fmdb` updates or vulnerability scanning of the currently used `fmdb` version.
    *   Lack of a documented and enforced policy for regular `fmdb` updates and security patching.
    *   No formal process for monitoring `fmdb` release announcements or security advisories.
