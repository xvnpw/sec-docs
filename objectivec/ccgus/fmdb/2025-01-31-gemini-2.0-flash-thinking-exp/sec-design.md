# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Simplify SQLite database interactions for iOS and macOS developers.
 - Provide an easy-to-use Objective-C wrapper around SQLite.
 - Enhance developer productivity by abstracting away complex SQLite API details.
 - Enable efficient and reliable data persistence in applications.

- Business Risks:
 - Data breaches due to vulnerabilities in applications using fmdb.
 - Data integrity issues arising from improper database operations.
 - Application instability or crashes caused by incorrect fmdb usage or underlying SQLite issues.
 - Security vulnerabilities introduced through dependencies or build process.
 - Reputational damage if applications using fmdb are compromised.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Reliance on SQLite's built-in security features (e.g., access control, encryption extensions if enabled). Implemented within SQLite library.
 - security control: Operating system level security controls on iOS and macOS (e.g., sandboxing, permissions). Implemented by iOS and macOS.
 - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in SQLite library itself. Managed by SQLite development team and OS updates.
 - accepted risk: Improper usage of fmdb by developers leading to security issues. Mitigated by developer training and secure coding practices.
 - accepted risk: Lack of specific security features within fmdb wrapper itself, as it primarily focuses on functionality.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization for all data passed to fmdb queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Implementation location: within applications using fmdb, before calling fmdb methods.
 - security control: Conduct regular static and dynamic code analysis on applications using fmdb to identify potential vulnerabilities. Implementation location: within application development lifecycle.
 - security control: Implement secure coding practices and developer training focusing on secure database interactions. Implementation location: within application development process.
 - security control: Regularly update fmdb library and SQLite to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implementation location: within application dependency management.
 - security control: Consider using encrypted SQLite databases if sensitive data is stored. Implementation location: within applications using fmdb, leveraging SQLite encryption features.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Not directly applicable to fmdb library itself.
  - Applications using fmdb are responsible for implementing their own authentication mechanisms to control access to application features and data.
 - Authorization:
  - Applications using fmdb must implement authorization logic to control user access to specific data and operations within the database.
  - fmdb itself does not provide authorization features.
 - Input Validation:
  - Critical requirement. All inputs used in SQL queries constructed using fmdb must be thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  - This includes user inputs and data from external systems.
 - Cryptography:
  - If sensitive data is stored in the SQLite database, applications should utilize SQLite encryption extensions (e.g., SQLCipher) or application-level encryption to protect data at rest.
  - Key management for encryption must be implemented securely by the application.
