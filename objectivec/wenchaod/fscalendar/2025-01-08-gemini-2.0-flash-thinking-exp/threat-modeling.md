# Threat Model Analysis for wenchaod/fscalendar

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a URL or manipulates client-side data (e.g., through URL fragments or browser storage) that is then used by `fscalendar`'s JavaScript code in an unsafe way, leading to the execution of malicious scripts within the user's browser. This vulnerability resides within the client-side code of `fscalendar` itself if it doesn't handle certain inputs securely.
*   **Impact:** Similar to reflected or stored XSS, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution with the same potential consequences (session hijacking, data theft, redirection, etc.).
*   **Affected Component:** `FSCalendar`'s internal JavaScript code, particularly any functions or modules that process user-controlled input or URL parameters to dynamically update the calendar's display or behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `fscalendar` updated to the latest version, as developers may have patched DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Review the release notes and changelogs for `fscalendar` for any reported security vulnerabilities and their fixes.
    *   If contributing to or extending `fscalendar`, ensure thorough input validation and sanitization within the library's JavaScript code.
