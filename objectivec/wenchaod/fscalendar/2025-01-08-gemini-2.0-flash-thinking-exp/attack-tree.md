## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in fscalendar](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_fscalendar.md)

This is a critical area because successful exploitation can directly compromise the user's browser and potentially the application's security context.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Insecure Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_insecure_data_handling.md)

This path focuses on injecting malicious scripts into the web page through data that `fscalendar` processes and renders.

    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Inject Malicious Script through Event Data:
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   The application fetches event data from a source that is not trusted or does not properly sanitize its output.
            *   An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into fields of the event data, such as the title, description, or any other field that `fscalendar` will display.
            *   When `fscalendar` renders this event data on the user's browser, it includes the malicious script without proper encoding or sanitization.
            *   The browser executes the injected JavaScript, allowing the attacker to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or performing actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script through Configuration Options](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_through_configuration_options.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
            *   The application allows user-controlled input to influence the configuration of `fscalendar`. This could be through URL parameters, form fields, or other input mechanisms.
            *   An attacker crafts malicious input containing JavaScript code and provides it as a configuration option, for example, within a custom event renderer function or a tooltip template.
            *   When `fscalendar` uses this configuration to render elements, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script through fscalendar's Internal Logic for Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_through_fscalendar's_internal_logic_for_rendering.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
            *   This involves exploiting specific vulnerabilities within the `fscalendar` library itself.
            *   An attacker identifies a flaw in how `fscalendar` handles certain data structures, special characters, or HTML entities during the rendering process.
            *   The attacker crafts input data that specifically triggers this flaw, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the rendered output. This might involve bypassing the library's internal sanitization attempts or exploiting unexpected behavior in its rendering logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Indirectly Through fscalendar Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_indirectly_through_fscalendar_data.md)

This path focuses on manipulating data related to `fscalendar` interactions to exploit vulnerabilities on the server-side.

    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Manipulate Event Data to Trigger Server-Side Errors:
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   The attacker focuses on how the application processes data submitted through or related to `fscalendar` interactions, such as creating, updating, or deleting events.
            *   The attacker crafts malicious event data that bypasses any client-side validation implemented by `fscalendar` or the application. This could involve using excessively long fields, including special characters that the server-side is not prepared to handle, or using unexpected data types.
            *   When this malicious data is sent to the server, it triggers errors, exceptions, or unexpected behavior in the application's backend logic. This could potentially lead to information disclosure through error messages, denial of service, or other unintended consequences depending on how the server handles the invalid input.
