## Deep Analysis: Inject Malicious Script through Configuration Options in Application Using fscalendar

This analysis focuses on the attack path "Inject Malicious Script through Configuration Options" within an application utilizing the `fscalendar` library (https://github.com/wenchaod/fscalendar). We will dissect the attack, explore its potential impact, and recommend mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the application's failure to adequately sanitize or escape user-controlled input that is subsequently used to configure the `fscalendar` library. `fscalendar`, like many JavaScript libraries, offers a range of configuration options to customize its behavior and appearance. If an attacker can influence these options with malicious JavaScript code, they can achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Attack Vector: User-Controlled Configuration Input:**
   - The application exposes configuration settings for `fscalendar` that can be influenced by user input. Common sources of this input include:
     - **URL Parameters:**  Attackers could craft URLs with malicious JavaScript embedded in parameters intended for calendar configuration (e.g., `?eventRenderer=<script>...</script>`).
     - **Form Fields:**  Web forms might allow users to customize calendar appearance or behavior, inadvertently allowing script injection if proper sanitization is missing.
     - **API Requests:** If the application uses an API to configure the calendar, attackers could inject malicious scripts through API request bodies.
     - **Database or Configuration Files:** While less direct, if the application stores calendar configuration based on user preferences in a database or configuration file without proper sanitization, a prior vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious code there.

2. **Mechanism: Malicious Input as Configuration:**
   - The attacker crafts malicious input containing JavaScript code. This code could be disguised within seemingly legitimate configuration values. Examples include:
     - **Custom Event Renderer Function:** `fscalendar` often allows defining custom functions to render event details. An attacker could inject a function containing malicious JavaScript.
     - **Tooltip Templates:** If the application uses `fscalendar`'s tooltip functionality and allows user-defined templates, malicious scripts can be injected within the HTML structure of the template.
     - **Custom View Options:**  Depending on the application's implementation, there might be options to customize the calendar view, potentially allowing script injection.
     - **Callbacks or Event Handlers:** If the application allows defining custom callbacks or event handlers that are then passed to `fscalendar`, these could be exploited.

3. **Execution: Malicious Script in User's Browser:**
   - When the application renders the calendar using the attacker-crafted configuration, the malicious JavaScript code is interpreted and executed within the user's browser. This happens because `fscalendar` processes the configuration options and uses them to dynamically generate HTML and JavaScript.

**Concrete Examples of Potential Injection Points:**

While the exact injection points depend on the application's specific implementation, here are some likely candidates based on common `fscalendar` usage:

* **`eventContent` or similar rendering functions:** If the application allows users to customize how events are displayed, providing a function like:
  ```javascript
  function(arg) {
    return { html: `<div onclick="alert('XSS!')">${arg.event.title}</div>` };
  }
  ```
  could lead to execution.

* **Tooltip Templates:** If the application uses a tooltip feature and allows user input in the template, something like:
  ```html
  <div title="Click me <img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS!\")'>">Event Title</div>
  ```
  could be injected.

* **Custom View Options (if implemented):** If the application allows users to define custom views with specific rendering logic, this could be an attack vector.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

A successful injection of malicious script can have severe consequences:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the primary impact. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the user.
    * **Credential Theft:**  Capturing usernames and passwords entered on the page.
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive information displayed on the page or accessible through the user's session.
    * **Account Takeover:**  Performing actions on behalf of the compromised user.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:**  Redirecting the user to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.
    * **Defacement:**  Altering the content of the web page.
    * **Keylogging:**  Recording the user's keystrokes.

**Likelihood and Severity Assessment:**

* **Likelihood:** The likelihood depends on how the application handles user input related to `fscalendar` configuration. If the application directly uses user input without sanitization or escaping, the likelihood is **high**. If there are some basic checks but they are insufficient, the likelihood is **medium**.
* **Severity:** The severity of this vulnerability is **critical** due to the potential for full account compromise and data breaches associated with XSS.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this attack, the development team should implement the following mitigation strategies:

**1. Input Validation and Sanitization:**

* **Strict Input Validation:**  Define and enforce strict rules for the expected format and content of configuration options. Reject any input that does not conform to these rules.
* **Context-Aware Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Encode or escape user-provided data before it is used in HTML contexts. This prevents the browser from interpreting the data as executable code.
    * **HTML Escaping:**  Encode characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` to their HTML entities (e.g., `<` becomes `&lt;`). This is crucial for preventing script injection within HTML tags and attributes.
    * **JavaScript Escaping:** If the user input is used within JavaScript code, ensure proper JavaScript escaping to prevent code injection.
* **Use Libraries for Sanitization:** Leverage established libraries specifically designed for input sanitization and output encoding. These libraries are often more robust and less prone to bypasses than custom implementations.

**2. Content Security Policy (CSP):**

* **Implement a Strict CSP:** Define a Content Security Policy that restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This can significantly limit the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts or scripts loaded from untrusted domains.

**3. Secure Configuration Practices:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid exposing configuration options unnecessarily. Only expose the options that are absolutely required for the application's functionality.
* **Centralized Configuration Management:**  Manage `fscalendar` configuration in a secure and controlled manner. Avoid directly using user input for critical configuration settings.

**4. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential injection points and ensure that proper input validation and output encoding are implemented.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities, including XSS.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in the running application.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including those related to configuration injection.

**5. Security Awareness Training:**

* **Educate Developers:** Ensure that developers are aware of XSS vulnerabilities and best practices for preventing them.

**Testing Strategies to Verify Mitigation:**

* **Manual Testing:**  Attempt to inject various malicious scripts into the configuration options through all possible input channels (URL parameters, forms, API requests). Verify that the scripts are not executed.
* **Automated Testing:**  Develop automated tests that specifically target the configuration options and attempt to inject malicious payloads.
* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use browser developer tools to inspect the rendered HTML and JavaScript to confirm that user-provided data is properly encoded.
* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Utilize web vulnerability scanners to automatically detect XSS vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious Script through Configuration Options" attack path highlights a critical vulnerability stemming from insufficient input validation and output encoding. By allowing user-controlled input to directly influence the configuration of `fscalendar`, the application exposes itself to severe XSS risks. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, including robust input validation, context-aware output encoding, and a strict Content Security Policy, is crucial to protect users and the application from this type of attack. Continuous security testing and developer education are essential to maintain a secure application.
