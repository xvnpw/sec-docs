## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Output Encoding for Event Data](./mitigation_strategies/strict_output_encoding_for_event_data.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Output Encoding for Event Data
**Description:**
1.  Identify all locations in your application's front-end code where event data (titles, descriptions, etc.) is dynamically inserted into the HTML structure rendered by `fscalendar`.
2.  For each location, implement context-aware output encoding. If the data is being inserted into HTML content, use HTML encoding functions (e.g., in JavaScript, use a library or built-in functions to escape HTML entities like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`).
3.  If event data is used in JavaScript contexts (e.g., within event handlers or dynamically generated JavaScript code related to `fscalendar`), use JavaScript encoding functions to escape characters that could break JavaScript syntax or introduce vulnerabilities.
4.  Ensure that the encoding is applied *just before* the data is inserted into the HTML or JavaScript context, not earlier in the data processing pipeline.
5.  Regularly review and update your encoding functions to ensure they are robust and cover all relevant characters and contexts used by `fscalendar`.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High. Malicious scripts injected through event data displayed by `fscalendar` can be executed in users' browsers.
**Impact:**
*   XSS Mitigation: High. Effectively prevents XSS attacks originating from event data rendered by `fscalendar`.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   Output encoding is currently implemented in the `event-display.js` component, specifically when rendering event titles in the calendar view within `fscalendar`. HTML encoding is used for the title.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Server-side sanitization is missing for event descriptions that are eventually displayed by `fscalendar`. While titles are encoded on the client-side, descriptions are currently passed directly to the client without any sanitization or encoding on the server before being potentially rendered by `fscalendar`.
*   JavaScript encoding is not implemented for event data used in any JavaScript-based event handlers or dynamic JavaScript code directly related to `fscalendar`'s functionality.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side Sanitization of Event Data](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_sanitization_of_event_data.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Server-Side Sanitization of Event Data
**Description:**
1.  On the server-side, before sending event data to the client-side application that will be used by `fscalendar`, implement a sanitization process.
2.  Choose a robust HTML sanitization library appropriate for your server-side language (e.g., DOMPurify for JavaScript/Node.js, Bleach for Python, HTML Purifier for PHP).
3.  Configure the sanitization library to allow only a safe subset of HTML tags and attributes that are necessary for event descriptions or other event-related fields displayed by `fscalendar`. Deny potentially harmful tags like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, and attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, `javascript:`, `data:`.
4.  Apply the sanitization function to all event data fields that will be displayed by `fscalendar`, including titles, descriptions, and any other relevant fields.
5.  Regularly update the sanitization library to benefit from the latest security updates and rule sets, ensuring it remains effective against evolving XSS techniques relevant to how `fscalendar` might render data.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High. Server-side sanitization provides a crucial defense-in-depth layer against XSS vulnerabilities that could be exploited through data rendered by `fscalendar`.
**Impact:**
*   XSS Mitigation: High. Significantly reduces the risk of XSS in `fscalendar` by removing or neutralizing malicious content before it even reaches the client-side application and is rendered by the library.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   No server-side sanitization is currently implemented for event data that is used by `fscalendar`. Event data from the database is directly serialized and sent to the client-side application for use with `fscalendar`.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Server-side sanitization needs to be implemented in the API endpoint that serves event data (e.g., `/api/events`) which is consumed by the front-end application and used to populate `fscalendar`. This should be applied to all fields of the event data before it is sent in the API response and subsequently used by `fscalendar`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Code Review of fscalendar Integration](./mitigation_strategies/security_code_review_of_fscalendar_integration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Security Code Review of `fscalendar` Integration
**Description:**
1.  Conduct regular security-focused code reviews specifically for the parts of your application that integrate with `fscalendar`.
2.  Involve security experts or developers with security awareness in the code review process, focusing on aspects specific to `fscalendar`'s usage.
3.  Focus the code review on identifying potential security vulnerabilities directly related to how `fscalendar` is used, including data handling for display in the calendar, event rendering logic, and any user interactions with the calendar component.
4.  Specifically review code for:
    *   Proper output encoding and sanitization of data displayed by `fscalendar`.
    *   Secure data handling practices in the context of `fscalendar` (ensuring no sensitive data is unintentionally exposed or mishandled due to `fscalendar`'s client-side nature).
    *   Correct and secure usage of `fscalendar` API and configuration options to avoid misconfigurations that could introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Potential injection points and vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between your application's code and the `fscalendar` library.
5.  Document findings from code reviews and track remediation efforts specifically related to `fscalendar` integration.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   All potential vulnerabilities related to `fscalendar` integration - Severity: Varies (can be High, Medium, or Low depending on the vulnerability). Code reviews can identify a wide range of security issues specific to `fscalendar`'s usage that might be missed by automated tools and are crucial for ensuring secure integration of the library.
**Impact:**
*   `fscalendar` Integration Security Improvement: Medium to High. Code reviews specifically focused on `fscalendar` integration can significantly improve the security of how the library is used within the application, addressing vulnerabilities unique to its implementation.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   General code reviews are conducted for new features and major changes, but these are not specifically focused on security aspects of the `fscalendar` integration.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Security-focused code reviews specifically targeting the integration of `fscalendar` are not regularly conducted.
*   Establish a process for security code reviews as part of the development lifecycle, particularly when changes are made to the `fscalendar` integration or related data handling logic, ensuring that security considerations specific to `fscalendar` are addressed.
