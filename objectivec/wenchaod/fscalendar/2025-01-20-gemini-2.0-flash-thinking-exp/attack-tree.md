## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via fscalendar [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_fscalendar__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Achieving this means successfully exploiting one or more vulnerabilities within the `fscalendar` library or the application's integration with it to gain unauthorized access, control, or cause harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Data to fscalendar [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_data_to_fscalendar__critical_.md)

This represents a critical entry point for attackers. If the application allows the introduction of malicious data that is then processed by `fscalendar`, it opens up opportunities for exploitation. This can occur through various means, such as user input fields, data fetched from external sources, or even configuration settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Event Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_event_data__high_risk_.md)

This attack vector focuses on exploiting the way `fscalendar` handles event data. Attackers attempt to inject malicious content within the event details (title, description, etc.) that will be processed and rendered by the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject XSS Payload in Event Title/Description [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_xss_payload_in_event_titledescription__high_risk_.md)

This is a specific type of malicious data injection where the attacker crafts JavaScript code within the event title or description. If `fscalendar` doesn't properly sanitize or encode this input, the browser will execute the malicious script when the calendar is displayed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insufficient Output Encoding in fscalendar Rendering [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insufficient_output_encoding_in_fscalendar_rendering__high_risk__critical_.md)

This is the core vulnerability that enables the XSS attack described above. If `fscalendar` fails to properly encode HTML entities or other special characters when rendering event data, injected JavaScript code will be treated as executable code by the browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in fscalendar [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_fscalendar__high_risk_.md)

This attack vector targets publicly known weaknesses or bugs within the `fscalendar` library itself. These vulnerabilities might allow attackers to bypass security measures, execute arbitrary code, or cause other unintended behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

This refers to the attacker's strategy of utilizing vulnerabilities that have been publicly documented (e.g., through CVEs or security advisories). This makes the attack easier to execute as the vulnerability and potentially even exploit code are already known.

## Attack Tree Path: [Search for and Exploit CVEs or Known Issues [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/search_for_and_exploit_cves_or_known_issues__high_risk_.md)

This is the active process of an attacker looking for and then exploiting specific, documented vulnerabilities in `fscalendar`. This often involves using existing exploit code or adapting it to the target application.
