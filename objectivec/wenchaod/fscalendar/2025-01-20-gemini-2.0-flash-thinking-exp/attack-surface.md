# Attack Surface Analysis for wenchaod/fscalendar

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Event Data](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_event_data.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious JavaScript code is injected into event data (e.g., event titles, descriptions) and executed in users' browsers when the calendar renders this data.
*   **How fscalendar Contributes:** If `fscalendar` directly renders user-provided event data without proper sanitization or encoding, it becomes a conduit for XSS attacks. The library's rendering logic processes and displays this potentially malicious content.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects the following into an event title: `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!');</script>`. When a user views the calendar containing this event, the alert box will appear, demonstrating the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's session, including stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, performing actions on behalf of the user, and defacing the web page.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided event data on the server-side *before* it is passed to `fscalendar`. Remove or encode potentially harmful HTML tags and JavaScript.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure that `fscalendar` or the application's rendering logic encodes event data before displaying it in the DOM. This prevents the browser from interpreting malicious scripts. Use appropriate encoding functions for the context (e.g., HTML entity encoding).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based XSS via Configuration or Event Handlers](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_xss_via_configuration_or_event_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious JavaScript is injected through manipulating `fscalendar`'s configuration options or event handlers, leading to script execution within the user's browser.
*   **How fscalendar Contributes:** If `fscalendar` allows for dynamic configuration or event handlers that process user-controlled data without proper validation or sanitization, it can be exploited for DOM-based XSS. For example, if a callback function allows execution of arbitrary strings.
*   **Example:** An attacker might manipulate a URL parameter or form field that is used to configure `fscalendar`'s behavior, injecting a malicious JavaScript payload into a configuration option that is later used to manipulate the DOM.
*   **Impact:** Similar to reflected XSS, leading to session hijacking, redirection, and other malicious actions within the user's browser.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all data used to configure `fscalendar` or passed to its event handlers. Use whitelisting to allow only expected values.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of `eval()` or similar functions when processing data related to `fscalendar`'s configuration or events.
    *   **Secure Defaults:** Ensure `fscalendar` is initialized with secure default configurations.
    *   **Regularly Review Configuration Options:** Understand all configuration options provided by `fscalendar` and ensure they are used securely.
