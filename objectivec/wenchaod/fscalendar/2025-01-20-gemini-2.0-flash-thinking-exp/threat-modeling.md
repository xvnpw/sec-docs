# Threat Model Analysis for wenchaod/fscalendar

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Input](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** FSCalendar's rendering logic fails to properly sanitize user-provided data (e.g., event titles, descriptions) before inserting it into the DOM. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when the calendar is displayed in a user's browser.

**Impact:**  The attacker could steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected FSCalendar Component:** Rendering logic, specifically when displaying event titles, descriptions, or any other user-controlled data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Sanitize all user-provided data *before* passing it to FSCalendar. Use appropriate HTML escaping techniques.
*   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and mitigate the impact of XSS.
*   Avoid directly rendering raw HTML provided by users within FSCalendar elements.

## Threat: [Client-Side Logic Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/client-side_logic_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** A bug or vulnerability exists within the FSCalendar library's JavaScript code itself. An attacker can craft specific inputs or interactions with the calendar that trigger this vulnerability, leading to unexpected behavior or errors within the library's logic.

**Impact:** Could lead to a denial of service (client-side, freezing the user's browser), unexpected application behavior, or potentially, in severe cases, the ability to execute arbitrary code if a critical vulnerability exists within FSCalendar itself.

**Affected FSCalendar Component:** Various modules and functions within the FSCalendar library, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could include date parsing, event handling, or rendering logic.

**Risk Severity:** High (if the vulnerability allows for significant impact like code execution or widespread denial of service)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep the FSCalendar library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in FSCalendar.
*   Implement robust error handling in the application to gracefully handle unexpected behavior from FSCalendar.
