# Attack Surface Analysis for wenchaod/fscalendar

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration Options](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_configuration_options.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious JavaScript code through unsanitized configuration options processed and rendered by `fscalendar`.
*   **fscalendar Contribution:**  `fscalendar`'s code might render configuration options (e.g., event titles, custom HTML snippets) into the DOM without proper encoding or sanitization, creating an XSS vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  Providing a malicious event title like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` in the configuration. If `fscalendar` directly renders this title, the JavaScript will execute when the calendar is displayed.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's browser session, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, malware injection, or website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  `fscalendar` must rigorously sanitize all configuration options before rendering them. Implement HTML entity encoding or use a robust sanitization library to neutralize potentially harmful characters and scripts.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Employ a strong CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts, mitigating the impact of XSS even if it occurs.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based XSS via Unsafe DOM Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_xss_via_unsafe_dom_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** XSS vulnerabilities arising from insecure DOM manipulation within `fscalendar`'s JavaScript code, where user-controlled data or configuration options are directly inserted into the DOM without sanitization.
*   **fscalendar Contribution:**  If `fscalendar` uses JavaScript methods like `innerHTML` to insert user-provided data or configuration values into the DOM without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to DOM-based XSS.
*   **Example:**  If `fscalendar` allows users to provide custom notes for calendar dates and uses `innerHTML` to display these notes without sanitizing them, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript within the notes.
*   **Impact:** Similar to reflected XSS, DOM-based XSS can result in complete compromise of the user's browser session, data exfiltration, and unauthorized actions performed on the user's behalf.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure DOM APIs:**  `fscalendar`'s developers should use secure DOM manipulation methods. Prefer `textContent` or `setAttribute` for inserting user-provided data. If `innerHTML` is necessary, ensure rigorous sanitization of the input using a trusted library.
    *   **Code Review and Security Audit:**  Thoroughly review `fscalendar`'s JavaScript source code to identify and rectify any instances of unsafe DOM manipulation. Conduct regular security audits to proactively find and fix vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Logic Flaws Leading to Security Bypass](./attack_surfaces/client-side_logic_flaws_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or logical errors within `fscalendar`'s JavaScript code that, while not directly XSS, can be exploited to bypass security mechanisms or cause unintended actions within the application that integrates `fscalendar`.
*   **fscalendar Contribution:**  Complex logic in `fscalendar` (e.g., date handling, event processing, UI state management) might contain flaws that, when triggered by specific user inputs or configurations, can lead to security-relevant issues in the application using it.
*   **Example:** A logic error in `fscalendar`'s event handling might allow an attacker to manipulate event display or scheduling in a way that bypasses intended access controls or data validation implemented by the application.  For instance, manipulating date ranges to view events they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Impact:**  Potential bypass of application security controls, unauthorized access to data or functionality, or data integrity issues, depending on how the application relies on `fscalendar`'s logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can escalate to Critical depending on the bypassed security mechanism and its impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Testing:**  Implement comprehensive testing of the application's integration with `fscalendar`, focusing on edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential logic flaws in `fscalendar`'s behavior. Include security-focused test cases to identify potential bypass scenarios.
    *   **Library Updates and Patches:**  Stay vigilant for updates and security patches released for `fscalendar`. Apply updates promptly to address known vulnerabilities and logic errors.
    *   **Input Validation and Server-Side Verification:**  Do not solely rely on client-side logic provided by `fscalendar` for security-critical operations. Implement robust input validation and server-side verification to enforce security controls and prevent bypasses.
