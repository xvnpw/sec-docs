# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, fscalendar, provides a customizable calendar component for iOS applications.

- Business priorities:
  - Provide a reusable and visually appealing calendar component for iOS developers.
  - Offer a flexible and feature-rich calendar solution that can be easily integrated into various iOS projects.
  - Maintain a high-quality, well-documented, and actively supported component to ensure developer satisfaction.

- Business goals:
  - Increase developer productivity by offering a ready-to-use calendar component, saving development time and effort.
  - Enhance the user experience of iOS applications by providing a polished and intuitive calendar interface.
  - Establish fscalendar as a popular and trusted calendar component within the iOS development community.

- Business risks:
  - Component defects leading to incorrect date or time handling in applications, potentially causing data corruption or functional errors.
  - Security vulnerabilities within the component that could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using fscalendar.
  - Performance issues within the component that could negatively impact the responsiveness and user experience of applications.
  - Lack of updates or maintenance, leading to incompatibility with newer iOS versions or unresolved bugs, diminishing developer trust and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- Accepted risk: As an open-source project, formal security audits and penetration testing are unlikely to be performed regularly.
- Accepted risk: Vulnerabilities might be discovered and disclosed by the community, potentially after exploitation in applications using the component.

- Recommended security controls:
  - Security control: Implement automated static code analysis (SAST) tools in the development workflow to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
  - Security control: Conduct regular manual code reviews, focusing on security best practices and common vulnerability patterns.
  - Security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in any third-party libraries or dependencies used by the component.
  - Security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities discovered by the community or through internal testing.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI component. Authentication is expected to be handled by the application integrating fscalendar.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a UI component. Authorization is expected to be handled by the application integrating fscalendar.
  - Input validation: The component should validate all inputs, such as dates, times, and user interactions, to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. This is especially important when handling user-provided data to configure or interact with the calendar.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not expected to be a core requirement for this UI component. If the component were to handle or store sensitive date-related data (which is not the primary purpose), appropriate encryption measures would be necessary. For now, cryptography is not considered a primary security requirement.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process: Ensuring correct and reliable calendar functionality within iOS applications that use fscalendar. Incorrect date handling or component malfunction could lead to data errors, scheduling conflicts, or user dissatisfaction in applications relying on accurate calendar information.

- Data to protect:
  - Source code of fscalendar: Sensitivity: Medium. Confidentiality and integrity of the source code are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of potential vulnerabilities.
  - Build artifacts (compiled library): Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Integrity of build artifacts is important to ensure that developers are using a safe and unmodified version of the component.
  - User data handled by applications using fscalendar: Sensitivity: Varies depending on the application. fscalendar itself is a UI component and ideally should not handle sensitive user data directly. However, applications integrating fscalendar might display or process sensitive date-related information. The security of this data is primarily the responsibility of the integrating application, but fscalendar should not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Is fscalendar intended to handle any user-sensitive data directly, or is it purely a UI component for date selection and display?
  - Are there specific performance requirements for fscalendar, especially in resource-constrained iOS environments?
  - What is the intended support and maintenance model for fscalendar? Will there be regular updates and security patches?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., accessibility, data privacy) that fscalendar needs to adhere to?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a useful and reliable calendar component for iOS developers to enhance their applications. The project is community-driven and aims for wide adoption within the iOS development community.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important but not the absolute top priority for this open-source UI component compared to projects handling sensitive backend data. Basic security best practices and community scrutiny are the main security controls currently in place.
  - DESIGN: fscalendar is designed as a UI library to be integrated into iOS applications. It focuses on providing calendar UI functionality and relies on the integrating application for data handling, business logic, and security context. Deployment is primarily through dependency managers like Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods, and Carthage, and ultimately deployed as part of iOS applications distributed via the App Store or TestFlight.
