# Threat Model Analysis for wenchaod/fscalendar

## Threat: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Event Handling](./threats/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_event_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-provided event handlers or callbacks within `fscalendar` configuration. When `fscalendar` executes these handlers, the malicious script runs in the user's browser. This could be achieved by manipulating input fields that are used to configure `fscalendar` event handlers, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles and passes data to `fscalendar`.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking, credential theft), data theft (access to sensitive information displayed or managed by the application), website defacement, malware distribution (redirecting users to malicious sites or injecting malware).
*   **Affected fscalendar component:** Event handling mechanisms, potentially configuration options related to event callbacks (if exposed and vulnerable).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in `fscalendar` configuration, especially for event handlers.  Avoid directly using user input to construct JavaScript functions.
    *   **Secure Event Handler Configuration:** If `fscalendar` allows custom event handlers, ensure the configuration mechanism is secure and does not allow direct injection of arbitrary JavaScript. Prefer using predefined event types and passing data parameters rather than raw code.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts. This acts as a defense-in-depth measure to mitigate the impact of XSS.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of the application's integration with `fscalendar` to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Client-Side DOM-Based XSS through Configuration Options](./threats/client-side_dom-based_xss_through_configuration_options.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits `fscalendar` configuration options that allow direct DOM manipulation using user-controlled data. By crafting malicious input for these configuration options, the attacker can inject JavaScript code that executes when `fscalendar` renders or updates the calendar in the DOM. This could be achieved through URL parameters, form inputs, or other user-controlled data sources that influence `fscalendar`'s configuration.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Affected fscalendar component:** Configuration options that directly manipulate the DOM, rendering logic that uses configuration data to modify DOM elements.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict DOM Manipulation Configuration:** Avoid using `fscalendar` configuration options that allow direct and unsanitized DOM manipulation with user-provided data.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Encoding:** Sanitize and encode any user-provided data used in `fscalendar` configuration before it is used to modify the DOM. Use browser APIs for safe HTML manipulation if necessary.
    *   **Templating and Data Binding:** Utilize templating engines or data binding mechanisms provided by your application framework to populate calendar data instead of directly manipulating the DOM through `fscalendar` configuration. This reduces the risk of injecting malicious code through configuration.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Perform regular security testing, including DOM-based XSS testing, to identify vulnerabilities in the application's integration with `fscalendar`.
