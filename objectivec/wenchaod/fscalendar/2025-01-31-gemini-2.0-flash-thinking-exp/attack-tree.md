## Attack Tree Visualization

Attack Goal: Compromise Application Using fscalendar Vulnerabilities
└─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 1. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in fscalendar (OR)
    └─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (OR)
        └─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.1.1. Inject Malicious Script via Event Data (AND)
            ├─── [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.1.1. Application passes unsanitized data to fscalendar for event display.
            └─── [CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.1.2. fscalendar renders event data without proper output encoding.
└─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 2. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (OR)
    └─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 2.1. Vulnerable Dependencies Used by fscalendar (AND)
        └─── [CRITICAL NODE] 2.1.1. fscalendar relies on vulnerable JavaScript libraries or components.
└─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 3. Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Integration (OR)
    └─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 3.1. Insecure Event Handling in Application (AND)
        └─── [CRITICAL NODE] 3.1.1. Application's event handlers for fscalendar events (e.g., date selection) are vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in fscalendar](./attack_tree_paths/1___high_risk_path__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_fscalendar.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within the client-side JavaScript code of `fscalendar` or how the application uses it, aiming to execute malicious scripts in the user's browser.

    *   **1.1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how `fscalendar` handles and renders data, allowing them to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when they interact with the calendar.

            *   **1.1.1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Script via Event Data**
                *   **Critical Node: 1.1.1.1. Application passes unsanitized data to fscalendar for event display.**
                    *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
                        *   The application retrieves event data (e.g., titles, descriptions) from a source (database, API) without proper sanitization.
                        *   This unsanitized data, potentially containing malicious JavaScript code injected by an attacker, is directly passed to `fscalendar` for rendering.
                        *   `fscalendar` receives this data and processes it to display events on the calendar.
                        *   If `fscalendar` or the application's rendering process does not properly encode or sanitize this data before inserting it into the HTML DOM, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser when the calendar is displayed.
                        *   **Example Scenario:** An attacker injects `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into an event title in the application's database. When the application fetches and displays this event using `fscalendar`, the alert box will pop up, demonstrating XSS.

                *   **Critical Node: 1.1.1.2. fscalendar renders event data without proper output encoding.**
                    *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
                        *   Even if the application attempts to sanitize event data *before* storing it or passing it to `fscalendar`, `fscalendar` itself might be vulnerable if it renders the event data without proper output encoding.
                        *   Output encoding is crucial to convert potentially harmful characters (like `<`, `>`, `
