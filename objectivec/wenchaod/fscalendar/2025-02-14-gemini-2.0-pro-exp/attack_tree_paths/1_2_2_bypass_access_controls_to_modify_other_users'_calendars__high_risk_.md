# Deep Analysis of FSCalendar Attack Tree Path: 1.2.2 Bypass Access Controls to Modify Other Users' Calendars

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could allow an attacker to bypass access controls within an application utilizing the FSCalendar library and subsequently modify other users' calendar data.  This includes identifying specific weaknesses in the library's implementation, the application's integration with the library, and the surrounding infrastructure that could be exploited.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following areas:

*   **FSCalendar Library (https://github.com/wenchaod/fscalendar):**  We will examine the library's code (to the extent possible without a full code audit) and documentation for potential vulnerabilities related to access control.  This includes reviewing how the library handles user identification, authorization, and data separation.  We will *not* perform a full penetration test of the library itself, but rather focus on how its features and potential weaknesses could be exploited in the context of the attack path.
*   **Application Integration:**  This is the *most critical* part of the scope.  We will analyze how a hypothetical application *using* FSCalendar might implement user authentication, authorization, and data management.  We will focus on common integration patterns and potential misconfigurations that could lead to access control bypasses.  This includes how the application handles user sessions, API requests related to calendar data, and database interactions.
*   **Server-Side Logic:**  We will examine the server-side components that interact with FSCalendar, including API endpoints, database queries, and any business logic related to calendar data manipulation.  This is crucial because even if FSCalendar itself is secure, flaws in the server-side implementation can easily lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Client-Side (Limited):** While the primary focus is on server-side vulnerabilities, we will briefly consider client-side aspects that could *contribute* to the attack, such as potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) that could be leveraged to manipulate calendar data indirectly.

**Out of Scope:**

*   **Full Penetration Testing:** This analysis is a threat modeling exercise, not a full penetration test.
*   **Network Infrastructure:**  We will assume a reasonably secure network infrastructure.  We won't delve into network-level attacks (e.g., DDoS, man-in-the-middle) unless they directly relate to exploiting the specific attack path.
*   **Physical Security:**  Physical access to servers or devices is out of scope.
*   **Social Engineering:**  We will not consider attacks that rely on tricking users into revealing credentials or performing actions.
*   **Other FSCalendar Attack Paths:** This analysis is *solely* focused on attack path 1.2.2.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Information Gathering:**  Review FSCalendar documentation, source code (where available and relevant), and common usage patterns.  Identify key functions and data structures related to data access and modification.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  Based on the gathered information, identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to bypass access controls.  This will involve considering various attack scenarios and how they might be executed.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  For each identified threat, analyze the likelihood of exploitation and the potential impact.  Consider factors such as the complexity of the attack, the required privileges, and the sensitivity of the compromised data.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  For each identified vulnerability, propose specific and actionable mitigation strategies.  These recommendations should be practical and address the root cause of the vulnerability.
5.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document all findings, including the identified threats, vulnerabilities, impact assessments, and mitigation recommendations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Path 1.2.2: Bypass Access Controls to Modify Other Users' Calendars

This section details the core analysis of the attack path.

**4.1 Potential Attack Vectors and Vulnerabilities**

Based on the scope and methodology, here are several potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities that could lead to the successful execution of attack path 1.2.2:

*   **4.1.1  Insufficient Authorization Checks on Server-Side API Endpoints:**

    *   **Vulnerability:** The most likely and critical vulnerability.  The server-side API endpoints responsible for handling calendar data modification requests (e.g., `POST /api/calendar/events`, `PUT /api/calendar/events/{id}`, `DELETE /api/calendar/events/{id}`) might not properly verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to modify the *specific* calendar event or calendar being targeted.  This is often due to inadequate checks on the `user_id` or `calendar_id` associated with the request.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker authenticates as User A.  They then craft a malicious request to modify an event belonging to User B, by changing the `event_id` or `calendar_id` parameter in the request.  If the server-side code only checks if the user is authenticated (and not *which* user owns the data), the request will succeed.
    *   **Example (Conceptual):**
        *   Legitimate Request (User A): `POST /api/calendar/events` with data: `{ "calendar_id": "A_calendar", "event_id": "A_event", "title": "Meeting" }`
        *   Malicious Request (User A attacking User B): `POST /api/calendar/events` with data: `{ "calendar_id": "B_calendar", "event_id": "B_event", "title": "Compromised" }`
    *   **Likelihood:** High. This is a very common vulnerability in web applications.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Allows complete control over other users' calendar data.

*   **4.1.2  Predictable Resource Identifiers (Event IDs, Calendar IDs):**

    *   **Vulnerability:** If the `event_id` or `calendar_id` values are predictable (e.g., sequential integers), an attacker can easily guess the IDs of other users' resources and attempt to modify them (combined with 4.1.1).
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker observes that their own calendar events have IDs like 1, 2, 3.  They then try to access or modify events with IDs 4, 5, 6, hoping to hit another user's data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Depends on the application's ID generation strategy.
    *   **Impact:** High (when combined with 4.1.1).

*   **4.1.3  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**

    *   **Vulnerability:**  This is a specific type of insufficient authorization (4.1.1) where the application exposes direct references to internal objects (like calendar events) without proper access control checks.  The attacker can directly manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  Similar to 4.1.1, but the vulnerability is specifically due to the lack of validation of the object reference itself.
    *   **Likelihood:** High.  IDOR is a very common web application vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** High.

*   **4.1.4  Broken Access Control Logic in FSCalendar Integration:**

    *   **Vulnerability:**  The application might misinterpret or incorrectly implement the intended access control mechanisms provided by FSCalendar (if any).  For example, the application might not correctly use the delegate methods or properties related to data source and user permissions.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  The application developer might misunderstand how to use FSCalendar's delegate methods to filter events based on user ownership, leading to all events being displayed or modifiable regardless of the logged-in user.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Depends on the developer's understanding of the library.
    *   **Impact:** High.

*   **4.1.5  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Indirect Attack):**
    *  **Vulnerability:** If the application lacks CSRF protection, an attacker can trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a request to modify another user's calendar. This is an *indirect* attack, as the attacker doesn't directly bypass access controls, but leverages the victim's authenticated session.
    * **Attack Scenario:** An attacker crafts a malicious website that, when visited by a logged-in user, sends a hidden request to the application's API to modify a calendar event. The request will be executed with the victim's credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends on the presence of CSRF protection.
    * **Impact:** High.

*   **4.1.6  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Indirect Attack):**

    *   **Vulnerability:**  If the application is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of another user's browser.  This code could then be used to make requests to the API to modify calendar data, bypassing access controls by using the victim's session.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker injects a script into a calendar event description (if the application doesn't properly sanitize input).  When another user views that event, the script executes and modifies their calendar data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Depends on the application's input validation and output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** High.

**4.2 Mitigation Recommendations**

For each identified vulnerability, here are the corresponding mitigation strategies:

*   **4.2.1  Mitigate Insufficient Authorization Checks:**

    *   **Implement Robust Authorization:**  For *every* API endpoint that modifies calendar data, implement strict authorization checks.  These checks should verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions (e.g., ownership, specific role) to modify the *specific* calendar event or calendar being targeted.  This usually involves comparing the user ID associated with the request to the user ID associated with the resource.
    *   **Use a Centralized Authorization Service:**  Consider using a centralized authorization service or library to manage access control logic, rather than implementing it ad-hoc in each endpoint.  This promotes consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that users only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.  Don't grant unnecessary access.

*   **4.2.2  Mitigate Predictable Resource Identifiers:**

    *   **Use UUIDs:**  Use Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) instead of sequential integers for event IDs and calendar IDs.  UUIDs are virtually guaranteed to be unique and are not predictable.
    *   **Randomized IDs:**  If UUIDs are not suitable, use a strong random number generator to create IDs, ensuring sufficient length and entropy to prevent guessing.

*   **4.2.3  Mitigate IDOR:**

    *   **Indirect Object References:**  Use indirect object references (e.g., session-based lookups) instead of exposing direct object IDs to the client.  For example, instead of passing the `event_id` directly, the client might pass a session-specific token that the server uses to retrieve the corresponding event.
    *   **Access Control Checks:**  Even with indirect references, always perform authorization checks on the server-side to ensure the user has permission to access the requested resource.

*   **4.2.4  Mitigate Broken Access Control Logic in FSCalendar Integration:**

    *   **Thoroughly Understand FSCalendar:**  Carefully review the FSCalendar documentation and understand how its delegate methods and properties relate to data access and user permissions.
    *   **Implement Delegate Methods Correctly:**  Use the appropriate delegate methods (e.g., `calendar(_:shouldSelect:at:)`, `calendar(_:shouldDeselect:at:)`, data source methods) to filter events and control user interaction based on ownership and permissions.
    *   **Unit and Integration Tests:**  Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify that the access control logic is working as expected.

*   **4.2.5  Mitigate CSRF:**

    *   **Synchronizer Token Pattern:**  Implement the synchronizer token pattern (also known as CSRF tokens).  This involves generating a unique, unpredictable token for each user session and including it in all forms and AJAX requests.  The server verifies the token on each request to ensure it originated from the legitimate application.
    *   **Double Submit Cookie:** Another CSRF mitigation technique.
    *   **Framework-Specific Protections:**  Use the CSRF protection mechanisms provided by your web framework (e.g., Django's CSRF middleware, Ruby on Rails' `protect_from_forgery`).

*   **4.2.6  Mitigate XSS:**

    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate all user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format and data type.  Reject any input that contains potentially malicious characters or patterns.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode all output that is displayed in the user interface to prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code.  Use context-specific encoding (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources (e.g., scripts, stylesheets).  This can help prevent XSS attacks even if input validation or output encoding fails.
    * **HttpOnly Cookies:** Set HttpOnly flag for cookies.

## 5. Conclusion

The attack path "Bypass Access Controls to Modify Other Users' Calendars" represents a significant security risk for applications using the FSCalendar library. The most likely vulnerabilities stem from insufficient authorization checks on the server-side, particularly within API endpoints handling calendar data modification. Predictable resource identifiers and IDOR vulnerabilities further exacerbate this risk. While FSCalendar itself might have built-in security features, the application's integration with the library and the surrounding server-side logic are crucial areas to secure. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack path, protecting user data and maintaining the integrity of the application. Regular security audits and penetration testing are also recommended to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
