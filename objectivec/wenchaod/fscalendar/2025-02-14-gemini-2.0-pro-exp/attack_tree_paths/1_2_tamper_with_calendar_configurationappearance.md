# Deep Analysis: FSCalendar Attack Tree Path 1.2 - Tamper with Calendar Configuration/Appearance

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, understand, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities related to unauthorized modification of the FSCalendar's configuration and appearance within the target application.  We aim to prevent attackers from manipulating the calendar's visual presentation or underlying settings to deceive users, disrupt application functionality, or gain further access.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path "1.2 Tamper with Calendar Configuration/Appearance" within the broader attack tree.  The scope includes:

*   **FSCalendar Library (https://github.com/wenchaod/fscalendar):**  We will examine the library's public API, source code (where relevant and accessible), and known issues/vulnerabilities related to configuration and appearance manipulation.
*   **Application Integration:** How the application utilizes FSCalendar is crucial.  We'll analyze how the application:
    *   Initializes and configures the calendar.
    *   Handles user input that might affect the calendar's appearance or settings.
    *   Stores and retrieves calendar configuration data.
    *   Implements any custom styling or behavior modifications.
*   **Client-Side and Server-Side Considerations:**  We will consider both client-side attacks (e.g., JavaScript manipulation) and server-side attacks (e.g., injection vulnerabilities in configuration data).
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *excludes* attacks that do not directly target the calendar's configuration or appearance (e.g., attacks on the underlying database that stores event data, but not the calendar's display settings).  It also excludes general application security vulnerabilities not directly related to FSCalendar.

## 3. Methodology

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  We will review the application's code that interacts with FSCalendar, focusing on areas where configuration and appearance are set or modified.  This includes examining:
    *   Swift/Objective-C code (since FSCalendar is an iOS library).
    *   Any server-side code (e.g., in Node.js, Python, etc.) that generates or processes calendar configuration data.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will perform various tests to attempt to manipulate the calendar's configuration and appearance:
    *   **Input Validation Testing:**  We'll provide unexpected or malicious input to any fields or parameters that control the calendar's appearance (e.g., colors, fonts, date formats, locale settings).
    *   **Client-Side Manipulation:** Using browser developer tools, we'll attempt to modify the calendar's properties and behavior directly in the running application.
    *   **API Testing:** If the application exposes APIs related to calendar configuration, we'll test these APIs for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzzing:** If configuration is loaded from a file or database, we will use fuzzing techniques to test for vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker scenarios and motivations to identify potential attack vectors.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities in FSCalendar and related libraries.
*   **Documentation Review:** We will review the FSCalendar documentation for best practices and security recommendations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2

This section details the specific analysis of the "Tamper with Calendar Configuration/Appearance" attack path.

**4.1 Potential Attack Vectors:**

Based on the FSCalendar library and typical application usage, here are some potential attack vectors:

*   **4.1.1 Unvalidated User Input:** If the application allows users to customize the calendar's appearance (e.g., colors, themes, date/time formats) through user input fields, and this input is not properly validated and sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious code or unexpected values.  This could lead to:
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the calendar renders user-provided configuration data without proper escaping, an attacker could inject JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers.  This is *less likely* with FSCalendar, as it's a native iOS component, but still possible if the configuration data is passed to a web view or used in a hybrid application.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could provide extremely large or invalid values that cause the calendar to crash or become unresponsive.  For example, setting an extremely large font size or an invalid date format.
    *   **Visual Spoofing:** An attacker could manipulate the calendar's appearance to make it look like a different date or time, potentially misleading users.  For example, changing the color scheme to make past events appear as future events.
    *   **Configuration Corruption:**  Invalid input could corrupt the calendar's configuration data, leading to unexpected behavior or application errors.

*   **4.1.2 Client-Side Manipulation (JavaScript/Developer Tools):**  Even if server-side validation is in place, an attacker could use browser developer tools to directly modify the JavaScript objects and properties that control the FSCalendar's appearance.  This is particularly relevant if the application uses a hybrid approach (e.g., React Native, Ionic) or exposes FSCalendar's properties through a JavaScript bridge.  The attacker could:
    *   Change colors, fonts, and other visual properties.
    *   Modify the displayed date range or selected date.
    *   Disable or alter event indicators.
    *   Bypass client-side validation checks.

*   **4.1.3 Server-Side Configuration Injection:** If the calendar's configuration is stored on the server (e.g., in a database or configuration file) and the application is vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection, file inclusion), an attacker could modify the configuration data directly.  This could lead to:
    *   Persistent changes to the calendar's appearance for all users.
    *   Injection of malicious code (e.g., XSS payloads) if the configuration data is used in a web context.
    *   Denial of service by corrupting the configuration.

*   **4.1.4  Insecure Storage of Configuration Data:** If the calendar configuration data is stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text, in a world-readable file, or with weak encryption), an attacker who gains access to the storage location could modify the configuration.

*   **4.1.5  Lack of Integrity Checks:** If the application doesn't verify the integrity of the calendar configuration data, an attacker could modify the data in transit (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack) or at rest.

*   **4.1.6  Default Configuration Weaknesses:** If the application uses default FSCalendar settings that are insecure or easily guessable, an attacker might be able to exploit these weaknesses.

**4.2 Mitigation Strategies:**

For each identified attack vector, we propose the following mitigation strategies:

*   **4.2.1  Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly validate all user input** that affects the calendar's configuration or appearance.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only known-good values.
    *   **Sanitize any user input** that is used to generate the calendar's configuration.  Escape any special characters that could be interpreted as code.
    *   **Enforce data type and range checks.** For example, ensure that color values are valid hex codes, font sizes are within reasonable limits, and date formats are supported.
    *   **Consider using a configuration template** and only allowing users to modify specific, pre-defined parameters.

*   **4.2.2  Client-Side Hardening:**
    *   **Minimize the exposure of FSCalendar's internal properties** to JavaScript.  Avoid directly manipulating the calendar's properties from JavaScript if possible.
    *   **Implement client-side validation** as a first line of defense, but *never rely on it solely*.  Always validate on the server.
    *   **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)** to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating the risk of XSS. (Relevant if used in a hybrid context).
    *   **Consider using obfuscation and anti-tampering techniques** to make it more difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer and modify the client-side code.

*   **4.2.3  Secure Configuration Storage and Handling:**
    *   **Store calendar configuration data securely.** Use appropriate encryption and access controls.
    *   **Protect against injection attacks** on the server-side.  Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.  Sanitize input to NoSQL databases.  Avoid file inclusion vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implement input validation and sanitization** on the server-side, even if the data is coming from a trusted source (e.g., a database).
    *   **Use a secure configuration management system.**

*   **4.2.4  Integrity Checks:**
    *   **Use checksums or digital signatures** to verify the integrity of the calendar configuration data.
    *   **Implement tamper-evident logging** to detect unauthorized modifications to the configuration.

*   **4.2.5  Secure Defaults:**
    *   **Review and harden the default FSCalendar configuration.**  Avoid using default settings that are known to be insecure.
    *   **Provide a secure configuration template** for developers to use.

*   **4.2.6  Regular Updates and Patching:**
    *   **Keep FSCalendar and all related libraries up to date.**  Apply security patches promptly.
    *   **Monitor for new vulnerabilities** in FSCalendar and related components.

* **4.2.7 Specific FSCalendar Considerations:**
    *  **`appearance` Property:** Carefully review how the `appearance` property of `FSCalendar` is used and configured. Ensure that any user-configurable aspects of appearance are strictly validated.
    * **Delegates:** Examine the implementation of `FSCalendarDelegate` and `FSCalendarDataSource` methods.  Ensure that these methods do not introduce vulnerabilities by mishandling user input or configuration data.
    * **Custom Cells:** If custom calendar cells are used, thoroughly review their implementation for potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Locale and Time Zone Handling:** Ensure that locale and time zone settings are handled securely and that user input related to these settings is validated.

**4.3  Testing Plan:**

A comprehensive testing plan should include:

*   **Unit Tests:**  Test individual components and functions related to calendar configuration and appearance.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between the application and FSCalendar.
*   **Security Tests:**  Specifically target the identified attack vectors with penetration testing and fuzzing.
*   **Regression Tests:**  Ensure that security fixes do not introduce new bugs or regressions.
