Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the `FSCalendar` library.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.4 Exploit Unsanitized URL in Event

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:**  To thoroughly analyze the vulnerability of injecting malicious URLs into event data within an application utilizing the `FSCalendar` library, understand the potential impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this type of attack.

### 2. Scope

*   **Target Library:**  `FSCalendar` (https://github.com/wenchaod/fscalendar) -  We will focus on how this specific iOS calendar library handles event data, particularly URLs.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Injection of malicious URLs into event data.  This implies that the application using `FSCalendar` accepts user input (or input from an external source) that is used to populate event details, including URLs.
*   **Impact:**  We will consider the impact on the application user, the application itself, and potentially any backend systems interacting with the application.
*   **Exclusions:**  We will *not* cover general iOS security best practices unrelated to `FSCalendar` or URL handling.  We will also not delve into attacks that do *not* involve URL injection into event data.  We will assume the application is using a relatively recent version of `FSCalendar`.

### 3. Methodology

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the `FSCalendar` source code on GitHub to identify how event data is handled, specifically:
        *   How event objects are created and populated.
        *   Which properties of event objects might store URLs (e.g., `event.url`, `event.notes`, custom properties).
        *   Whether any built-in URL validation or sanitization is performed by the library itself.
        *   How the library renders or displays event data, particularly URLs.  Are they directly clickable?  Are they passed to other components?
    *   Identify potential entry points for user-supplied URLs.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   Create a simple test application that integrates `FSCalendar`.
    *   Attempt to inject various malicious URL payloads into event data:
        *   **JavaScript URLs:** `javascript:alert('XSS')` -  Tests for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
        *   **Data URLs:** `data:text/html,<script>alert('XSS')</script>` - Another XSS vector.
        *   **Phishing URLs:**  URLs that mimic legitimate websites to steal credentials.
        *   **Malware URLs:** URLs that point to malicious downloads.
        *   **App Scheme URLs:**  URLs that attempt to launch other applications on the device with potentially malicious parameters (e.g., `sms:`, `tel:`, custom app schemes).
        *   **Long URLs:**  Extremely long URLs to test for buffer overflow vulnerabilities (unlikely, but worth checking).
    *   Observe the application's behavior:
        *   Does the application crash?
        *   Are the malicious URLs rendered as clickable links?
        *   Is any injected JavaScript code executed?
        *   Are other applications launched unexpectedly?
        *   Is any sensitive data leaked?

3.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   Based on the code review and dynamic analysis, determine the potential impact of successful exploitation.

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   Provide specific, actionable steps developers can take to prevent the vulnerability.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.4

#### 4.1 Code Review (Static Analysis)

After reviewing the `FSCalendar` source code, the following observations are made:

*   **Event Data Model:** `FSCalendar` primarily uses delegate methods to provide data to the calendar.  There isn't a single, centralized "event object" in the same way that, say, `EKEvent` (from EventKit) works.  Instead, the developer provides data (titles, subtitles, images, etc.) on demand through delegate methods like:
    *   `calendar(_:titleFor:)`
    *   `calendar(_:subtitleFor:)`
    *   `calendar(_:imageFor:)`
    *   `calendar(_:appearance:eventDefaultColorsFor:)`
    *   And others related to appearance and selection.

*   **No Explicit URL Property:**  `FSCalendar` itself does *not* have a dedicated property for storing URLs within its core data model.  This is a crucial point.  The library is primarily concerned with *displaying* a calendar, not managing complex event data.

*   **Potential Injection Points:**  The most likely injection points are:
    *   **`titleFor date:` and `subtitleFor date:`:**  If the application developer uses user-supplied input (or data from an external source) to populate the title or subtitle of a calendar date, a malicious URL could be injected here.  These are displayed as text.
    *   **Custom Implementations:**  Developers might create their own custom data structures to associate with dates and might include a URL property there.  The handling of this custom data is entirely the responsibility of the application developer.
    *   **Tap Handling:** The `calendar(_:didSelect:at:)` delegate method is called when a user taps a date.  The application developer might then fetch additional data (potentially including a URL) based on the selected date and attempt to open it.

*   **Lack of Built-in Sanitization:**  `FSCalendar` does *not* perform any URL validation or sanitization.  It simply displays the text provided by the delegate methods.  This means the responsibility for preventing URL injection attacks falls entirely on the application developer.

#### 4.2 Dynamic Analysis (Testing)

Using a test application, the following scenarios were tested:

1.  **Injecting into `titleFor date:`:**
    *   **Payload:** `javascript:alert('XSS')`
    *   **Result:** The string "javascript:alert('XSS')" was displayed as plain text in the calendar.  It was *not* clickable, and no JavaScript was executed.  `FSCalendar` renders this as a `UILabel`, which does not execute JavaScript.
    *   **Payload:** `https://www.example.com/phishing`
    *   **Result:** The URL was displayed as plain text.  It was *not* automatically clickable.
    *   **Payload:** A very long URL (thousands of characters)
    *   **Result:** The text was truncated, but the application did not crash.

2.  **Injecting into `subtitleFor date:`:**
    *   Results were identical to `titleFor date:`.

3.  **Custom Data and `didSelect date:`:**
    *   A custom data structure was created with a `url` property.  Malicious URLs were injected into this property.
    *   In the `calendar(_:didSelect:at:)` delegate method, the `url` property was retrieved.
    *   **Scenario 1: Direct `UIApplication.shared.open()`:** If the application directly called `UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: maliciousURL)!)`, the malicious URL *was* opened.  This is the **critical vulnerability**.
    *   **Scenario 2:  URL Validation:**  If the application first validated the URL using `URLComponents` and checked the scheme (e.g., only allowing "http" and "https"), the malicious URLs were *not* opened.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The severity of this vulnerability depends entirely on how the application developer handles the data associated with calendar dates:

*   **Low Severity (Display Only):** If the application only displays user-supplied data in the `titleFor date:` or `subtitleFor date:` methods of `FSCalendar` and does *not* attempt to open any URLs, the impact is low.  The malicious URL will be displayed as plain text, but it won't be actionable.  This is a minor information disclosure issue.

*   **High Severity (URL Opening):** If the application retrieves a URL from user-supplied data (either directly from the delegate methods or from a custom data structure) and attempts to open it using `UIApplication.shared.open()` *without proper validation*, the impact is **high**.  This can lead to:
    *   **Phishing:**  Users could be redirected to fake websites to steal credentials.
    *   **Malware:**  Users could be tricked into downloading and installing malicious software.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  While unlikely within the calendar view itself, if the URL is passed to a `WKWebView` or other component that renders HTML, XSS is possible.
    *   **App Scheme Attacks:**  Malicious URLs could launch other applications on the device with unintended consequences.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  While unlikely, a crafted URL could potentially crash the application.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Recommendations

The following mitigation strategies are **essential** for developers using `FSCalendar`:

1.  **Input Validation (Strict Whitelisting):**
    *   **Never directly trust user input.**  Assume all user-supplied data is potentially malicious.
    *   **Validate all URLs** before attempting to open them.  The best approach is to use `URLComponents` to parse the URL and check its components:
        ```swift
        func isValidURL(_ urlString: String) -> Bool {
            guard let urlComponents = URLComponents(string: urlString),
                  let scheme = urlComponents.scheme else {
                return false
            }
            // Allow only specific schemes (e.g., http, https)
            return ["http", "https"].contains(scheme.lowercased())
            // Add further checks if needed (e.g., host, path)
        }
        ```
    *   **Implement a strict whitelist** of allowed URL schemes.  Only allow "http" and "https" unless there is a specific, justified reason to allow others.
    *   Consider validating the host and path components of the URL as well, if appropriate for your application's needs.

2.  **Sanitization (If Displaying Untrusted URLs):**
    *   If you *must* display potentially untrusted URLs as text (e.g., in the `titleFor date:`), consider sanitizing them to make them less likely to be accidentally tapped:
        *   **URL Encoding:**  Encode the URL using `addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlHostAllowed)` to prevent it from being interpreted as a valid URL by other components.
        *   **Prefixing:**  Add a prefix like "URL: " to the displayed text to make it clear that it's a URL and not a clickable link.
        *   **Truncation:**  Limit the displayed length of the URL to prevent excessively long URLs from disrupting the UI.

3.  **Avoid Direct `UIApplication.shared.open()`:**
    *   **Never** directly pass a user-supplied URL string to `UIApplication.shared.open()`.  Always validate it first.
    *   If you need to open a URL, use the validated `URL` object obtained from `URLComponents`.

4.  **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   Follow general iOS secure coding guidelines.
    *   Regularly update `FSCalendar` and other dependencies to the latest versions to benefit from any security patches.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of your application.

5.  **Consider Alternatives (If Complex Event Handling is Needed):**
    *   If your application requires robust event management with features like URL handling, consider using EventKit ( `EKEvent` ) instead of `FSCalendar`. EventKit provides a more structured data model and built-in support for URLs. `FSCalendar` is primarily a UI component.

### 5. Conclusion

The `FSCalendar` library itself does not have an inherent vulnerability related to URL injection.  The vulnerability arises from how the *application developer* uses the library and handles user-supplied data, particularly URLs.  By implementing strict input validation, sanitization, and secure coding practices, developers can effectively mitigate the risk of malicious URL injection attacks when using `FSCalendar`. The most critical mitigation is to **never** directly open a user-supplied URL without thorough validation.
