## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Calendar Display/Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_calendar_displaydata__high_risk_.md)

This is the primary attack path, focusing on altering the calendar's appearance or data to the attacker's advantage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Inject Malicious Input into Calendar Data Sources [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_inject_malicious_input_into_calendar_data_sources__high_risk_.md)

This sub-path targets vulnerabilities arising from insufficient input validation and sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Exploit Unsanitized Event Titles/Descriptions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_exploit_unsanitized_event_titlesdescriptions__critical_.md)

Attackers inject malicious code into event details, which are then rendered by the calendar.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Event Data [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_event_data__high_risk___critical_.md)

**Description:**  The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into event titles or descriptions.  When the calendar renders these events, the injected script executes in the context of other users' browsers.
**Likelihood:** High (if input is not sanitized)
**Impact:** High (can lead to account takeover, data theft, session hijacking, defacement)
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
    *   Implement rigorous input sanitization using a well-vetted HTML sanitization library.  Remove or encode all potentially dangerous characters and tags.
    *   Use output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to ensure that any remaining special characters are treated as text, not code.
    *   Employ a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Exploit Unsanitized Custom Cell Content [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_exploit_unsanitized_custom_cell_content__high_risk_.md)

If the application allows users to customize the appearance of calendar cells, attackers can inject malicious code into these customizations.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1 XSS via Custom Cell Renderers [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1_xss_via_custom_cell_renderers__high_risk___critical_.md)

**Description:** Similar to 1.1.1.1, but the injection point is within the custom cell rendering logic.  If the application uses custom cell renderers (delegates or data sources) and doesn't sanitize user-provided data used within them, attackers can inject malicious scripts.
**Likelihood:** Medium (depends on whether custom cell rendering is used and how it's implemented)
**Impact:** High (same as 1.1.1.1)
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
    *   Rigorously sanitize *all* user-provided data used within custom cell renderers.  This includes any data used to generate HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
    *   Apply the same sanitization and encoding techniques as for event data (1.1.1.1).
    *   Consider limiting the customization options available to users to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4 Exploit Unsanitized URL in Event](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_exploit_unsanitized_url_in_event.md)

Attackers inject malicious URLs into event data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4.2 XSS via Event URL (if rendered as a link) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_2_xss_via_event_url__if_rendered_as_a_link___high_risk_.md)

**Description:** If the calendar renders URLs from event data as clickable links *without* proper sanitization, an attacker can inject a `javascript:` URL or other malicious URL schemes that execute code when clicked.
**Likelihood:** Medium (if URLs are rendered as links without sanitization)
**Impact:** High (same as 1.1.1.1)
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
    *   Sanitize and encode URLs before rendering them as HTML links.  Use a URL sanitization library to remove or encode dangerous characters and schemes.
    *   Validate URLs against a whitelist of allowed schemes (e.g., `http:`, `https:`) and, if possible, a whitelist of allowed domains.
    *   Consider using a `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute on links to prevent the opened page from accessing the opener window.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Tamper with Calendar Configuration/Appearance](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_tamper_with_calendar_configurationappearance.md)

This path focuses on manipulating the calendar's settings or appearance, potentially to mislead users or disrupt service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Bypass Access Controls to Modify Other Users' Calendars [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_bypass_access_controls_to_modify_other_users'_calendars__high_risk_.md)

Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to modify other users' calendar data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1 Insufficient Authorization Checks on Calendar Data Updates [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1_insufficient_authorization_checks_on_calendar_data_updates__high_risk___critical_.md)

**Description:** The application lacks proper authorization checks, allowing a user to modify calendar data belonging to other users.  This could involve changing event details, deleting events, or adding unauthorized events.
**Likelihood:** Medium (if authorization is not properly implemented)
**Impact:** High (data breach, data modification, data loss, privacy violation)
**Effort:** Medium
**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard
**Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust server-side authorization checks on *every* API endpoint that interacts with calendar data.
    *   Verify that the currently authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action (create, read, update, delete) on the specific calendar data.
    *   Use a consistent and well-defined authorization model (e.g., Role-Based Access Control - RBAC).
    *   Thoroughly test all authorization logic, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  Use automated testing and manual penetration testing.
    *   Log all authorization failures for auditing and monitoring.
