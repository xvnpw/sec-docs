# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for wenchaod/fscalendar

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (for FSCalendar Display)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__for_fscalendar_display_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify FSCalendar Display Points:** Pinpoint exactly where user-provided data is displayed within `FSCalendar` (e.g., event titles in `calendar(_:titleFor:)`, subtitles in `calendar(_:subtitleFor:)`, custom views).
2.  **Sanitize Before Passing:** *Before* returning any string or attributed string to `FSCalendar`'s delegate methods for display, rigorously sanitize the data using a dedicated library (e.g., DOMPurify if within a web view, a native Swift sanitizer, or a backend sanitizer if data is pre-processed).
3.  **Allowlist Approach:** Use a strict allowlist, defining precisely which characters and (if any) HTML tags are permitted within each display context. Reject anything outside the allowlist.
4.  **Context-Specific Sanitization:** Sanitize data differently depending on where it will be displayed.  A title might have stricter rules than a longer description.
5.  **Output Encoding (if applicable):** If you are manually constructing attributed strings or custom views, ensure proper output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to prevent misinterpretation.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (within FSCalendar):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript if `FSCalendar` is used within a web view or if it renders HTML content.
*   **HTML Injection (within FSCalendar):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary HTML that could disrupt the calendar's appearance or display unwanted content.
*   **Data Corruption (within FSCalendar):** (Severity: Low) - Prevents malformed input from causing rendering errors within `FSCalendar`.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Very Low (with proper sanitization and CSP).
*   **HTML Injection:** Risk reduced from Medium to Very Low.
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Partially implemented. Basic sanitization is done before setting event titles, but it's not comprehensive and doesn't use a dedicated library. Subtitles and custom views are not sanitized."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Missing a robust sanitization library. The custom sanitization function needs to be replaced. Sanitization is missing for subtitles and any custom views used within `FSCalendar`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Delegate Implementation (FSCalendar-Specific Data Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_delegate_implementation__fscalendar-specific_data_handling_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Focus on FSCalendar Delegates:** Review *only* the `FSCalendarDelegate` and `FSCalendarDataSource` methods your application implements.
2.  **Minimize Data Exposure:** Within these delegate methods, *only* access and process the data absolutely required by `FSCalendar`. Avoid accessing or manipulating unrelated data.
3.  **Secure Data Handling:** If delegate methods handle data that will be used *outside* of `FSCalendar` (e.g., sending it to a server, storing it locally):
    *   **Sanitize Before External Use:** Sanitize the data *again* before sending it elsewhere, even if it was sanitized before being displayed in `FSCalendar`. This provides defense-in-depth.
    *   **Secure Communication:** Use HTTPS for any network communication.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Use appropriate secure storage mechanisms.
4.  **Avoid Sensitive Operations in Delegates:** Do not perform security-sensitive operations (e.g., authentication, authorization) directly within `FSCalendar` delegate methods.  These should be handled separately.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Leakage (via FSCalendar Delegates):** (Severity: High) - Prevents sensitive data from being exposed if delegate methods inadvertently log, transmit, or store data insecurely.
*   **Injection Attacks (indirect):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of data passed *from* `FSCalendar` being used in injection attacks elsewhere in the application.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from High to Low (depending on the data and implementation).
*   **Injection Attacks (indirect):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Implemented. Delegate methods only access necessary data. Data passed to the backend is sanitized again before transmission."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Needs review to ensure no unnecessary data is being accessed within the delegate methods."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Appearance Customization (FSCalendar-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_appearance_customization__fscalendar-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Limit Customization Options:** Restrict the range of appearance customizations users can control through `FSCalendar`.  Do *not* allow arbitrary CSS or styling. Provide a predefined set of safe options (e.g., colors, fonts from a fixed list).
2.  **Validate Customization Data:** If users can provide input for customizations (e.g., color codes), validate this input *before* passing it to `FSCalendar`'s appearance methods.
3.  **Image Handling (if applicable):** If `FSCalendar` is used to display custom images (e.g., for events):
    *   **Source Control:** Load images only from trusted sources (your server, a CDN).
    *   **Validation:** Validate image types and sizes *before* passing them to `FSCalendar`.
    *   **Avoid User-Provided URLs:** Do *not* allow users to directly provide URLs to images to be displayed in `FSCalendar`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **UI Distortion/Breakage (within FSCalendar):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents malicious or poorly designed customizations from disrupting `FSCalendar`'s layout.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Image Loading (within FSCalendar):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents large or malicious images from causing `FSCalendar` to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (indirect, via images):** (Severity: Low) - Reduces the risk if images are loaded from untrusted sources.

**Impact:**
*   **UI Distortion/Breakage:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **DoS via Image Loading:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **XSS (indirect):** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Partially implemented. Users can choose from a predefined set of colors. Image customization is not used."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "If image customization is added, image validation and secure loading will be required."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pagination/Lazy Loading (with FSCalendar)](./mitigation_strategies/paginationlazy_loading__with_fscalendar_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Implement Data Fetching Logic:** Modify your `FSCalendarDataSource` implementation to fetch event data in batches, rather than all at once.
2.  **Use Delegate Methods for Triggers:** Utilize `FSCalendar` delegate methods like `calendar(_:willDisplay:for:)` or methods related to scrolling/paging to trigger the loading of additional data as the user navigates the calendar.
3.  **Manage Visible Date Range:** Keep track of the currently visible date range and only fetch events within that range (plus a small buffer, if desired).
4.  **Handle Loading Indicators:** Display appropriate loading indicators within `FSCalendar` (e.g., using custom views or appearance customizations) to inform the user when data is being fetched.
5. **Cache Data (Optional):** Consider caching fetched event data to improve performance, but be mindful of data freshness and potential memory usage.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (on FSCalendar):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents `FSCalendar` from becoming unresponsive due to a large number of events.
*   **Performance Degradation (within FSCalendar):** (Severity: Medium) - Improves the responsiveness of `FSCalendar`, especially with large datasets.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Not implemented."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Requires modifying the `FSCalendarDataSource` implementation to fetch data in batches and using delegate methods to trigger loading."
