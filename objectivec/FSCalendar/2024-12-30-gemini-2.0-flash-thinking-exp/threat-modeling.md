### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving FSCalendar:

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Event Titles/Descriptions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into event titles or descriptions. When FSCalendar renders these events, the injected script will execute in the victim's browser. This could involve stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application for the user, or further propagation of attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The rendering logic of FSCalendar responsible for displaying event details, specifically the parts that handle event titles and descriptions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on the server-side to sanitize event titles and descriptions before storing them.
        *   Utilize output encoding (HTML escaping) when rendering event data within FSCalendar to prevent the browser from interpreting injected scripts.

*   **Threat:** DOM-Based XSS via Custom Cell Configuration
    *   **Description:** If the application uses FSCalendar's customization features to render dynamic content within calendar cells, an attacker could craft malicious data that, when processed by the custom rendering logic *within FSCalendar*, injects and executes JavaScript in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to regular XSS, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution, potentially compromising the user's session or data.
    *   **Affected Component:** FSCalendar's API and rendering logic for custom cell configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and encode any data used within the custom cell rendering logic before it is passed to FSCalendar for rendering.
        *   Avoid directly injecting user-provided data into FSCalendar's custom cell rendering without proper sanitization.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies
    *   **Description:** FSCalendar might rely on external libraries. If these dependencies contain security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through FSCalendar's usage of the affected dependency. This could involve various attack vectors depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific third-party library or module within that library that FSCalendar depends on.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update FSCalendar to the latest version to benefit from dependency updates and security patches.
        *   Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in FSCalendar's dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for FSCalendar and its dependencies.
