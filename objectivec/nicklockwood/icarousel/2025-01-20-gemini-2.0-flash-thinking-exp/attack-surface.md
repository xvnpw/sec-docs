# Attack Surface Analysis for nicklockwood/icarousel

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image URLs](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_urls.md)

* **Description:** The application uses URLs provided to iCarousel to display images. If these URLs are not properly validated, an attacker can inject malicious URLs.
    * **How iCarousel Contributes:** iCarousel directly fetches and displays images from the provided URLs. It doesn't inherently sanitize or validate these URLs.
    * **Example:** An attacker could provide a URL like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` (if the image loading mechanism doesn't properly handle this) or a URL pointing to an internal service (`http://localhost:8080/sensitive-data`).
    * **Impact:**
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the image loading mechanism is vulnerable, malicious JavaScript could be executed in the user's browser.
        * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application's server could be tricked into making requests to internal or external resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing other damage.
        * **Data Exfiltration:** A malicious URL could point to an attacker-controlled server, allowing them to track when and how often the image is loaded, potentially revealing user activity.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of image URLs on the server-side before providing them to iCarousel. Use allowlists of trusted domains or URL patterns.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which images can be loaded.
        * **Sanitization:** If direct URL control is necessary, sanitize URLs to remove potentially harmful characters or protocols.
        * **Use Secure Protocols (HTTPS):** Ensure all image URLs use HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data in Custom Views](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_in_custom_views.md)

* **Description:** The application uses custom views within iCarousel and populates them with data from potentially untrusted sources.
    * **How iCarousel Contributes:** iCarousel provides a mechanism to display custom views, and the application is responsible for populating these views with data. If this data is not sanitized, vulnerabilities can arise when iCarousel renders these views.
    * **Example:** If a custom view displays user-provided text without sanitization, an attacker could inject HTML or JavaScript code that gets rendered within the view by iCarousel, leading to XSS.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts can be injected and executed within the context of the application.
        * **UI Redressing/Clickjacking:** Attackers might manipulate the content or layout of custom views to trick users into performing unintended actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Properly encode or escape all user-provided data before displaying it in custom views to prevent the interpretation of malicious code by the rendering engine.
        * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input on the server-side before it reaches the client and is used to populate custom views.
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines when developing custom views, avoiding the direct rendering of untrusted HTML.
