# Threat Model Analysis for nicklockwood/icarousel

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the content of carousel items if the application doesn't properly sanitize data before passing it to `iCarousel`. The attacker manipulates data sources or user inputs to include `<script>` tags or other executable code. When `iCarousel` renders this unsanitized content, the malicious script executes in the user's browser *because of how `iCarousel` processes and displays the provided HTML or text*.

**Impact:** Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking (stealing cookies), redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application, or execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser, potentially compromising their system or data. This is a direct consequence of `iCarousel` rendering the malicious payload.

**Affected iCarousel Component:** `iCarousel`'s item rendering logic, specifically when displaying the `content` or HTML provided for each carousel item. The vulnerability lies in `iCarousel`'s handling of potentially unsafe input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all data that will be displayed within the `iCarousel`. Ensure that any HTML or JavaScript within the carousel item data is properly escaped or sanitized *before* being passed to `iCarousel`.
*   Use context-aware escaping techniques (e.g., HTML escaping for text content).
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS even if it occurs within the `iCarousel`.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Maliciously Crafted Carousel Item Data](./threats/data_injection_through_maliciously_crafted_carousel_item_data.md)

**Description:** If the application fetches carousel item data from an external source without proper validation, an attacker could compromise that source and inject malicious data. This malicious data, when rendered by `iCarousel`, could lead to unexpected behavior or even client-side vulnerabilities if the data contains executable code or malicious links. The vulnerability arises because `iCarousel` trusts the data it receives and renders it accordingly.

**Impact:** Similar to XSS, this could lead to malicious scripts executing in the user's browser, redirection to harmful sites, or the display of misleading or harmful content. The impact is directly tied to what `iCarousel` renders based on the injected data.

**Affected iCarousel Component:** `iCarousel`'s item rendering logic and the way it processes the data provided for each item. The core issue is `iCarousel`'s reliance on the application to provide safe data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data fetched from external sources *before* using it to populate the `iCarousel`. This ensures that `iCarousel` only receives safe data to render.
*   Implement secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) to protect data in transit.
*   Verify the integrity of the data source.
