# Attack Surface Analysis for nicklockwood/icarousel

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Source](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_source.md)

Attackers inject malicious content into the data source used to populate the iCarousel.

*   **iCarousel Contribution:** iCarousel displays the provided data, acting as the *direct* conduit for the malicious content to reach the user or application. This is a direct involvement because iCarousel is the component rendering the potentially malicious data.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a JavaScript payload (XSS) into a text field that is then displayed within an iCarousel item. Another example: attacker injects URL to the malicious website.
*   **Impact:** Code execution (XSS), data theft, phishing, application compromise, denial of service (if the malicious data consumes excessive resources).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on how the data is used and the lack of sanitization).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement *strict* input validation and sanitization for *all* data used to populate the iCarousel, regardless of source.  This is paramount. Use output encoding/escaping appropriate for the context (e.g., HTML encoding for text, URL encoding for URLs).  Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be loaded. Validate data types rigorously.  Never trust data from external sources.
    *   **Users:** (Limited direct mitigation; relies entirely on developer implementation).

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Custom Views (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_custom_views__if_applicable_.md)

If the application allows user-controlled input to influence the creation or configuration of custom views *within* the iCarousel, attackers could inject malicious code.

*   **iCarousel Contribution:** iCarousel *directly* displays and renders these custom views, making it the immediate point of execution for any injected malicious code.
*   **Example:** If a custom view renders user-provided HTML without sanitization, an attacker could inject a `<script>` tag containing malicious JavaScript (XSS).
*   **Impact:** Code execution (XSS), data theft, phishing, application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (if user-provided content is used in custom views without *any* sanitization).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Treat custom views as *completely* untrusted if they incorporate *any* user-provided data.  Implement rigorous sanitization and validation of *all* data used in the creation and configuration of custom views.  Use output encoding/escaping as appropriate (HTML encoding, etc.).  Apply the principle of least privilege â€“ only grant the custom view the absolute minimum necessary permissions.  Assume any user-influenced part of the custom view is a potential attack vector.
    *   **Users:** (No direct mitigation; relies entirely on developer implementation).
