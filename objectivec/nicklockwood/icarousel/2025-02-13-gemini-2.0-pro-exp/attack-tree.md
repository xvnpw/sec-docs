## Attack Tree Path: [1. Inject Malicious Content [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__inject_malicious_content__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching category for attacks that aim to insert malicious code or data into the carousel.  This is considered critical because successful injection can lead to various severe consequences.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Data Source Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_data_source_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  This focuses on vulnerabilities in how data is provided to `iCarousel`.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Unsanitized Input from Server (If iCarousel uses server-provided data) [HIGH-RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_unsanitized_input_from_server__if_icarousel_uses_server-provided_data___high-risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker exploits a lack of input validation and sanitization on the server-side.  If the server sends data to the client without proper checks, the attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., XSS payloads, HTML, JavaScript) that will be rendered by `iCarousel`.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on existing server-side security)
                *   **Impact:** High to Very High (XSS, data exfiltration, phishing, session hijacking)
                *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
                *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict server-side input validation and output encoding.  Use parameterized queries for database interactions.  Treat *all* data from the server as potentially malicious.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Client-Side Data Manipulation (If iCarousel uses client-side data sources) [HIGH-RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_client-side_data_manipulation__if_icarousel_uses_client-side_data_sources___high-risk___critic_37d65f23.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker manipulates data sources on the client-side (e.g., JavaScript variables, local storage, URL parameters) that are used to populate the `iCarousel`.  Even if the server is secure, if the client-side code doesn't validate this data, an attacker can inject malicious content.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on client-side security measures)
                *   **Impact:** Medium to High (XSS, UI manipulation, potentially leading to further attacks)
                *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
                *   **Mitigation:**  Implement rigorous client-side input validation and sanitization.  Assume that *any* data originating from the client-side can be manipulated by an attacker.  Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be loaded.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Weaknesses in Custom View Handling](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_weaknesses_in_custom_view_handling.md)

*        **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Inject Malicious Code into Custom Views [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_inject_malicious_code_into_custom_views__critical_.md)

*    **Description:** If `iCarousel` is configured to use custom views, and those custom views have vulnerabilities, an attacker can inject malicious code through the data provided to those views. This is similar to 1.1.1 and 1.1.2, but specifically targets the custom view implementation.
                *    **Likelihood:** Medium (if custom views are used and lack proper validation)
                *    **Impact:** Medium to High (XSS, UI manipulation within the custom view, potentially affecting the entire carousel)
                *    **Effort:** Low to Medium
                *    **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                *    **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *    **Mitigation:** Treat custom views as untrusted entry points.  Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* data used within custom views, regardless of its source.  Apply the same security principles as you would to server-side and client-side code.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Trigger Unintended Actions](./attack_tree_paths/3__trigger_unintended_actions.md)

*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Exploit Delegate/Callback Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_exploit_delegatecallback_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This category focuses on attacks that manipulate the delegate or callback mechanisms of `iCarousel`.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.3 Hijack Control Flow via Delegates [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_3_hijack_control_flow_via_delegates__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  This is a sophisticated attack where the attacker manipulates the delegate methods or callbacks to alter the application's control flow.  This could involve causing the application to execute unintended code, bypass security checks, or perform actions that it shouldn't.
                *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a deep understanding of the application's logic and the `iCarousel` API)
                *   **Impact:** High to Very High (could grant the attacker significant control over the application)
                *   **Effort:** High
                *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
                *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid using delegate methods for critical security decisions.  Implement robust security checks *independently* of delegate callbacks.  Carefully validate any data passed to delegate methods.  Consider using a more secure communication pattern if possible.
