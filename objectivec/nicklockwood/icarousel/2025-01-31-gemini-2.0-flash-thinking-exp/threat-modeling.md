# Threat Model Analysis for nicklockwood/icarousel

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data that is used to populate the iCarousel. When iCarousel renders this data into the DOM, the malicious script executes in the user's browser. This can be achieved by manipulating data sources, such as URL parameters, form inputs, or external APIs, if they are not properly sanitized before being used by iCarousel.
**Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft (including sensitive user information), website defacement, redirection to malicious websites, installation of malware on the user's machine.
**iCarousel Component Affected:** Data rendering and DOM manipulation within iCarousel, specifically when processing data provided to populate carousel items.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:**  Strictly sanitize and encode all data used to populate the carousel items *before* passing it to iCarousel. Use appropriate HTML entity encoding for text content and attribute encoding for attributes.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP header to control the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute, significantly reducing the impact of XSS attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review the application's code and data handling practices to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Use a Security Scanner:** Employ automated security scanners to detect potential XSS vulnerabilities in the application.
