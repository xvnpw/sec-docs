# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: Provide iOS and tvOS developers with a reusable, customizable, and visually appealing carousel component.
 - Priority: Ease of integration and use for developers.
 - Priority: Performance and stability to ensure smooth user experience in applications using the library.
 - Priority: Compatibility with a wide range of iOS and tvOS versions.
 - Priority: Open-source and community-driven development to encourage adoption and contributions.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Bugs or instability in the library could negatively impact applications using it, leading to poor user experience and developer dissatisfaction.
 - Risk: Lack of adoption by developers if the library is not well-documented, easy to use, or performant.
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the library, although less likely for a UI component, could be exploited if the library processes untrusted data or interacts with other components insecurely.
 - Risk: Compatibility issues with new iOS/tvOS versions could require ongoing maintenance and updates.
 - Risk: Dependency on a single maintainer or small group of contributors could lead to project stagnation if maintainers become unavailable.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Open-source code, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Use of Objective-C and standard iOS/tvOS SDKs, which have established security practices. Implemented in: Source code.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on developers to use the library correctly and securely within their applications.
 - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or audits of the library itself.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement static code analysis tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities in the library code.
 - security control: Encourage community security reviews and contributions to identify and fix potential issues.
 - security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities, even if they are considered low risk for a UI library.
 - security control: Consider adding basic input validation if the library accepts any external data or configuration that could be manipulated by developers.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not applicable for a UI library. Authentication is handled by the applications using the library.
 - Authorization: Not applicable for a UI library. Authorization is handled by the applications using the library.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: If the library accepts any configuration parameters or data from developers (e.g., data sources, styling options), validate these inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities in applications using the library.
  - Implementation: Input validation should be implemented within the library's code to ensure robustness.
 - Cryptography: Not expected to be required for a UI library focused on UI components. If any data needs to be stored or transmitted securely by applications using the library, it is the responsibility of those applications, not the library itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Enabling developers to create visually appealing and functional iOS/tvOS applications efficiently.
 - Maintaining the reputation and trust in the open-source iCarousel library within the developer community.
 - Ensuring the stability and performance of applications that use the iCarousel library.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Source code of the iCarousel library: High sensitivity - Intellectual property, integrity is crucial to prevent malicious modifications.
 - Library packages distributed via dependency managers: High sensitivity - Integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure developers are using the genuine library.
 - Developer and community contributions: Medium sensitivity - Maintaining contributor trust and ensuring proper attribution.
 - User data within applications using iCarousel: Sensitivity depends on the application itself, but iCarousel itself is not expected to handle sensitive user data directly. The focus is on the integrity and availability of the library code and packages.
