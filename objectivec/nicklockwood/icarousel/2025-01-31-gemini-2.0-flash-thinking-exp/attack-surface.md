## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized Image Paths/URLs leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or Information Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_image_pathsurls_leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__or_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising when an application using `iCarousel` processes user-provided or dynamically generated image paths/URLs server-side without proper validation, potentially leading to SSRF or information disclosure.
*   **iCarousel Contribution:** `iCarousel` is designed to display images based on provided paths or URLs. If the application uses `iCarousel` to display images whose paths/URLs are derived from user input and processed server-side (e.g., for fetching or serving images), `iCarousel` becomes a component in the attack chain.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to customize their carousel by specifying image URLs. If the backend server fetches images based on these URLs without validation, a malicious user could provide a URL pointing to an internal service (e.g., `http://internal-admin-panel`) via `iCarousel` configuration, leading to SSRF.  Alternatively, if the application directly serves files based on user-provided paths, path traversal might be possible.
*   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) enabling access to internal resources, potentially leading to further exploitation of internal systems. Information Disclosure if path traversal is possible, allowing access to sensitive files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side URL Validation:** On the server-side, rigorously validate all image URLs provided to `iCarousel` (or derived from user input used with `iCarousel`) before processing them. Use strict allowlists for allowed domains and protocols.
    *   **Avoid Server-Side URL Processing of User Input (if possible):**  Ideally, avoid directly processing user-provided URLs server-side for image retrieval.  Instead, use pre-defined, server-controlled image lists or proxy image requests through a controlled service that performs validation.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the origins from which images can be loaded, providing a defense-in-depth layer against SSRF.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Server-Side):** Ensure the server-side component handling image requests has minimal necessary privileges to reduce the impact of SSRF exploitation.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of Configuration Options leading to DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_configuration_options_leading_to_dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising when an application reflects user-controlled data into the Document Object Model (DOM) through `iCarousel` configuration or related application logic, without proper output encoding, allowing execution of malicious scripts.
*   **iCarousel Contribution:** If the application dynamically generates `iCarousel` configuration options based on user input and renders these options into the HTML (even indirectly through JavaScript manipulation of the DOM), and if this rendering is not properly encoded, it can create a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. `iCarousel` becomes the context where this potentially malicious configuration is applied.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom carousel title, and this title is then dynamically inserted into the DOM within the `iCarousel` container using JavaScript based on user input. If the title is not HTML-encoded before insertion, a malicious user could set a title like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` which would execute JavaScript when the `iCarousel` is rendered.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the application's context. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, and other malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Configuration Based on User Input (if possible):**  Minimize or eliminate the practice of dynamically generating `iCarousel` configuration options directly from user input, especially if these options are rendered into the DOM.
    *   **Strict Output Encoding:** If user input *must* influence `iCarousel` configuration and be rendered into the DOM, rigorously encode the user input for the HTML context *before* it is used to construct or modify the DOM. Use context-aware encoding functions appropriate for HTML.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS by controlling the sources from which scripts can be executed and restricting inline script execution.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities related to dynamic content rendering and `iCarousel` integration.
