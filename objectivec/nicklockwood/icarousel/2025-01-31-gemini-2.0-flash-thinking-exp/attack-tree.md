## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Compromise Application User via iCarousel [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_compromise_application_user_via_icarousel__cn_.md)

*   This is the overarching objective. Success means the attacker has achieved some level of compromise affecting the application user through vulnerabilities or misuse related to the iCarousel library.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in iCarousel Library Code [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_icarousel_library_code__cn_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Exploiting inherent flaws within the iCarousel library's code itself.
*   **Focus:** Identifying and leveraging bugs in iCarousel's implementation.
*   **Potential Outcomes:** Code execution, application crash, denial of service, information disclosure (depending on the specific vulnerability).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Memory safety issues within iCarousel.
*   **Specific Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow in Data Handling:**
        *   **Action:** Provide excessively large or malformed data (images, views) to iCarousel.
        *   **Mechanism:** Overwhelm iCarousel's data processing, causing it to write beyond allocated memory buffers.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Code execution if attacker can control overwritten memory, application crash, denial of service.
    *   **Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Action:** Manipulate carousel state (rapid scrolling, view recycling) to trigger use-after-free.
        *   **Mechanism:** Exploit flaws in iCarousel's object lifecycle management, accessing memory that has been freed.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Code execution if attacker can control freed memory, application crash, denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Insecure Application Usage of iCarousel [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_insecure_application_usage_of_icarousel__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* iCarousel, rather than flaws in iCarousel itself.
*   **Focus:** Identifying insecure coding practices in the application's integration with iCarousel.
*   **Potential Outcomes:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Path Traversal, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Insecure Data Handling Passed to iCarousel [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__insecure_data_handling_passed_to_icarousel__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:**  Specifically targeting the data that the application provides to iCarousel for display or processing.
*   **Focus:**  Exploiting lack of input validation and sanitization in application code when feeding data to iCarousel.
*   **Potential Outcomes:** XSS, Path Traversal, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Displaying Untrusted Content without Sanitization [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__displaying_untrusted_content_without_sanitization__hr_.md)

*   **Attack Vector Category:**  Failing to properly sanitize untrusted content before displaying it within iCarousel views.
*   **Specific Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Untrusted HTML/JavaScript:**
        *   **Action:** Inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into data displayed by iCarousel (especially if using web views within carousel items).
        *   **Mechanism:** If the application renders HTML content provided by users or external sources without sanitization, injected scripts can execute in the user's browser/webview context.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.
    *   **Path Traversal via Untrusted URLs/File Paths:**
        *   **Action:** Inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../sensitive_file`) into URLs or file paths used by iCarousel to load resources.
        *   **Mechanism:** If the application uses user-controlled data to construct file paths for iCarousel to load resources (images, etc.) without proper validation, attackers can access files outside the intended directory.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files on the user's device or server.
