# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-swift

## Attack Surface: [Local Data Storage Exposure](./attack_surfaces/local_data_storage_exposure.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data stored within the Realm database file is accessible if the device is compromised or if the file is inadvertently exposed.

**How Realm-Swift Contributes:** Realm-Swift is responsible for creating and managing the local database file where application data is persisted. If this file is not adequately protected, the data within is vulnerable.

**Example:** A malicious application on the same device gains read access to the Realm database file and extracts user credentials or personal information.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential identity theft, privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement Strong Encryption:** Utilize Realm's built-in encryption features to encrypt the database file at rest. Ensure a strong encryption key management strategy is in place.
* **Secure File Permissions:**  Ensure the Realm database file and its associated files have restrictive file system permissions, limiting access to only the application itself.

## Attack Surface: [Realm Query Language (RQL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/realm_query_language__rql__injection.md)

**Description:** If user-provided input is directly incorporated into Realm queries without proper sanitization, malicious actors could inject RQL code to access or manipulate data beyond their intended scope.

**How Realm-Swift Contributes:** Realm-Swift provides its own query language (RQL). If developers construct queries dynamically using unsanitized input, it creates an injection vulnerability.

**Example:** An application allows users to search for items by name. A malicious user enters an input like `"name == 'item' || TRUE"` which could bypass intended filtering and return all items.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data exfiltration, data modification, potential for privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Parameterized Queries:**  Utilize Realm's features for parameterized queries or predicates to prevent direct injection of user input into the query string.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it in Realm queries.

## Attack Surface: [Realm Sync Vulnerabilities (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/realm_sync_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

**Description:** When using Realm Sync, vulnerabilities can arise in the communication between the client application and the Realm Object Server, or within the server itself.

**How Realm-Swift Contributes:** Realm-Swift handles the client-side of the synchronization process, including establishing connections, authenticating, and exchanging data with the server.

**Example:**
* **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:**  If TLS/SSL is not properly implemented or configured, an attacker could intercept and potentially modify data being synchronized.
* **Weak Authentication:**  If the Realm Object Server uses weak authentication mechanisms, attackers could gain unauthorized access to synchronized data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, denial of service, account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Ensure all communication between the client and the Realm Object Server is encrypted using strong TLS/SSL protocols.
* **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms on the Realm Object Server.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Configuration](./attack_surfaces/improper_configuration.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configuring Realm-Swift can introduce security vulnerabilities.

**How Realm-Swift Contributes:**  Realm-Swift offers various configuration options, and incorrect settings can weaken security.

**Example:** A developer might mistakenly disable database encryption during development and forget to re-enable it for production.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to security best practices when configuring Realm-Swift.
* **Review Configuration Settings:**  Thoroughly review all configuration settings before deploying the application.
