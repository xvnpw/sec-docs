# Threat Model Analysis for realm/realm-swift

## Threat: [Unencrypted Realm File on Disk](./threats/unencrypted_realm_file_on_disk.md)

**Description:** If Realm encryption is not enabled, the `realm-swift` library will store the data in plain text on the device's file system. An attacker with physical access or the ability to browse the file system can directly access and read the contents of the Realm file.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all data managed by `realm-swift`. Confidential user data can be exposed, leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or financial loss.

**Affected Component:** Realm File Storage (within `realm-swift`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable Realm encryption when initializing the Realm configuration.
*   Ensure the encryption key is generated securely and stored using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS).

## Threat: [Weak Encryption Key Management](./threats/weak_encryption_key_management.md)

**Description:** While `realm-swift` provides encryption, the security relies heavily on the secure management of the encryption key. If the key is stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, stored in shared preferences without protection), an attacker can retrieve it and decrypt the Realm file managed by `realm-swift`.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all data managed by `realm-swift`, as the attacker can decrypt the file.

**Affected Component:** Encryption Module (within `realm-swift`), Key Management (external, but critical to `realm-swift` security)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use platform-provided secure storage mechanisms (Keychain on iOS) for storing the encryption key.
*   Avoid hardcoding encryption keys in the application code.
*   Implement robust security practices for managing encryption keys in development and deployment environments.

## Threat: [Default or Predictable Encryption Key](./threats/default_or_predictable_encryption_key.md)

**Description:** If the application uses a default or easily guessable encryption key with `realm-swift`, an attacker familiar with the application or common default keys could decrypt the Realm file without needing to retrieve a specifically generated key.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all data managed by `realm-swift`.

**Affected Component:** Encryption Module (within `realm-swift`), Key Generation (application-side, impacting `realm-swift` security)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never use default or predictable encryption keys when configuring `realm-swift`.
*   Generate a unique, cryptographically secure random key for each installation or user.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `realm-swift` Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__realm-swift__library.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, `realm-swift` might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, logic flaws) that could be exploited by a malicious actor. Exploitation could occur through crafted data processed by `realm-swift` or specific API calls.

**Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, from denial of service or application crashes to arbitrary code execution or data breaches affecting data managed by `realm-swift`.

**Affected Component:** Various modules within the `realm-swift` library (e.g., Core, Query Engine, Sync Engine).

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `realm-swift` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and release notes for `realm-swift`.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for data that interacts with `realm-swift` to prevent exploitation through crafted data.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Unvalidated Input in Queries](./threats/data_injection_through_unvalidated_input_in_queries.md)

**Description:** If user-provided data is directly used in Realm Query Language (RQL) queries executed by `realm-swift` without proper validation and sanitization, an attacker could potentially inject malicious RQL code to access or manipulate data they are not authorized to.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the Realm database managed by `realm-swift`.

**Affected Component:** Realm Query Engine (within `realm-swift`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize and validate user input before using it in Realm queries.
*   Use parameterized queries or Realm's query builder to avoid direct string concatenation of user input into queries.

## Threat: [Concurrency Issues Leading to Data Corruption](./threats/concurrency_issues_leading_to_data_corruption.md)

**Description:** If multiple threads or processes access and modify the same Realm file managed by `realm-swift` without proper synchronization mechanisms (Realm's built-in transaction management), it can lead to race conditions and data corruption.

**Impact:** Data corruption and inconsistencies within the Realm database, potentially leading to application instability or incorrect data processing.

**Affected Component:** Realm Core (within `realm-swift`), Transaction Management (within `realm-swift`), Concurrency Handling (within `realm-swift`)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to Realm's threading model and use managed Realm instances within each thread.
*   Perform all write operations within write transactions provided by `realm-swift`.
*   Avoid sharing mutable Realm objects across threads without proper synchronization.
