# Attack Tree Analysis for realm/realm-swift

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access to or manipulate data stored within the Realm database used by the application.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application Data via Realm Swift Exploitation
* **CRITICAL NODE** Gain Direct Access to Realm Database File
    * Exploit Physical Access to Device **HIGH RISK PATH**
        * Acquire Device and Access File System
    * Exploit Backup/Cloud Storage Vulnerabilities **HIGH RISK PATH**
        * **CRITICAL NODE** Access Unencrypted Backups
* Manipulate Application to Interact with Realm Maliciously **HIGH RISK PATH**
    * **CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Realm Query Language Injection **HIGH RISK PATH**
        * Inject Malicious Queries via User Input **HIGH RISK PATH**
```

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Gain Direct Access to Realm Database File](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gain_direct_access_to_realm_database_file.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the attacker achieving direct access to the underlying Realm database file. This bypasses application-level security measures and grants the attacker full access to the data.
*   **Why it's Critical:** Success at this node leads to the most severe impact â€“ complete data compromise. It also serves as the starting point for multiple high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Physical Access to Device](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_physical_access_to_device.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains physical access to the device running the application. This allows them to bypass operating system and application security controls to access the file system and the Realm database file.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (requires physical proximity and opportunity).
*   **Impact:** Critical (full access to the database).
*   **Effort:** Medium (may require overcoming device security).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice (basic file system navigation).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (detection occurs after the fact).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Backup/Cloud Storage Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_backupcloud_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application's Realm database is backed up to local storage or cloud services. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the backup process or storage security to access these backups.
*   **Critical Node within Path: Access Unencrypted Backups**
    *   **Description:**  A specific vulnerability within this path is the presence of unencrypted backups containing the Realm database.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if backups are not properly configured).
    *   **Impact:** Critical (direct access to backup data).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on backup location and security).
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (basic access to storage).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (can be detected by monitoring backup access).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Application to Interact with Realm Maliciously](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_application_to_interact_with_realm_maliciously.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code to interact with the Realm database in unintended and harmful ways.
*   **Critical Node within Path: Exploit Realm Query Language Injection**
    *   **Description:** This critical node focuses on the vulnerability where user input or external data is directly incorporated into Realm queries without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious queries.
    *   **High-Risk Path stemming from Critical Node: Inject Malicious Queries via User Input**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide malicious input through the application's user interface or APIs that is then used to construct and execute harmful Realm queries.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (if input is not sanitized).
        *   **Impact:** High (data breaches, modification, deletion).
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (crafting malicious queries).
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (understanding query languages).
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires monitoring and analysis of database queries).
