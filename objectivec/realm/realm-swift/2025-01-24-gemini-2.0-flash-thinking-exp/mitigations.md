# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for realm/realm-swift

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Realm File Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/enable_realm_file_encryption.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Realm File Encryption
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate a strong encryption key:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create a 256-bit (or stronger) encryption key.
    2.  **Initialize Realm with encryption key:** When configuring the Realm configuration using `Realm.Configuration()`, provide the generated encryption key as the `encryptionKey` property. This is a direct API of `realm-swift`.
    3.  **Securely store the encryption key:** Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms like Keychain (iOS/macOS) or Android Keystore.  This is crucial because the security of Realm encryption relies on the key's secrecy.
    4.  **Test encryption:** Verify encryption by attempting to open the Realm file without the key, confirming it's inaccessible without proper decryption.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach due to Physical Device Access (High Severity):** If a device is compromised, the Realm database file is protected by Realm's encryption, preventing unauthorized data access.
    *   **Data Breach during Device Disposal/Recycling (Medium Severity):**  Ensures data stored in Realm remains confidential even if the device is improperly disposed of.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach due to Physical Device Access (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces risk by making Realm data unreadable without the encryption key.
    *   **Data Breach during Device Disposal/Recycling (Medium Impact):**  Substantially reduces risk, making data recovery from disposed devices extremely difficult.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented for user credential and profile data stored in Realm.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not yet enabled for Realm databases used for caching network responses and temporary data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Realm File Access (Related to Realm File Location)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_realm_file_access__related_to_realm_file_location_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Realm File Access (Related to Realm File Location)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use default Realm file location:** Allow Realm to use its default file location within the application's sandbox. `realm-swift` defaults to secure locations within the app's private directories.
    2.  **Avoid insecure custom locations:**  Do not configure `Realm.Configuration()` to store the Realm database file in publicly accessible locations like the Documents folder or external storage. Stick to locations managed by the OS for application-private data, which is the default behavior of `realm-swift`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access by Other Applications (Low Severity):** Leverages OS-level sandboxing to prevent other apps from directly accessing the Realm database file, relying on the default behavior of `realm-swift` and the OS.
    *   **Accidental Data Exposure due to Incorrect File Placement (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of developers misconfiguring the Realm file path to a less secure location.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access by Other Applications (Low Impact):** Provides basic protection through OS sandboxing, inherent in how `realm-swift` operates by default.
    *   **Accidental Data Exposure due to Incorrect File Placement (Low Impact):** Reduces risk by adhering to secure default file handling of `realm-swift`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented by default as the application uses standard `realm-swift` configuration and default file locations.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No specific missing implementation, but code reviews should ensure no accidental modifications to the default Realm file path are introduced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong User Authentication and Authorization (If Using Realm Sync)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_user_authentication_and_authorization__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong User Authentication and Authorization (If Using Realm Sync)
*   **Description:**

    2.  **Implement Robust Authorization Rules:** Define fine-grained permissions using Realm Sync's permissions system, configurable through Realm Object Server/Cloud and enforced by `realm-swift` clients. Control access to specific Realm objects and fields based on user roles.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions within Realm Sync, leveraging the authorization features of `realm-swift` and Realm Sync.
    4.  **Regular Permission Review:** Periodically review and update Realm Sync permissions to ensure they remain appropriate, using the management tools provided by Realm Object Server/Cloud.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Realm Sync (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing synced data managed by Realm Sync and accessed through `realm-swift`.
    *   **Data Modification by Unauthorized Users (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying synced data within Realm Sync, enforced by `realm-swift` clients and server-side rules.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users gaining unauthorized access to data or functionalities within the Realm Sync system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Realm Sync (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to synced data managed by Realm Sync and accessed via `realm-swift`.
    *   **Data Modification by Unauthorized Users (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized data modification within Realm Sync.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Realm Sync is used with email/password authentication. Basic role-based authorization is in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to refine authorization rules for more granular control and implement scheduled permission reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ensure HTTPS for Realm Sync Communication (If Using Realm Sync)](./mitigation_strategies/ensure_https_for_realm_sync_communication__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure HTTPS for Realm Sync Communication (If Using Realm Sync)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Realm Object Server/Realm Cloud for HTTPS:** Ensure the Realm Object Server or Realm Cloud instance is configured to use HTTPS for all client connections. This is a server-side configuration crucial for secure `realm-swift` client connections.
    2.  **Verify SSL/TLS Certificates:** `realm-swift` clients should automatically verify SSL/TLS certificates of the Realm Object Server/Realm Cloud. Ensure this verification is not disabled in the application code.
    3.  **Enforce HTTPS in Client Configuration:** Explicitly configure `realm-swift` clients to use `https://` URLs when connecting to Realm Object Server/Realm Cloud.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and modifying data transmitted between `realm-swift` applications and the Realm Object Server/Realm Cloud.
    *   **Data Exposure in Transit (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data from being exposed in plain text during network transmission between `realm-swift` clients and the server.
*   **Impact:**

    2.  **Permission Audit:** Audit current Realm Sync permissions, user roles, and access control rules within the Realm Sync system.
    3.  **Identify and Remove Unnecessary Permissions:** Identify and remove overly permissive or unnecessary permissions within Realm Sync, affecting how `realm-swift` clients can interact with data.
    4.  **Update Permissions as Needed:** Update Realm Sync permissions to reflect changes in user roles or application features, ensuring `realm-swift` client access remains appropriate.
    5.  **Document Permission Changes:** Document all changes made to Realm Sync permissions, tracking modifications to access control within the Realm Sync environment.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Creep (Medium Severity):** Prevents accumulation of unnecessary permissions in Realm Sync, reducing potential impact of compromised accounts accessing data via `realm-swift`.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access due to Stale Permissions (Medium Severity):** Ensures permissions remain aligned with current needs, preventing unauthorized access to Realm Sync data through `realm-swift` due to outdated permissions.
