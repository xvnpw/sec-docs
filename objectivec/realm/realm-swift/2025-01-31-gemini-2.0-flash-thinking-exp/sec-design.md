# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Realm Swift project provides a mobile database solution designed for building offline-first and reactive mobile applications. It aims to simplify local data persistence and synchronization for mobile developers, offering a developer-friendly API and efficient data management.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a performant and reliable mobile database solution for iOS and macOS applications.
- Offer a developer-friendly API to reduce development time and complexity related to data persistence.
- Enable offline-first application architectures by providing robust local data storage.
- Support data synchronization capabilities (potentially with Realm Cloud or similar services, though not explicitly stated in the repository itself, it's a common use case for mobile databases).
- Maintain an active open-source community and project.

Business Risks:
- Data breaches due to vulnerabilities in the database library or its usage.
- Data corruption or loss due to software bugs or improper handling of data.
- Performance issues leading to poor user experience and application instability.
- Lack of developer adoption if the library is perceived as insecure, unreliable, or difficult to use.
- Supply chain risks if dependencies are compromised or vulnerabilities are introduced during the build process.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process for contributions (implicitly through GitHub pull requests). Implemented in: GitHub repository contribution guidelines and workflow.
- security control: Reliance on operating system level security features for data storage protection (file system permissions, encryption at rest if enabled by the OS). Implemented in: Operating system level.
- accepted risk:  Security vulnerabilities in dependencies. Accepted risk: Assumed to be managed reactively through dependency updates.
- accepted risk:  Insecure coding practices by developers using the library. Accepted risk: Developers are responsible for secure usage of the library.
- accepted risk:  Lack of built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms within Realm Swift itself. Accepted risk: Assumed to be handled at the application level.

Recommended Security Controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- recommended security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using Realm Swift, focusing on secure data handling, input validation, and encryption.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process for the project.
- recommended security control: Consider providing optional encryption at rest within Realm Swift itself, beyond OS-level encryption, for enhanced control.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Realm Swift itself does not handle user authentication. Applications using Realm Swift are responsible for implementing their own authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
- Authorization: Realm Swift provides a permissions system to control access to Realm objects. Applications should utilize these permissions to enforce authorization policies and ensure users only access data they are allowed to.
- Input Validation: Realm Swift relies on developers to perform input validation on data being stored in the database. Applications must validate data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Cryptography: Realm Swift supports encryption at rest using platform-level encryption features. Applications requiring stronger encryption or encryption in transit need to implement these features at the application level or rely on OS capabilities.

2. CI/CD System (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by code changes.
3. A Build Container (BC) is provisioned in the CI/CD environment.
4. The Build Process (BUILD) is executed within the container, using Swift Package Manager and Xcode Build to compile the Realm Swift library.
5. Recommended Security Checks:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Scanner (SAST) analyzes the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency Scanner (DEP_SCAN) checks for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

BUSINESS POSTURE:
- Question: What is the primary target audience for Realm Swift? Is it all mobile developers or specific industries/application types?
- Assumption: Realm Swift is intended for a broad range of mobile application developers needing local data persistence.
- Question: What is the business model for Realm Swift? Is it purely open-source, or are there commercial offerings (support, enterprise features)?
- Assumption: Realm Swift is primarily an open-source project, potentially with commercial support options available separately (though not evident from the repository itself).

SECURITY POSTURE:
- Question: Are there any specific security features planned for future releases of Realm Swift beyond the current capabilities?
- Assumption: Security enhancements are an ongoing consideration for the project, but specific future features are not detailed in the provided input.
- Question: What are the assumptions about the security posture of applications using Realm Swift? Are developers expected to handle all application-level security, or are there built-in features to assist?
- Assumption: Developers are primarily responsible for application-level security, while Realm Swift focuses on providing a secure and reliable database library within its scope.
- Question: Is there a documented vulnerability reporting and response process for Realm Swift?
- Assumption: A standard open-source vulnerability reporting process is expected, likely through GitHub security advisories, but explicit documentation was not provided in the input.

DESIGN:
- Question: Are there any plans to support cloud synchronization or backend integration directly within Realm Swift itself (beyond potential application-level implementations)?
- Assumption: Cloud synchronization is likely considered an application-level feature or handled by separate Realm products (like Realm Cloud, if still relevant), and not directly within the core Realm Swift library.
- Question: What are the performance and security trade-offs considered in the design of Realm Swift, particularly regarding encryption and data access control?
- Assumption: Performance and ease of use are prioritized, with security features being implemented where they do not significantly impact these aspects, while relying on developers to implement application-specific security measures.
- Question: Are there alternative deployment scenarios for Realm Swift beyond single-device mobile applications (e.g., embedded systems, server-side usage)?
- Assumption: Realm Swift is primarily designed for mobile and macOS applications running on user devices, with limited or no support for server-side or embedded system deployments directly from this library.
