## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Direct Realm File Access [CRITICAL NODE & High-Risk Path]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_direct_realm_file_access__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Direct Realm File Access
*   **Description of the Attack:** An attacker aims to gain unauthorized access to the Realm database file directly on the file system, bypassing the application's access controls and Realm-Swift library's intended usage.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Full data breach - complete access to all data stored in the Realm database.
    *   Data corruption - modification of the database file leading to application malfunction or data loss.
    *   Malicious data injection - insertion of crafted data into the database to manipulate application logic or user experience.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:**
    *   Bypasses application security logic.
    *   Direct access to sensitive data.
    *   Relatively low skill and effort if file permissions are weak or application vulnerabilities exist.
*   **Key Mitigations:**
    *   Implement strict file system permissions, ensuring only the application process has access to the Realm database file.
    *   Secure application code to prevent file access vulnerabilities like path traversal or arbitrary file read.
    *   Employ data-at-rest encryption for the Realm database to protect data even if the file is accessed.
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.
    *   Utilize file system monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect unauthorized access attempts.

    *   **1.1.2. Exploit Application Vulnerability for File Access [CRITICAL NODE & High-Risk Path]:**
        *   **Attack Vector Name:** Application File Access Vulnerability
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the application itself (e.g., path traversal, arbitrary file read) to gain unauthorized file system access and specifically target the Realm database file.
        *   **Mitigation:** Secure application code, implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent file access vulnerabilities. Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Data Exfiltration via File Copy [CRITICAL NODE & High-Risk Path]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__data_exfiltration_via_file_copy__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Realm Data Exfiltration
*   **Description of the Attack:** Once unauthorized file system access is achieved (from 1.1), the attacker copies the entire Realm database file to an external location under their control.
*   **Potential Impact:** Complete data breach, exposure of all sensitive information stored in the Realm database.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Direct and complete data compromise. Relatively easy to execute once file access is gained.
*   **Key Mitigations:**
    *   Prevent unauthorized file system access (mitigations for 1.1).
    *   Implement data-at-rest encryption to minimize impact even if the file is copied.
    *   Deploy file system monitoring and intrusion detection to detect unauthorized file copying attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Data Corruption via Direct File Modification [CRITICAL NODE & High-Risk Path]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__data_corruption_via_direct_file_modification__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Realm Data Corruption
*   **Description of the Attack:** After gaining unauthorized file system access (from 1.1), the attacker directly modifies the Realm database file. This can involve altering existing data, deleting data, or injecting malicious data structures.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Application instability and crashes.
    *   Data integrity loss and corruption.
    *   Denial of Service.
    *   Potential for malicious data injection to manipulate application behavior.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Can severely disrupt application functionality and compromise data integrity. Difficult to detect without proper monitoring.
*   **Key Mitigations:**
    *   Prevent unauthorized file system access (mitigations for 1.1).
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications to the Realm database file. Use checksums or digital signatures to verify file integrity.
    *   Regular backups and data recovery plans to mitigate the impact of data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Data Injection/Modification via Application Input [CRITICAL NODE & High-Risk Path]:](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__data_injectionmodification_via_application_input__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector Name:** Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Realm Data Handling
*   **Description of the Attack:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the application's input validation and sanitization processes when handling user-provided data that is subsequently stored in the Realm database. This allows them to inject malicious or unexpected data.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Data integrity compromise - storing invalid or malicious data in the database.
    *   Application logic manipulation - injected data can alter application behavior.
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) or similar vulnerabilities if data is displayed in a web context.
    *   Data corruption in specific application logic scenarios.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** Input validation is a common vulnerability. Can be exploited with relatively low skill and effort.
*   **Key Mitigations:**
    *   **2.2.1. Application Accepts User Input for Realm Objects [CRITICAL NODE & High-Risk Path]:**
        *   **Attack Vector Name:** Unvalidated User Input for Realm Objects
        *   **Description:** Application directly uses user-provided input to create or modify Realm objects without proper validation.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data before storing it in Realm. Use allow-lists and enforce data type constraints.
    *   **2.2.2. Lack of Input Validation on Realm Object Properties [CRITICAL NODE & High-Risk Path]:**
        *   **Attack Vector Name:** Missing Input Validation on Realm Properties
        *   **Description:** Insufficient or missing validation on individual properties of Realm objects when data is being written.
        *   **Mitigation:** Define a clear schema for Realm objects with data type constraints and validation rules. Implement application-level validation logic to enforce these rules before writing data to Realm.
