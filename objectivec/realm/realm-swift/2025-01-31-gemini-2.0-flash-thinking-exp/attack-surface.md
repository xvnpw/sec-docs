# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-swift

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Realm File Storage](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_realm_file_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Data stored in the Realm database file is not encrypted by default, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access if the device is compromised.
*   **How Realm-Swift Contributes to Attack Surface:** Realm Swift's default storage mechanism is a local, unencrypted file. The framework requires explicit developer action to enable encryption.
*   **Example:** A user's mobile device containing an application using Realm Swift is lost or stolen. If Realm file encryption was not enabled, an attacker gaining physical access to the device's storage could extract and read sensitive data directly from the unencrypted Realm database file, such as user credentials, personal information, or financial details.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Realm File Encryption:**  Developers should always enable Realm's encryption feature during Realm configuration, especially when storing sensitive data. This encrypts the database file on disk using a user-provided encryption key.
    *   **Secure Key Management:** If using Realm encryption, developers must implement secure key management practices. Avoid hardcoding encryption keys within the application. Utilize secure keychains or hardware-backed key storage mechanisms provided by the operating system.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Realm Swift Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_realm_swift_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities might be discovered within the Realm Swift library code itself, potentially affecting all applications using vulnerable versions.
*   **How Realm-Swift Contributes to Attack Surface:** Applications directly depend on the security and integrity of the Realm Swift library. Vulnerabilities in Realm Swift directly translate to vulnerabilities in the applications using it.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in Realm Swift's query processing engine. A malicious actor could craft a specific, malicious query that, when processed by a vulnerable Realm Swift version, triggers the buffer overflow. This could lead to application crashes, memory corruption, or potentially even remote code execution on the device running the application.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of severe impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, significant data breaches, or denial of service affecting application availability and data integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for data breaches or significant denial of service).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Realm Swift:** Developers must diligently keep Realm Swift updated to the latest stable versions. Updates often include critical security patches that address discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Advisories:** Developers should actively monitor Realm's release notes, security advisories published by Realm, and relevant cybersecurity communities for reports of vulnerabilities and recommended update schedules.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into the development process to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in the version of Realm Swift being used and its dependencies. Employ robust dependency management practices to ensure timely updates and vulnerability remediation.
