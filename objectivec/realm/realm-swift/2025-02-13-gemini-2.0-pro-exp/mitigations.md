# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for realm/realm-swift

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption at Rest (Realm API)](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_at_rest__realm_api_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`Realm.Configuration`:** When creating a `Realm.Configuration` object, set the `encryptionKey` property. This is the *core* Realm API for enabling encryption.
2.  **Key Provisioning:** Provide a 64-byte key to the `encryptionKey` property.  (The *source* of this key – secure storage, derivation – is outside the scope of Realm itself).
3.  **`writeCopy(toFile:encryptionKey:)`:**  Use this Realm API method for creating encrypted backups or rotating encryption keys.  It allows you to copy an existing Realm file to a new location, optionally re-encrypting it with a different key.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (File Level):** *Severity: High*.  Directly addresses the threat of someone accessing the Realm file on a compromised device.
    *   **Data Leakage (Physical Device Loss):** *Severity: High*. Protects data if the device is lost.
    *   **Data Tampering (File Level):** *Severity: High*. Prevents unauthorized file modification.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low* (assuming secure key management, which is *external* to Realm).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `Realm.Configuration` with `encryptionKey` is used in `DatabaseManager.swift`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `writeCopy(toFile:encryptionKey:)` is not used for backups or key rotation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Transaction Usage (Realm API)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_transaction_usage__realm_api_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`realm.write { ... }`:**  This is the *fundamental* Realm API for ensuring data consistency.  *All* write operations (create, update, delete) *must* be enclosed within a `realm.write` block.
2.  **Error Handling (within `try-catch`):** While the `try-catch` itself isn't Realm-specific, handling `Realm.Error` *is*.  Catch and appropriately handle Realm-specific errors within the transaction.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Partial Writes):** *Severity: Medium*.  The core purpose of transactions is to prevent partial writes.
    *   **Data Inconsistency:** *Severity: Medium*. Ensures atomic updates.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Data Inconsistency:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `realm.write` is used in most (but potentially not all) write operations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive code review to ensure *all* writes are transactional.
    *   More robust `Realm.Error` handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Migrations (Realm API)](./mitigation_strategies/schema_migrations__realm_api_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`schemaVersion`:**  Increment this property in `Realm.Configuration` whenever the data model changes. This is the trigger for Realm's migration process.
2.  **`migrationBlock`:**  Provide a closure to the `migrationBlock` property of `Realm.Configuration`. This is where you define the *logic* for updating the database schema.
3.  **Realm Migration APIs:**  Within the `migrationBlock`, use Realm-provided methods like:
    *   `migration.renameProperty(onType:oldName:newName:)`
    *   `migration.enumerateObjects(ofType:) { oldObject, newObject in ... }`
    *   Accessing `oldObject` and `newObject` to manipulate data during the migration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Application Crashes (Schema Mismatch):** *Severity: High*.  Prevents crashes due to schema incompatibility.
    *   **Data Loss (Incorrect Migration):** *Severity: High*. Ensures data is correctly updated.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application Crashes:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low* (with thorough testing).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `schemaVersion` and `migrationBlock` are present.
    *   Basic migrations for adding properties are implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Handling property renames.
    *   Comprehensive migration testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Efficient Queries (Realm API)](./mitigation_strategies/efficient_queries__realm_api_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`realm.objects(_:)` with Predicates:** Use `realm.objects(_:)` to retrieve objects, and *always* use predicates (`NSPredicate` or Realm's string-based predicates) to filter results efficiently.
2.  **`filter(_:)`:** Use this method to further refine results based on conditions.
3.  **`sorted(byKeyPath:ascending:)`:** Use for sorting, but be mindful of performance implications on large datasets.
4.  **`limit(_:)`:**  This is a *crucial* Realm API for controlling the number of objects returned, especially for UI display or pagination.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** *Severity: Medium*.  Avoids loading excessive data.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** *Severity: Medium*. Improves responsiveness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `realm.objects(_:)` and `filter(_:)` are used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Widespread use of `limit(_:)` is lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thread Management (Realm API - `ThreadSafeReference`)](./mitigation_strategies/thread_management__realm_api_-__threadsafereference__.md)

**Description:**
1. **Thread Confinement:** Understand that Realm instances are thread-confined. You cannot directly pass Realm objects between threads.
2. **`ThreadSafeReference`:** Use the `ThreadSafeReference` API to *safely* pass a reference to a Realm object from one thread to another.
    *   On the source thread: `let threadSafeRef = ThreadSafeReference(to: myObject)`
    *   On the destination thread: `let realm = try! Realm(); let myObject = realm.resolve(threadSafeRef)`
3. **Background Realm Instances:** Create *separate* Realm instances on each thread that needs to access the database.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Crashes (Thread Confinement Violation):** *Severity: High*. Prevents crashes caused by accessing Realm objects from the wrong thread.
    * **Data Corruption (Race Conditions):** *Severity: Medium*. Helps avoid race conditions when multiple threads access the database concurrently (although transactions are the primary defense).

* **Impact:**
    * **Crashes:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Very Low*.
    * **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from *Medium* to *Low*.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Not implemented.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * `ThreadSafeReference` is not used anywhere in the project. This is a significant gap if multi-threading is used with Realm.
