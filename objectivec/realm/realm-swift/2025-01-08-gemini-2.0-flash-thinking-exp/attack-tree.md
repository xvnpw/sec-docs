## Attack Tree Path: [[*] Compromise Application Using Realm Swift](./attack_tree_paths/___compromise_application_using_realm_swift.md)

*   This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. Success here means the attacker has achieved a significant breach, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, manipulating application functionality, or causing significant disruption. It is critical because it signifies a complete failure of the application's security measures related to Realm Swift.

## Attack Tree Path: [[*] Exploit Local Realm File Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/___exploit_local_realm_file_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node is critical because successful exploitation directly compromises the persistent data store of the application. This bypasses any application-level access controls and grants the attacker direct access to potentially all data managed by Realm.

## Attack Tree Path: [[*] Gain Unauthorized Access to Realm File](./attack_tree_paths/___gain_unauthorized_access_to_realm_file.md)

*   This is a fundamental critical step. Achieving unauthorized access to the Realm file is a prerequisite for many other high-risk attacks, such as data tampering and denial of service via file corruption. It bypasses the intended security perimeter around the data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[*] Impersonate a Valid Client (under Exploit Realm Sync Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/___impersonate_a_valid_client__under_exploit_realm_sync_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   This node is critical in applications using Realm Sync. Successful impersonation allows the attacker to act as a legitimate user, potentially accessing and modifying data they should not have access to. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, and compromise of other users' data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak File Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_file_permissions.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `[-] Exploit Weak File Permissions (OR)`
        *   `[T] Application stores Realm file in publicly accessible location`: If the application stores the Realm file in a location accessible to other applications or users on the device, an attacker can directly access and manipulate it without needing to compromise the application process itself.
    *   **Why High Risk:** This path is high risk due to the relatively low effort and skill required to exploit it, coupled with the high impact of gaining direct access to the Realm data. Developer oversight or misconfiguration are common reasons for this vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Encryption](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_encryption.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `[-] Exploit Lack of Encryption (OR)`
        *   `[T] Application does not utilize Realm's encryption feature`: If the Realm file is not encrypted, anyone gaining access to the file can trivially read its contents.
        *   `[T] Weak encryption key management allows key compromise`: Even with encryption enabled, if the encryption key is stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, easily accessible), an attacker can retrieve the key and decrypt the Realm file.
    *   **Why High Risk:**  The impact of successful exploitation is high (full data access), and the likelihood is medium due to potential developer oversight or poor key management practices. The effort required can range from low (if encryption is disabled) to medium (if reverse engineering is needed for key retrieval).

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Realm File Data](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_realm_file_data.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `[*] Tamper with Realm File Data [HIGH RISK]`
        *   `[-] Modify Existing Data (AND) [HIGH RISK]`
            *   `[T] Gain unauthorized access to Realm file (from above) [CRITICAL]`
    *   **Why High Risk:** Once unauthorized access to the Realm file is achieved (a critical node), modifying the data directly allows the attacker to manipulate application state, inject malicious data, or alter sensitive information. The impact is high, and the likelihood is directly tied to the successful exploitation of file access vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Manipulate Sync Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_manipulate_sync_traffic.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `[*] Intercept and Manipulate Sync Traffic [HIGH RISK]`
        *   `[-] Man-in-the-Middle Attack (AND) [HIGH RISK]`
            *   `[T] Modify data being synchronized between client and server [HIGH RISK]`: By intercepting and potentially decrypting (if encryption is weak) Realm Sync traffic, an attacker can alter data being exchanged, leading to data corruption, manipulation of application state for other users, or denial of service.
    *   **Why High Risk:**  While decrypting the protocol might be challenging, intercepting traffic is feasible on compromised networks. The impact of manipulating synchronized data is high, potentially affecting multiple users or devices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Authentication Credentials for Realm Sync](./attack_tree_paths/steal_authentication_credentials_for_realm_sync.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `[-] Steal Authentication Credentials (OR) [HIGH RISK]`
        *   `[T] Application stores sync credentials insecurely [HIGH RISK]`: If the application stores Realm Sync credentials in plain text or using weak encryption, an attacker can easily retrieve them.
        *   `[T] Exploit vulnerabilities in the application's authentication flow [HIGH RISK]`:  Vulnerabilities in how the application authenticates with the Realm Sync service can allow an attacker to bypass authentication or obtain valid credentials.
    *   **Why High Risk:**  Successful credential theft allows the attacker to impersonate a valid user (a critical node), granting them access to their data and potentially the ability to perform actions on their behalf. The likelihood is medium due to common vulnerabilities in credential storage and authentication implementations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Access Controls Implemented in Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_access_controls_implemented_in_application_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `[*] Bypass Access Controls Implemented in Application Logic [HIGH RISK]`
        *   `[-] Manipulate Application State (AND) [HIGH RISK]`
            *   `[T] Modify application state to bypass these controls [HIGH RISK]`: By understanding the application's logic for controlling access to Realm data, an attacker might be able to manipulate the application's state (e.g., flags, user roles) to bypass these controls and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Why High Risk:** This path highlights vulnerabilities in the application's own code. If access control logic is flawed, it can be exploited without needing to directly compromise the Realm file or the sync mechanism. The impact is high (unauthorized data access), and the likelihood depends on the complexity and security of the application's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Data Corruption Through Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/cause_data_corruption_through_application_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   `[*] Cause Data Corruption Through Application Logic [HIGH RISK]`
        *   `[-] Introduce Inconsistent Data (AND) [HIGH RISK]`
        *   `[-] Delete or Modify Incorrect Data (AND) [HIGH RISK]`
            *   `[T] Cause unintended deletion or modification of critical data [HIGH RISK]`: Exploiting flaws in the application's data validation, update, deletion, or modification logic can lead to data corruption, inconsistencies, or the loss of critical information.
    *   **Why High Risk:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities within the application's data handling logic. While not a direct compromise of Realm itself, it can lead to significant data integrity issues and application malfunction, with a medium likelihood due to potential flaws in complex application logic.
