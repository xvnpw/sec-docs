# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-swift

## Attack Surface: [Local Realm File Compromise](./attack_surfaces/local_realm_file_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The Realm database file is stored locally on the device's file system. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the device (e.g., through malware, physical access, or OS vulnerabilities), they can directly access and manipulate the Realm file.
    *   **How Realm-Swift Contributes:** Realm-Swift is responsible for creating and managing this local file. Its structure and format are defined by Realm.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with root access on an Android device copies the `default.realm` file containing sensitive user data. They can then analyze this file offline, potentially decrypt it if encryption is weak or absent, and extract valuable information.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data modification, data corruption, potential data loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Enable Realm File Encryption:** Utilize Realm's built-in encryption feature with a strong, securely managed encryption key. Avoid hardcoding keys.
            *   **Implement Strong Device-Level Security Recommendations:** Encourage users to use strong device passwords/biometrics and keep their OS updated.
            *   **Consider Data Obfuscation:** For highly sensitive data, consider additional layers of obfuscation within the Realm objects.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Set strong device passwords/PINs/biometrics.
            *   Keep the device operating system and applications updated.
            *   Avoid installing applications from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks During Realm Synchronization (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_during_realm_synchronization__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** When using Realm Sync, data is transmitted between the client application and the Realm Object Server. If this communication is not properly secured, an attacker could intercept and potentially manipulate this data.
    *   **How Realm-Swift Contributes:** Realm-Swift handles the client-side communication and data serialization for synchronization.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on a public Wi-Fi network intercepts the communication between the application and the Realm Object Server, potentially reading or modifying data being synchronized.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to synchronized data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all communication with the Realm Object Server uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
            *   **Implement Certificate Pinning:**  Verify the identity of the Realm Object Server to prevent MITM attacks using forged certificates.
            *   **Use Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust mechanisms for authenticating clients and authorizing access to synchronized data.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Realm Object Server (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_realm_object_server__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If the Realm Object Server itself is compromised, attackers could gain access to all synchronized data and potentially manipulate it, affecting all connected clients.
    *   **How Realm-Swift Contributes:** While Realm-Swift doesn't directly control the server, its functionality relies on the server's security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Realm Object Server's infrastructure, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data for all users of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Wide-scale data breach, data corruption, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (and Server Administrators):**
            *   **Implement Strong Server Security Practices:**  Follow industry best practices for securing servers, including regular security updates, strong access controls, and intrusion detection systems.
            *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Realm Object Server infrastructure.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to server components and administrators.
