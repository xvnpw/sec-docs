# Threat Model Analysis for realm/realm-swift

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./threats/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains physical access to the device or compromises the file system and directly reads the unencrypted Realm database file. This is a direct consequence of Realm Swift storing data in a file that, by default, is not encrypted.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or financial loss.

**Affected Component:** Local Realm file (managed by Realm Swift).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable Realm database encryption by providing an encryption key when opening the Realm using Realm Swift's `Configuration`.
* Securely manage the encryption key, avoiding hardcoding or storing it in easily accessible locations. Consider using the operating system's secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS).

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Realm Swift Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_the_realm_swift_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a known vulnerability in the Realm Swift library itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, a logic error within Realm's core functionality). This could potentially lead to crashes, data corruption, or even remote code execution within the application's context.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including application crashes, data corruption within the Realm database, or complete compromise of the application.

**Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the Realm Swift library (e.g., query engine, storage engine, synchronization components).

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Realm Swift library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the Realm team.
* Monitor the Realm GitHub repository and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities and apply updates promptly.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Sync Traffic](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_sync_traffic.md)

**Description:** If using Realm Sync, and the communication channels used by Realm Swift to synchronize data are not properly secured (e.g., due to outdated TLS configurations within the library or improper handling of SSL/TLS certificates), an attacker could intercept and potentially modify the data being synchronized. This is a threat directly related to Realm Swift's networking capabilities for synchronization.

**Impact:** Data corruption within the synchronized Realm, unauthorized data injection, or information disclosure during the synchronization process.

**Affected Component:** Realm Sync client within the Realm Swift library and its network communication modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that you are using a version of the Realm Swift library that supports and enforces strong TLS versions for secure communication with the Realm Sync service.
* Verify that the application and the Realm Swift library are correctly handling SSL/TLS certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Malicious Data](./threats/denial_of_service_through_malicious_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious data that, when stored in the Realm database through the Realm Swift API, causes the application to crash or become unresponsive when Realm Swift attempts to access or process it. This could be due to triggering a bug in Realm Swift's data handling or query processing logic.

**Impact:** Application unavailability or denial of service due to issues within the Realm Swift library's processing of specific data patterns.

**Affected Component:** Realm's query engine, object processing, and storage mechanisms within the Realm Swift library.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (while the impact is high, the direct involvement of Realm Swift might be more specific to certain data patterns)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation and sanitization for any data that originates from external sources *before* storing it in Realm using the Realm Swift API. This can prevent the introduction of data that could trigger vulnerabilities within the library.
* Consider resource limits on Realm operations to prevent excessive resource consumption if certain queries or data manipulations trigger performance issues within the library.
