## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** The attacker aims to disrupt the normal operation of the application, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This is achieved by exploiting how a dependent library interacts with `dznemptydataset`.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. This depends on the existence of a vulnerable library that misuses `dznemptydataset`.
*   **Impact:** High. A successful DoS attack can render the application unusable.
*   **Effort:** Moderate. The attacker needs to find a vulnerable library and craft inputs to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Skill Level:** Moderate. Requires understanding of NumPy, `dznemptydataset`, and how to exploit vulnerabilities in other libraries.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to High. Requires monitoring for application crashes and analyzing the call stack to determine if `dznemptydataset` and a dependent library were involved.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Triggering NumPy Errors via `__array_ufunc__` / `__array_function__` [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_triggering_numpy_errors_via____array_ufunc________array_function_____high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the primary attack vector. The attacker leverages the interaction between `dznemptydataset` and NumPy's universal functions (ufuncs) and array functions. The vulnerability lies not directly in `dznemptydataset`, but in how a *dependent* library handles the `NotImplemented` return value from `dznemptydataset`'s `__array_ufunc__` and `__array_function__` methods.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. Relies on the presence of a vulnerable dependent library.
*   **Impact:** High. Triggering a NumPy error can lead to an application crash (DoS).
*   **Effort:** Moderate. Requires finding a vulnerable library and crafting specific inputs.
*   **Skill Level:** Moderate. Requires understanding of NumPy, `dznemptydataset`, and library interaction.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to High. Requires crash analysis and potentially debugging the dependent library.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Attacker controls ufunc/function arguments (Indirectly, through a vulnerable library) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_attacker_controls_ufuncfunction_arguments__indirectly__through_a_vulnerable_library___critical_33cb2d53.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the *critical* control point. The attacker doesn't directly interact with `dznemptydataset`. Instead, they provide malicious input to a *vulnerable library* that uses `dznemptydataset`. This input is crafted to cause the vulnerable library to misuse `dznemptydataset` in a way that triggers the vulnerability. This is the essential step for the attacker to gain influence over the interaction.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. Depends on the existence and exploitability of a vulnerable library.
*   **Impact:** High. This control is necessary to trigger the subsequent steps leading to DoS.
*   **Effort:** Moderate. Requires identifying and exploiting a vulnerability in a dependent library.
*   **Skill Level:** Moderate. Requires understanding of input validation and how to exploit vulnerabilities in libraries.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to High. Requires analyzing the input handling of the dependent library and tracing the flow of data to `dznemptydataset`.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1 Vulnerable Library Misinterprets `NotImplemented` [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1_vulnerable_library_misinterprets__notimplemented___high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** The vulnerable library calls `__array_ufunc__` or `__array_function__` on an `EmptyDataset` object. `dznemptydataset` returns `NotImplemented`. The vulnerable library *incorrectly* handles this return value, leading to unexpected behavior, potentially a crash. For example, it might try to use the `NotImplemented` value as if it were a valid NumPy array, leading to a TypeError or other exception within the *vulnerable library's* code.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. This is a plausible error in library development.
*   **Impact:** High. Leads to a crash (DoS).
*   **Effort:** Moderate. Relies on finding a library with this specific mishandling.
*   **Skill Level:** Moderate. Requires understanding of how libraries should handle special return values.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to High. Requires analyzing the vulnerable library's code and how it handles `NotImplemented`.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.2 Vulnerable Library Passes Invalid Arguments to NumPy [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_2_vulnerable_library_passes_invalid_arguments_to_numpy__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** The vulnerable library, after interacting with `dznemptydataset` (and potentially receiving `NotImplemented`), proceeds to call a NumPy function.  However, because of the interaction with `dznemptydataset`, it passes *incorrect* or *invalid* arguments to the NumPy function. This leads to a crash or error *within NumPy itself*.  The root cause is still the vulnerable library's mishandling of the `EmptyDataset` object, but the crash occurs in NumPy.
*   **Likelihood:** Moderate. This is another plausible error in library development.
*   **Impact:** High. Leads to a crash (DoS).
*   **Effort:** Moderate. Relies on finding a library that makes this mistake.
*   **Skill Level:** Moderate. Requires understanding of NumPy function arguments and how libraries should interact with them.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to High. Requires analyzing the call stack to identify the incorrect arguments passed to NumPy.
