# Threat Model Analysis for dzenbot/dznemptydataset

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious serialized data (e.g., a crafted Pickle object or a manipulated JSON payload) to an application endpoint that uses `dznemptydataset` for deserialization.  If `dznemptydataset` or its dependencies have vulnerabilities in their deserialization process, the attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution.  *This threat is contingent on the application actually using `dznemptydataset` for deserialization, which isn't explicitly shown in the provided code but is a common pattern.*  This is a *direct* threat because the vulnerability would reside within `dznemptydataset`'s handling of deserialization (or its direct use of a vulnerable deserialization library).
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, remote code execution, data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Potentially any part of `dznemptydataset` involved in serialization/deserialization (if such functionality exists).  This might involve custom serialization methods or reliance on external libraries like `pickle`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if deserialization of untrusted data is used).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization:**  The best mitigation is to *never* deserialize data from untrusted sources using potentially vulnerable libraries.
        *   **Secure Deserialization:** If deserialization is absolutely necessary, use a secure serialization format (like JSON) and a well-vetted, secure deserialization library.  *Never* use `pickle` with untrusted data.
        *   **Input Validation (Pre-Deserialization):**  Before deserializing any data, rigorously validate its structure and content against a strict schema.  Reject any input that doesn't conform.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Perform deserialization within a restricted environment (e.g., a container or a separate process with limited privileges) to contain the impact of a potential vulnerability.
