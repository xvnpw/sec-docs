Okay, here's the updated attack tree focusing only on the High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes, along with a detailed breakdown of those specific attack vectors:

**Threat Model: Compromising Application Using DZNEmptyDataSet (High-Risk Focus)**

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access or control over the application or its data by leveraging vulnerabilities in the way DZNEmptyDataSet is implemented or used (specifically focusing on high-risk areas).

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   OR - **Exploit Malicious Content Injection** **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   AND - ***Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript in Empty State Text*** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Vulnerability: Application allows untrusted input to be used as empty state text.
        *   Action: Inject `<script>` tags or other HTML to execute malicious code in user's browser.
        *   Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft.
    *   AND - ***Inject Malicious URL in Empty State Image/Button*** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   Vulnerability: Application allows untrusted input to be used as image URLs or button actions.
        *   Action: Provide a URL pointing to a malicious resource (e.g., phishing page, malware download).
        *   Impact: Phishing attacks, drive-by downloads, credential harvesting.

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Attack Vectors and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Malicious Content Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

This high-risk path encompasses scenarios where an attacker can inject malicious content into the empty state displayed by the application. The primary danger lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate the data used to populate the empty state.

*   **Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript in Empty State Text [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The application directly uses untrusted input (e.g., user-provided data, data from external sources) to set the text displayed in the empty state without proper encoding or sanitization.
    *   **Attack Action:** An attacker crafts input containing malicious HTML tags, particularly `<script>` tags, or other HTML elements that can execute JavaScript code. When the application renders the empty state, this injected code is executed within the user's browser.
    *   **Potential Impact:** This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can:
        *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
        *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
        *   Display fake login forms to steal credentials.
        *   Inject further malicious content into the page.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

*   **Inject Malicious URL in Empty State Image/Button [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The application allows untrusted input to define the source URL for images displayed in the empty state or the target URL for buttons within the empty state.
    *   **Attack Action:** An attacker provides a malicious URL as the image source or button target. This URL could point to:
        *   A phishing website designed to steal credentials.
        *   A website hosting malware that is automatically downloaded when the image is loaded or the button is clicked (drive-by download).
        *   A website that exploits browser vulnerabilities.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   **Phishing Attacks:** Users might be tricked into entering their credentials on a fake login page that looks legitimate.
        *   **Malware Infection:** Users' devices could be infected with malware without their knowledge.
        *   **Compromise of User Accounts:** Stolen credentials can be used to access user accounts and sensitive data.

These two critical nodes within the "Exploit Malicious Content Injection" path represent the most immediate and significant threats related to the use of DZNEmptyDataSet. Addressing the underlying vulnerabilities that allow for unsanitized input in these contexts is paramount for securing the application.
