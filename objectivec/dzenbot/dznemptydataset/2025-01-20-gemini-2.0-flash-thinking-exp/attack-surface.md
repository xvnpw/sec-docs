# Attack Surface Analysis for dzenbot/dznemptydataset

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversallocal_file_inclusion__lfi_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths provided by the dataset to access files or directories outside the intended scope on the server's filesystem.
    * **How dznemptydataset Contributes:** The library provides a list of file paths. If the application uses these paths directly to access files without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable. The dataset acts as the source of potentially malicious paths.
    * **Example:** The application iterates through `dataset.file_paths` and uses each path in a file reading function: `with open(filepath, 'r') as f: ...`. An attacker could influence the application to use a modified dataset (if locally stored) or if the application logic allows for path manipulation based on the dataset, leading to accessing files like `/etc/passwd`.
    * **Impact:**  Reading sensitive configuration files, source code, or other critical data; potential for remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation:**  Implement robust validation on any file paths derived from the dataset before using them to access files. Use allow-lists of permitted directories or file extensions.
        * **Path Canonicalization:**  Use functions to resolve symbolic links and normalize paths to prevent traversal attempts (e.g., `os.path.realpath` in Python).
        * **Sandboxing/Chroot:**  Restrict the application's access to a specific directory, preventing it from accessing files outside that boundary.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to access files.

## Attack Surface: [Data Poisoning (Dataset Modification)](./attack_surfaces/data_poisoning__dataset_modification_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker modifies the dataset (if it's stored locally and accessible) to inject malicious file paths or other data, leading to unexpected application behavior.
    * **How dznemptydataset Contributes:** If the application relies on a locally stored copy of the dataset (e.g., a downloaded JSON file), and this file is writable by an attacker (due to insecure permissions or other vulnerabilities), the attacker can alter the `file_paths` array.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies the local `dataset.json` file to include paths like `../../malicious_script.sh` or paths pointing to files they control. When the application uses this modified dataset, it might attempt to execute or process these malicious files.
    * **Impact:**  Code execution, data corruption, denial of service, or other application-specific vulnerabilities depending on how the application uses the dataset.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Storage Permissions:** Ensure the dataset file (if stored locally) has appropriate permissions, preventing unauthorized modification.
        * **Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the dataset before use (e.g., checksums, digital signatures).
        * **Read-Only Access:** If possible, configure the application to access the dataset in read-only mode.
        * **Centralized and Trusted Source:** If feasible, fetch the dataset from a trusted and controlled source rather than relying on a local copy.
