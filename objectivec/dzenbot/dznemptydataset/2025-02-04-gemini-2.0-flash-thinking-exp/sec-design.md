# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - The primary goal of the dznemptydataset project is to provide developers with a readily available, empty dataset for use in software development and testing.
 - This accelerates development cycles by removing the need for developers to create their own placeholder datasets.
 - It ensures consistency across development environments by providing a standardized empty dataset.
 - The project aims to be lightweight, easily accessible, and require minimal maintenance.

- Business Risks:
 - Availability risk: If the repository becomes unavailable, it could temporarily disrupt development workflows that depend on it.
 - Data integrity risk: Although intended to be empty, there's a minor risk of accidental inclusion of sensitive or incorrect data, which could lead to unexpected behavior in dependent systems during testing.
 - Security risk: If the repository is compromised, it could be used to distribute malicious datasets, although the impact is likely low given the nature of empty datasets.
 - Dependency risk: Over-reliance on this specific dataset could create vendor lock-in or impact if the project is discontinued.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Access control - GitHub repository access is controlled by GitHub's authentication and authorization mechanisms. Implemented in: GitHub platform.
 - security control: Version control - Git version control system tracks changes and provides history. Implemented in: Git and GitHub platform.
 - accepted risk: Public accessibility - The repository is publicly accessible on GitHub, which is an accepted risk to maximize ease of use and accessibility for developers.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Dependency scanning - Although unlikely for this project, dependency scanning could be implemented to ensure no malicious dependencies are introduced if the project evolves to include build tools or scripts.
 - security control: Content scanning - Periodically scan the repository content to ensure it remains empty and does not inadvertently contain sensitive data.
 - security control: Branch protection - Implement branch protection on the main branch to prevent accidental direct commits and enforce code review for any changes.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Access to the repository for read operations is public and anonymous.
  - Requirement: Write access (if needed for maintainers) should be authenticated via GitHub accounts.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Public users are authorized for read-only access (clone, pull).
  - Requirement: Maintainers (if any) should be authorized for write access (push, merge).
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Not directly applicable as the project primarily serves static datasets. If the project evolves to include any form of input processing, input validation will be required to prevent injection attacks.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Not applicable for this project as it does not handle sensitive data or require confidentiality or integrity of data in transit or at rest beyond standard Git and GitHub mechanisms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - The critical business process supported by this project is software development and testing efficiency. Any disruption or compromise could slow down development cycles.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Data to protect: The empty dataset files themselves.
 - Data Sensitivity: Low. The datasets are intentionally empty and should not contain any sensitive information. However, maintaining integrity (ensuring they remain empty) is important to avoid unexpected issues in dependent systems. Accidental inclusion of real data would increase sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What are the specific dataset formats required by the users? (Current repository includes JSON, CSV, XML). Should more formats be added?
 - Is there a need for different "sizes" of empty datasets? (e.g., small, medium, large empty datasets).
 - Is there any plan to evolve this project beyond just providing static empty datasets? (e.g., generating dynamic placeholder data).
 - Who is responsible for maintaining the repository and ensuring the datasets remain empty and available?
 - Are there any specific performance requirements for accessing the datasets?

- Assumptions:
 - Assumption: The primary use case is for development and testing purposes, not for production systems.
 - Assumption: The datasets are intended to be genuinely empty or contain only placeholder data with no real or sensitive information.
 - Assumption: Ease of access and minimal maintenance are higher priorities than stringent security measures, given the nature of the project.
 - Assumption: The target audience is software developers who are familiar with Git and GitHub.
 - Assumption: The current deployment method of direct access from GitHub is sufficient and cost-effective.
