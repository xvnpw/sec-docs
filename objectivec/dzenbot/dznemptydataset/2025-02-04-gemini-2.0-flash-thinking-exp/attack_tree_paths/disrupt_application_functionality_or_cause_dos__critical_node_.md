**4.1. Understanding the Attack Path**

The "Disrupt Application Functionality or Cause DoS" attack path represents a broad category of attacks aimed at making the application unusable or significantly degrading its performance for legitimate users.  The provided characteristics highlight key aspects:

*   **Critical Node:**  This is a critical node in the attack tree, indicating a high-level, impactful objective. Success here can severely impact business operations.
*   **Likelihood: Medium to High:**  This suggests that achieving this objective is reasonably feasible for attackers, especially if adequate mitigations are not in place. The likelihood depends heavily on the application's security posture and the specific attack vector chosen.
*   **Impact: High:**  The impact is significant, potentially leading to application outages, business disruption, financial losses, and reputational damage.
*   **Effort: Low to Medium:**  The effort required by the attacker is relatively low to medium, meaning that even less sophisticated attackers can potentially launch successful attacks, especially using readily available tools and techniques.
