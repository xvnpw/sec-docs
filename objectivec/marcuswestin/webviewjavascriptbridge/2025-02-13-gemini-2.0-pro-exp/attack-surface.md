# Attack Surface Analysis for marcuswestin/webviewjavascriptbridge

## Attack Surface: [1. Message Interception/Modification (Man-in-the-Middle on the Bridge)](./attack_surfaces/1__message_interceptionmodification__man-in-the-middle_on_the_bridge_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers on a compromised device intercept or alter messages exchanged between the native application and the webview via the bridge.
*   **How webviewjavascriptbridge Contributes:** The bridge *is* the communication channel, making this attack possible.  It's distinct from webview HTTPS security.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a message containing a user's session token sent from the native app to the webview, allowing them to impersonate the user.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of user accounts, data theft, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Cryptographic Message Integrity:** Implement message signing (e.g., SHA-256 with a securely stored key). Verify signatures on *both* sides before processing.
    *   **Encryption of Bridge Messages:** Encrypt the entire message payload (e.g., AES with a securely managed key).
    *   **Root/Jailbreak Detection:** Detect compromised devices and limit/disable functionality.
    *   **Code Obfuscation & Anti-Tampering:** Hinder reverse engineering of the bridge communication.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unauthorized Native Function Calls](./attack_surfaces/2__unauthorized_native_function_calls.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious JavaScript that calls native functions exposed by the bridge with unexpected or malicious parameters.
*   **How webviewjavascriptbridge Contributes:** The bridge's *core purpose* is to expose native functions to JavaScript, creating this direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects JavaScript that calls a native function designed to delete user data, passing a wildcard to delete *all* data.
*   **Impact:**  Data loss, denial of service, privilege escalation, execution of arbitrary native code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate *all* input from JavaScript in *every* exposed native function. Use whitelisting.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Expose only the absolute minimum necessary native functions.
    *   **Contextual Authorization:** Verify the calling context (e.g., origin URL) before execution.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency of native function calls.

## Attack Surface: [3. JavaScript Hijacking of Bridge Callbacks](./attack_surfaces/3__javascript_hijacking_of_bridge_callbacks.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject JavaScript that overwrites or intercepts callbacks used by the bridge, stealing data or manipulating behavior.
*   **How webviewjavascriptbridge Contributes:** The bridge *relies* on JavaScript callbacks for asynchronous communication, making them a direct target.
*   **Example:** An attacker overwrites a callback receiving sensitive user data, redirecting it to their server.
*   **Impact:**  Data theft, manipulation of application logic, potential for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Callback Isolation:** Use IIFEs or closures to isolate callback handling, preventing interference.
    *   **Minimize Callback Data:** Return only essential data in callbacks.
    *   **Data Sanitization (on Native Side):** Sanitize data *before* passing it to the JavaScript callback.

## Attack Surface: [4. Reflection-Based Attacks](./attack_surfaces/4__reflection-based_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the bridge handles message routing and function dispatch, potentially calling unintended native functions.
*   **How webviewjavascriptbridge Contributes:** The bridge's *internal implementation* of message handling and function dispatch can introduce these vulnerabilities if not designed securely.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a message with a manipulated function name that, due to a flaw in the bridge's logic, calls a privileged function not intended for exposure.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary native code, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid String-Based Dispatch:** Use secure dispatch (function pointers, static interfaces) instead of string-based names.
    *   **Strict Type Checking:** Enforce rigorous type checking on all parameters and function identifiers.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the bridge implementation for reflection vulnerabilities.
