# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.2 Trick Native Side into Sending Sensitive Data

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path "2.2 Trick Native Side into Sending Sensitive Data" within the context of a mobile application utilizing the `webviewjavascriptbridge` library (https://github.com/marcuswestin/webviewjavascriptbridge).  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their likelihood and impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden the application against this class of attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the interaction between the WebView and the native code facilitated by `webviewjavascriptbridge`.  We will consider:

*   **The `webviewjavascriptbridge` mechanism itself:**  How messages are formatted, sent, and received.  We'll assume the attacker has already achieved code execution within the WebView (node 2.2.1, "Compromise WebView Content").  This is a *critical* prerequisite; without it, the rest of this attack path is impossible.
*   **Native-side message handlers:**  The code on the native side (iOS or Android) that receives and processes messages from the WebView.  This is where the core vulnerability lies.
*   **Types of sensitive data potentially exposed:**  We'll consider various categories of sensitive data that might be accessible to the native code and thus vulnerable to exfiltration.
*   **Input validation and sanitization:**  The presence (or absence) and effectiveness of input validation on the native side.
*   **Message format and semantics:** How the attacker might craft malicious messages to exploit vulnerabilities in the native code.

We will *not* cover:

*   **The initial compromise of the WebView (2.2.1):**  This is assumed to have already occurred (e.g., via XSS).  This analysis focuses solely on exploiting the bridge *after* the WebView is compromised.
*   **Generic mobile application security best practices:**  While relevant, we'll focus specifically on the bridge-related vulnerabilities.
*   **Other attack tree paths:**  We are strictly limiting our scope to path 2.2.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Since we don't have the specific application code, we'll analyze hypothetical (but realistic) examples of native-side message handlers and `webviewjavascriptbridge` usage.  We'll draw on common patterns and known vulnerabilities.
2.  **Threat Modeling:**  We'll systematically identify potential threats based on the attack tree path, considering attacker capabilities and motivations.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We'll identify specific weaknesses in the hypothetical code and bridge usage that could be exploited.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  For each identified vulnerability, we'll propose concrete mitigation strategies.
5.  **Documentation:**  The findings and recommendations will be documented in this report.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.2

**2.2 Trick Native Side into Sending Sensitive Data [HR]**

This is the root of the specific attack path we're analyzing.  The attacker's goal is to exfiltrate sensitive data from the native side of the application by exploiting the `webviewjavascriptbridge`.

**2.2.1 Compromise WebView Content (XSS, etc.):** (Assumed prerequisite, outside the scope)

This is a *critical* assumption.  We are operating under the premise that the attacker has already gained the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the WebView.  This could be achieved through various means, such as:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If the WebView loads content from a web server, and that server is vulnerable to XSS, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Loading a malicious HTML file:**  If the WebView loads local HTML files, the attacker might find a way to inject a malicious file.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:**  If the WebView loads content over an insecure connection (or a compromised HTTPS connection), the attacker could inject malicious JavaScript.

Without this prerequisite, the attacker cannot send messages through the bridge.

**2.2.2 Send Malicious Message Requesting Sensitive Data [CN]**

This is the core of the attack.  The attacker, having control over the JavaScript execution in the WebView, uses the `webviewjavascriptbridge` to send a crafted message to the native side.  The goal is to trick the native code into returning sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

**2.2.2.1 Bypass Input Validation (if any) [HR]**

This is a *high-risk* vulnerability.  The native-side message handler likely expects certain parameters in the message.  If the handler doesn't properly validate these parameters, the attacker can inject malicious values.

*   **Example (Hypothetical - iOS Swift):**

    ```swift
    // Vulnerable Native Code (Swift)
    bridge.registerHandler("getUserData") { (data, responseCallback) in
        guard let userId = data?["userId"] as? String else {
            responseCallback?(["error": "Invalid request"])
            return
        }

        // Directly using userId without validation!
        let userData = database.getUserData(for: userId)
        responseCallback?(userData)
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `userId` is taken directly from the message data without any validation.  An attacker could send:

    ```javascript
    // Malicious JavaScript in WebView
    WebViewJavascriptBridge.callHandler('getUserData', { userId: "'; DROP TABLE Users; --" }, function(response) {
        console.log('Received data:', response);
    });
    ```

    This is a classic SQL injection attack.  If the `database.getUserData` function uses string concatenation to build the SQL query, the attacker could potentially delete the entire `Users` table.  Even if it's not a SQL database, the attacker might be able to access data for *any* user by providing a different `userId`.

*   **Mitigation:**

    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Implement rigorous input validation on *all* parameters received from the WebView.  This includes:
        *   **Type checking:** Ensure the data is of the expected type (String, Int, etc.).
        *   **Length restrictions:**  Limit the length of strings to prevent buffer overflows or excessively long inputs.
        *   **Whitelist validation:**  If possible, only allow specific, known-good values.  For example, if `userId` is supposed to be a UUID, validate it against a UUID regex.
        *   **Sanitization:**  Escape or remove any potentially dangerous characters (e.g., SQL injection characters, HTML tags).  Use parameterized queries for database interactions.
        *   **Context-aware validation:** The validation rules should be specific to the expected use of the data.

    *   **Parameterized Queries (for databases):**  *Never* use string concatenation to build SQL queries.  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.

    *   **Input validation library:** Use well-tested input validation libraries.

**2.2.2.2 Masquerade as Legitimate Request:**

This attack vector relies on the attacker understanding the expected message format and semantics of the native-side handlers.  The attacker crafts a message that *looks* legitimate but contains subtle modifications to extract unintended data.

*   **Example (Hypothetical - Android Java):**

    ```java
    // Vulnerable Native Code (Java)
    bridge.registerHandler("getProductDetails", (data, responseCallback) -> {
        try {
            JSONObject jsonData = new JSONObject(data);
            String productId = jsonData.getString("productId");
            // Assume getProductDetails returns a JSONObject with "name" and "price"
            JSONObject productDetails = database.getProductDetails(productId);

            //VULNERABILITY: The native code returns ALL product details
            responseCallback.callback(productDetails.toString());

        } catch (JSONException e) {
            responseCallback.callback("{\"error\": \"Invalid request\"}");
        }
    });
    ```
    ```javascript
    //Malicious Javascript in WebView
    WebViewJavascriptBridge.callHandler('getProductDetails', { productId: "123" }, function(response) {
            console.log('Received data:', response);
            //Potentially sensitive data is leaked
    });
    ```

    Suppose `getProductDetails` in the database returns *more* than just the name and price.  It might also return internal fields like `costPrice`, `supplierId`, or `profitMargin`.  The native code, intending to return only a subset of the data, inadvertently returns *all* fields because it passes the entire `productDetails` object to the `responseCallback`.

*   **Mitigation:**

    *   **Data Minimization:**  The native code should *explicitly* select only the necessary data to return to the WebView.  Create a new object (or a data transfer object - DTO) containing only the allowed fields.

        ```java
        // Mitigated Native Code (Java)
        bridge.registerHandler("getProductDetails", (data, responseCallback) -> {
            try {
                JSONObject jsonData = new JSONObject(data);
                String productId = jsonData.getString("productId");
                JSONObject productDetails = database.getProductDetails(productId);

                // Create a DTO with only the allowed fields
                JSONObject responseData = new JSONObject();
                responseData.put("name", productDetails.getString("name"));
                responseData.put("price", productDetails.getDouble("price"));

                responseCallback.callback(responseData.toString());

            } catch (JSONException e) {
                responseCallback.callback("{\"error\": \"Invalid request\"}");
            }
        });
        ```

    *   **Strict API Contracts:**  Define clear and strict contracts between the WebView and the native code.  Document exactly what data is expected in requests and what data will be returned in responses.

    *   **Code Reviews:**  Thorough code reviews are crucial to catch these types of subtle vulnerabilities.  Reviewers should specifically look for cases where the native code might be returning more data than intended.

    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** The webview should only have access to the minimum necessary data and functionality.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The attack path "2.2 Trick Native Side into Sending Sensitive Data" presents a significant risk to applications using `webviewjavascriptbridge`. The core vulnerability lies in the native-side message handlers, which may be susceptible to input validation bypasses and unintended data exposure.

**Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Assume the WebView is Compromised:**  Design the native-side code with the assumption that the attacker *will* be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the WebView.
2.  **Implement Rigorous Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate *all* data received from the WebView, using type checking, length restrictions, whitelist validation, and sanitization.
3.  **Use Parameterized Queries:**  Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions.
4.  **Minimize Data Exposure:**  The native code should *explicitly* select only the necessary data to return to the WebView.  Create data transfer objects (DTOs) to control the data flow.
5.  **Define Strict API Contracts:**  Clearly document the expected message formats and data exchange between the WebView and the native code.
6.  **Conduct Regular Code Reviews:**  Perform thorough code reviews, focusing on the `webviewjavascriptbridge` interactions and data handling.
7.  **Security Audits:** Consider engaging a third-party security firm to conduct a penetration test and security audit of the application, specifically targeting the bridge functionality.
8. **Consider Alternatives:** If the security requirements are very high, consider if `webviewjavascriptbridge` is the right tool. Native modules or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms might offer better security controls, although they may be more complex to implement.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of sensitive data exfiltration through the `webviewjavascriptbridge`. The most important principle is to treat the WebView as an untrusted environment and to design the native code defensively.
