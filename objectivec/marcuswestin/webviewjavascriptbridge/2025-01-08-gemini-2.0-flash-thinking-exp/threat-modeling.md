# Threat Model Analysis for marcuswestin/webviewjavascriptbridge

## Threat: [JavaScript-to-Native Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/javascript-to-native_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor injects JavaScript code into the WebView. This JavaScript crafts a specific message that, when processed by the native side *through the bridge*, leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the device with the application's privileges. The attacker leverages the bridge's communication mechanism to trigger this.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the device. The attacker could steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** `send(handlerName, data, responseCallback)` function in JavaScript, native message handling logic (specifically the handlers registered *via the bridge*).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Strict Input Validation on Native Side:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received from the JavaScript side *through the bridge* before processing it.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the native code invoked *by the bridge* has the minimum necessary permissions.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Avoid using `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution methods on the native side based on JavaScript input received *through the bridge*.
- **Code Reviews:** Regularly review the native code that handles bridge messages for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Consider using a more structured communication format:** Instead of relying on string parsing, use a more structured format like JSON and validate its schema on the native side when receiving messages *via the bridge*.

## Threat: [Native-to-JavaScript Code Injection (WebView XSS)](./threats/native-to-javascript_code_injection__webview_xss_.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in the native code allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the WebView *through the bridge's response mechanism*. The attacker exploits a lack of proper encoding or escaping of data sent from the native side to the JavaScript side *via the bridge*.

**Impact:** The injected JavaScript can execute in the context of the WebView, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, access local storage, manipulate the DOM, and perform actions on behalf of the user within the WebView.

**Affected Component:** Native code sending responses back to JavaScript *via the bridge* (e.g., the response callback mechanism), JavaScript code receiving and rendering data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Proper Output Encoding on Native Side:** Ensure all data sent from the native side to the JavaScript side *through the bridge* is properly encoded (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP for the WebView to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed and restrict other potentially dangerous behaviors. This helps mitigate the impact of successful injection.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Review the native code that sends data to the WebView *via the bridge* for potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [JavaScript-to-Native Data Exfiltration](./threats/javascript-to-native_data_exfiltration.md)

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript within the WebView crafts messages *through the bridge* to the native side, tricking it into accessing and sending back sensitive data that the JavaScript would not normally have access to. The attacker exploits the bridge to facilitate this communication.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, application secrets, or other confidential information.

**Affected Component:** `send(handlerName, data, responseCallback)` function in JavaScript, native message handling logic, specifically handlers that access sensitive data *when invoked through the bridge*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Authorization Checks on Native Side:** Implement robust authorization checks on the native side before accessing or returning sensitive data in response to bridge messages.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the amount of sensitive data accessible by the native code that interacts *with the bridge*.
- **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize any sensitive data before sending it back to the JavaScript side *through the bridge*, if absolutely necessary. Consider if the JavaScript truly needs this data.

## Threat: [Function Call Injection via JavaScript-to-Native Bridge](./threats/function_call_injection_via_javascript-to-native_bridge.md)

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript manipulates the `handlerName` parameter in the `send()` function *of the bridge* to invoke unintended native functions. This directly exploits the bridge's mechanism for routing messages.

**Impact:** Execution of unintended native functions, potentially leading to data access, code execution, or denial of service, depending on the functionality of the invoked function.

**Affected Component:** `send(handlerName, data, responseCallback)` function in JavaScript, native message routing and handler lookup mechanism *within the bridge's implementation or the application's handler registration*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Strict Whitelisting of Handler Names:** On the native side, only allow invocation of explicitly whitelisted handler names *registered with the bridge*.
- **Input Validation of Handler Names:** Validate the format and content of the `handlerName` parameter received *through the bridge*.
- **Avoid Dynamic Handler Lookup:** If possible, avoid dynamically looking up handlers based on strings provided by JavaScript *through the bridge*. Use a more controlled mapping mechanism.
