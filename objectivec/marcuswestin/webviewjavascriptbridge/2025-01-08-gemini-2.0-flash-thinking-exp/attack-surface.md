# Attack Surface Analysis for marcuswestin/webviewjavascriptbridge

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Injection via Native `callHandler`](./attack_surfaces/javascript_injection_via_native__callhandler_.md)

*   **Description:** Native code constructs the arguments passed to the WebView's JavaScript `callHandler` function using unsanitized or improperly escaped data from external sources. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed within the WebView's context.
    *   **How `webviewjavascriptbridge` Contributes:** The `callHandler` mechanism provided by the bridge is the direct channel through which native code can execute JavaScript in the WebView. If the data passed through this channel is not handled securely, it becomes an injection point.
    *   **Example:** Native code fetches user input from a form and uses it directly in `webView.evaluateJavascript("alert('" + userInput + "');", null);` without escaping. If `userInput` is `'); malicious_code(); //`, it will execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, unauthorized actions within the WebView, and potentially access to native functionalities if the WebView has further bridges or capabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data and actions within the WebView).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Always sanitize or properly escape data originating from external sources before using it in `callHandler`.
            *   Avoid constructing JavaScript code dynamically using string concatenation. Prefer passing data as arguments to predefined JavaScript functions.
            *   Use templating engines with auto-escaping features if constructing dynamic content.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Native Function Calls from WebView](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_native_function_calls_from_webview.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious actor controlling the content within the WebView can call any registered native handler using the bridge's `callHandler` function. If the native side doesn't implement proper authorization or input validation, an attacker can invoke sensitive native functionality.
    *   **How `webviewjavascriptbridge` Contributes:** The core functionality of the bridge is to allow JavaScript in the WebView to invoke native code via registered handlers. This direct invocation capability is the source of this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A malicious website loaded in the WebView calls a native handler named `processPayment` with crafted parameters to initiate a fraudulent transaction.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of unauthorized native code, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, access to sensitive device resources, or other malicious actions depending on the exposed native functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive native functionalities are exposed without proper protection).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict authorization checks on the native side before executing any actions within a handler. Verify the origin or context of the call if possible.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege: only expose necessary native functionalities through the bridge.
            *   Consider using a whitelisting approach for allowed callers or origins if applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Input Parameter Manipulation in Native Handlers](./attack_surfaces/input_parameter_manipulation_in_native_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** The arguments passed from the WebView to native handlers via `callHandler` can be manipulated by a malicious actor in the WebView. If the native code doesn't thoroughly validate and sanitize these inputs, it can be vulnerable to various injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    *   **How `webviewjavascriptbridge` Contributes:** The bridge acts as the conduit for passing data from the WebView to the native side. The lack of inherent validation within the bridge itself makes it susceptible to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A native handler expects an integer ID. A malicious website sends a string like `"1; DROP TABLE users;"` hoping to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability if the native code uses this input in a database query without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, etc.), leading to data breaches, data manipulation, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the native side for all parameters received from the WebView.
            *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
            *   Avoid constructing system commands directly from user-provided input.
