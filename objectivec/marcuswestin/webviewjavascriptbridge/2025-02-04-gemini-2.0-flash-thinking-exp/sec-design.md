# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Priority: Efficient development of hybrid mobile applications.
 - Goal: Simplify communication between JavaScript code in webviews and native mobile application code.
 - Goal: Reduce development time and complexity for features requiring webview and native code interaction.
 - Goal: Enable code reuse across web and native layers in hybrid applications.

- Business Risks:
 - Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the bridge could be exploited to compromise the application and user data.
 - Business Risk:  Poor performance of the bridge could negatively impact the user experience of hybrid applications.
 - Business Risk:  Lack of maintainability or updates to the bridge could lead to compatibility issues and increased development costs in the long term.
 - Business Risk:  Adoption risk if the library is not well-documented or easy to use, hindering developer adoption and project success.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
 - security control: Open-source license (MIT License), allowing community review and contributions. (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)
 - accepted risk: No formal security audit has been performed on the library.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying webview and JavaScript execution environment.
 - accepted risk: Potential for misuse if not implemented correctly by developers using the library.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for developers using the library.
 - security control: Consider a formal security audit by a third-party security firm.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - requirement: The library itself does not handle user authentication. Authentication should be implemented at the application level, both in the native and webview contexts.
  - requirement: Secure communication channels should be used for transmitting any authentication tokens or credentials between webview and native code if necessary (though ideally, avoid passing sensitive credentials through the bridge).
 - Authorization:
  - requirement: The library should not bypass any authorization mechanisms implemented in the native application or webview.
  - requirement: Access control decisions should be made in the appropriate layer (native or webview) based on the application's security policy, not solely within the bridge.
 - Input Validation:
  - requirement: All data passed through the bridge from JavaScript to native code and vice versa must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., JavaScript injection, SQL injection if native code interacts with databases).
  - requirement: Implement input sanitization and encoding to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) risks if the bridge handles user-provided data.
 - Cryptography:
  - requirement: If sensitive data is transmitted through the bridge, it should be encrypted using appropriate cryptographic methods.
  - requirement: Utilize platform-provided secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on iOS) for storing any cryptographic keys or sensitive data used by the bridge or the application.
  - requirement: Ensure proper key management practices are followed if cryptography is implemented.
