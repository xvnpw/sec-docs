# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for marcuswestin/webviewjavascriptbridge

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Control Exposed Native Functions](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_control_exposed_native_functions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory Native Functions:**  Create a comprehensive list of all native functions that are *potentially* exposable through the `webviewjavascriptbridge`.
    2.  **Necessity Assessment:** For each function, critically evaluate if it is *absolutely necessary* to expose it to the WebView.
    3.  **Whitelist Implementation:** Implement a strict whitelist on the native side, explicitly defining allowed native functions for JavaScript calls.
    4.  **Secure Registration Mechanism:** Ensure the function registration with the bridge is secure and not bypassable.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Regularly review and update the whitelist, removing unnecessary functions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Native Function Calls (High Severity):** Malicious JavaScript could call unintended, sensitive native functions, leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Attackers could exploit exposed functions to gain elevated privileges.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Native Function Calls (High Risk Reduction):** Significantly reduces attack vectors by limiting exposed functions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Risk Reduction):** Makes privilege escalation attacks much harder.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Whitelist partially implemented in `NativeBridgeManager.java` (Android) and `NativeBridge.swift` (iOS).
    *   Currently, only functions related to user profile retrieval (`getUserProfile`) and logging (`sendAppLog`) are whitelisted.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Whitelist not formally documented or fully enforced.
    *   No automated checks for whitelist enforcement.
    *   No scheduled process for whitelist review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization on Native Side](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_on_native_side.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Pinpoint all native code locations processing data from `webviewjavascriptbridge`.
    2.  **Define Validation Rules:** Define strict validation rules for each input point based on expected data type, format, and values.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic:** Implement robust input validation in native code *before* processing data from JavaScript.
    4.  **Sanitize Data:** Sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., encoding, escaping, type conversion).
    5.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for invalid input, rejecting it gracefully and logging errors.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Data from WebView could inject malicious code into native operations (SQL, command injection, etc.).
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Invalid data from WebView could cause crashes or data corruption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Risk Reduction):** Crucial for preventing injection attacks, reducing high-severity risks.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Risk Reduction):** Improves data integrity and application stability.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic input validation for `getUserProfile` (data type checks).
    *   Partial sanitization for logging messages in `sendAppLog`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive input validation missing for many native functions.
    *   Sanitization not consistently applied across all functions.
    *   No centralized validation/sanitization library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update WebviewJavascriptBridge Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_webviewjavascriptbridge_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Integrate `webviewjavascriptbridge` into project dependency management.
    2.  **Monitoring for Updates:** Regularly check for library updates on GitHub or dependency management tools.
    3.  **Update and Test:** Update the library when updates are available and thoroughly test the application.
    4.  **Security Advisory Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories for `webviewjavascriptbridge` and its dependencies.
    5.  **Patching Process:** Establish a process for quickly patching the library for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in WebviewJavascriptBridge Library (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in the library itself could directly compromise application security.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Indirectly mitigates vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in WebviewJavascriptBridge Library (High Risk Reduction):** Patches known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing exploitation risk.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium Risk Reduction):** Indirectly improves security by updating dependencies.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `webviewjavascriptbridge` is in project dependency management (Gradle/Swift Package Manager).
    *   Developers are generally aware of dependency update needs.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No automated update checks or notifications.
    *   No formal process for regular updates.
    *   No established process for monitoring security advisories for `webviewjavascriptbridge`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authentication and Authorization for Sensitive Native Functions (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authentication_and_authorization_for_sensitive_native_functions__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Functions:** Determine which exposed native functions are sensitive.
    2.  **Authentication Mechanism Design:** Design an authentication method to verify JavaScript calls to sensitive functions (API keys, tokens, session management, signatures).
    3.  **Authorization Checks:** Implement native-side authorization checks to verify if authenticated JavaScript is authorized to call the function.
    4.  **Secure Key Management (If using API Keys/Tokens):** Securely manage API keys or tokens, avoiding hardcoding in JavaScript.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Functions (High Severity):** Any JavaScript could call sensitive functions without control.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Unauthorized access to sensitive functions could lead to data breaches.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Functions (High Risk Reduction):** Prevents unauthorized JavaScript from calling sensitive functions.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Risk Reduction):** Protects sensitive data by controlling access to functions.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No authentication or authorization mechanisms are implemented.
    *   All whitelisted functions are accessible without authentication.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authentication mechanism needs to be designed and implemented.
    *   Authorization checks need to be implemented on the native side.
    *   Secure key management strategy is needed if using API keys/tokens.
