#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated and Impact

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in WebviewJavascriptBridge Library (High Severity):** This mitigation strategy directly and effectively addresses the risk of vulnerabilities within the `webviewjavascriptbridge` library itself. By regularly updating, known vulnerabilities are patched, significantly reducing the attack surface and potential for exploitation.  **Severity remains High if updates are not applied, but the mitigation aims to reduce the *likelihood* of exploitation by addressing known vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  While not directly focused on dependencies of `webviewjavascriptbridge`, updating the library *may* indirectly include updates to its dependencies. This offers a secondary benefit of mitigating vulnerabilities in those dependencies. However, this is not guaranteed, and a more comprehensive approach to dependency vulnerability management is recommended (separate mitigation strategy). **Severity is Medium as dependency vulnerabilities are less directly impactful than vulnerabilities in the core library itself, but still pose a significant risk.**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in WebviewJavascriptBridge Library (High Risk Reduction):**  This mitigation strategy provides a **High Risk Reduction** for vulnerabilities in the `webviewjavascriptbridge` library.  Applying updates and patches directly eliminates known vulnerabilities, significantly decreasing the probability and impact of exploitation.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium Risk Reduction):**  The risk reduction for dependency vulnerabilities is **Medium**. While updates *may* include dependency updates, it's not a primary focus and doesn't guarantee comprehensive dependency vulnerability management.  The risk reduction is less direct and potentially less complete compared to the primary library vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Positive:**  Having `webviewjavascriptbridge` in dependency management is a good starting point and indicates awareness of dependency management principles.  Developer awareness of update needs is also a positive sign, suggesting a culture of considering updates.
    *   **Limitations:**  "Generally aware" is not sufficient for consistent and reliable security.  Manual awareness is prone to errors and omissions.

*   **Missing Implementation (Critical Gaps):**
    *   **Critical:** The lack of automated update checks and notifications is a significant weakness.  This relies entirely on manual effort and increases the risk of missing important updates, especially security patches.
    *   **Critical:**  The absence of a formal process for regular updates means updates are likely ad-hoc and inconsistent, leading to potential delays in applying security patches.
    *   **Critical:**  No established process for monitoring security advisories is a major security gap.  Without proactive monitoring, the team will be reactive to vulnerability disclosures, increasing the window of vulnerability exposure.
