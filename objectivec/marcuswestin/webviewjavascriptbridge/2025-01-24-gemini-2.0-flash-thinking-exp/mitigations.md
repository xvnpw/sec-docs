## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization for Bridge Messages](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_bridge_messages.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all native functions** that are exposed to JavaScript through `webviewjavascriptbridge`. These are the entry points for data coming from the WebView.
    2.  **For each exposed function, define the expected data type, format, and allowed values** for every parameter it receives *via the bridge*. Document these expectations clearly, specifically for bridge communication.
    3.  **Implement validation logic in the native code** *within each bridge handler function*. This validation should specifically target data received from JavaScript through the bridge and check:
        *   **Data Type:** Ensure the received data is of the expected type (e.g., string, number, boolean, object) as defined for the bridge message structure.
        *   **Format:** Verify the data conforms to the expected format (e.g., email address, URL, date format, specific string patterns using regular expressions) relevant to the bridge message content.
        *   **Allowed Values:** Check if the data falls within the allowed range or is part of an allowed set of values (use allow-lists instead of deny-lists) as defined for valid bridge messages.
        *   **Length:** Validate the length of strings or arrays received through the bridge to prevent buffer overflows or unexpected behavior in native handlers.
    4.  **If validation fails for any bridge message parameter, immediately reject the message within the bridge handler.** Do not proceed with processing the invalid data in the native function.
    5.  **Implement robust error handling** for bridge message validation failures. Log the error details (without exposing sensitive information) specifically related to bridge message validation for debugging and security monitoring.
    6.  **Sanitize validated data** *after bridge message validation* and before using it in any native operations. This sanitization should be tailored to the context of how the data will be used *after being received through the bridge*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Bridge (High Severity):** Malicious JavaScript can send crafted payloads through the bridge that, if not validated and sanitized *at the bridge entry point*, can be injected into the WebView or native UI, leading to XSS. This threat is directly related to the bridge as the communication channel.
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** If data received from JavaScript *via the bridge* is used in SQL queries without proper validation and sanitization *at the bridge handler*, attackers can inject malicious SQL code. This is a threat amplified by the bridge's ability to pass data to native code.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** If data from JavaScript *received through the bridge* is used to construct or execute system commands, lack of validation and sanitization *in the bridge handler* can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. The bridge facilitates this data flow.
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):** If JavaScript data *passed via the bridge* is used to access files or directories, insufficient validation *in the bridge handler* can allow attackers to access unauthorized file paths. The bridge is the conduit for this potentially malicious data.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Invalid or malformed data from JavaScript *sent through the bridge* can cause application logic errors, data corruption, or unexpected behavior in native code. The bridge is the mechanism for this data to reach native components.

*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS via Bridge: **High reduction**. Effective input validation and sanitization *specifically at the bridge interface* are crucial in preventing XSS attacks originating from bridge communication.
    *   SQL Injection: **High reduction**. Parameterized queries combined with input validation *of bridge messages* significantly mitigate SQL injection risks arising from bridge data.
    *   Command Injection: **High reduction**. Careful validation *of bridge inputs* and avoiding direct execution of commands with user-provided data greatly reduce command injection vulnerabilities introduced via the bridge.
    *   Path Traversal: **Medium reduction**. Validation *of bridge parameters* can limit unauthorized file access attempts originating from bridge calls.
    *   Data Integrity Issues: **Medium reduction**. Improves data quality and reduces logic errors caused by invalid input *received through the bridge*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic data type validation is present in some bridge handlers (e.g., checking if an ID is a number *in bridge handlers*). However, format validation and sanitization *of bridge messages* are not consistently applied across all bridge functions. Validation logic is scattered across different native handler classes *handling bridge calls*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing robust format validation (e.g., regex checks, URL validation) and allow-list validation for many bridge functions *handling incoming messages*. Sanitization is largely absent, especially for data used in logging, file operations, and database interactions *after being received via the bridge*. Centralized validation and sanitization routines *specifically for bridge messages* are not implemented, leading to inconsistent application of these measures at the bridge interface.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Bridge-Exposed Native Functions](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_bridge-exposed_native_functions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review all currently exposed native functions** accessible through `webviewjavascriptbridge`. This list represents the attack surface exposed *via the bridge*.
    2.  **For each *bridge-exposed* function, analyze its purpose and the minimum necessary permissions** it requires to perform its intended task *when called from JavaScript via the bridge*.
    3.  **Refactor or redesign *bridge-exposed* functions to minimize their scope and privileges.**  Instead of exposing general-purpose functions *through the bridge*, create more specific, limited-scope functions *specifically for bridge interaction*.
    4.  **Avoid exposing functions that perform sensitive operations** directly through the bridge if possible. If unavoidable, implement strict access controls and auditing *within the bridge handler*.
    5.  **Document the purpose, parameters, and security implications** of each *bridge-exposed* native function clearly for developers, emphasizing the risks associated with bridge-based access.
    6.  **Regularly audit the list of *bridge-exposed* functions** and remove any functions that are no longer needed or pose unnecessary security risks *when accessible via the bridge*.
    7.  **Implement access control mechanisms** *within bridge handler functions* if necessary. For example, check user roles or permissions before executing sensitive operations triggered via the bridge.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Native Functionality via Bridge (High Severity):** Exposing overly permissive or unnecessary native functions *through the bridge* increases the attack surface and allows malicious JavaScript to potentially access sensitive native features *via the bridge*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Bridge (Medium to High Severity):** If a compromised WebView or malicious JavaScript can call powerful native functions *through the bridge*, it could lead to privilege escalation within the application or even the device *due to bridge-mediated access*.
    *   **Data Breaches via Bridge (Medium to High Severity):**  Overly broad *bridge-exposed* native functions might inadvertently expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized data access if exploited *through the bridge*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Native Functionality via Bridge: **High reduction**. Limiting *bridge-exposed* functions to only what's necessary significantly reduces the attack surface accessible through the bridge.
    *   Privilege Escalation via Bridge: **Medium to High reduction**.  Restricting function scope and privileges *of bridge-exposed functions* makes it harder for attackers to escalate privileges through the bridge.
    *   Data Breaches via Bridge: **Medium reduction**. Reduces the potential for data breaches by limiting the functions *exposed via the bridge* that can access or manipulate sensitive data.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some native functions *exposed via the bridge* are designed with specific purposes. However, there are still some *bridge-exposed* functions with broader capabilities than strictly necessary, and the principle of least privilege is not consistently applied across all *bridge functionalities*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic review and refactoring of all *bridge-exposed* native functions to adhere to the principle of least privilege is missing.  No formal access control mechanisms are implemented *within bridge handler functions*. Documentation regarding the security implications of each *bridge-exposed* function is incomplete, especially concerning bridge-mediated access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Design and Implementation of Bridge Functions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_design_and_implementation_of_bridge_functions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer asynchronous communication for bridge calls:** Design bridge functions to use asynchronous message passing (e.g., using callbacks or promises) instead of synchronous calls whenever possible. This improves responsiveness and provides better control points for security checks *in bridge communication*.
    2.  **Implement proper error handling in bridge handlers:**
        *   In native code, handle potential errors gracefully within *bridge handler functions*.
        *   Return informative error messages to JavaScript when bridge calls fail, but avoid exposing sensitive internal error details *through the bridge response*.
        *   In JavaScript, implement error handling for bridge responses to gracefully manage failures and provide user feedback related to bridge operations.
    3.  **Implement logging and auditing for bridge activities:**
        *   Log relevant security events and errors specifically related to *bridge communication* in native code. This can include validation failures, unauthorized access attempts to bridge functions, and unexpected errors during bridge calls.
        *   Ensure logs are stored securely and reviewed regularly for security monitoring and incident response related to bridge usage.
        *   Consider auditing sensitive operations performed *through the bridge* to track actions and identify potential misuse of bridge functionalities.
    4.  **Keep bridge function implementations simple and focused:**  Avoid overly complex logic within *bridge handler functions*. Simpler bridge handlers are easier to review for security vulnerabilities and less likely to contain bugs in the bridge communication path.
    5.  **Conduct regular security code reviews of bridge handlers:**  Periodically review the code of all native functions *exposed through the bridge (bridge handlers)*, focusing on potential security vulnerabilities, input validation *within bridge handlers*, and adherence to secure coding practices in the bridge implementation.
    6.  **Perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments specifically targeting the bridge:** Include `webviewjavascriptbridge` and its functionalities in regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses in the bridge implementation and its exposed functions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Logic Errors and Unexpected Behavior in Bridge Communication (Medium Severity):** Complex *bridge handler functions* and lack of error handling in bridge communication can lead to logic errors and unexpected application behavior, potentially creating security vulnerabilities in the bridge interaction.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Bridge Error Messages (Low to Medium Severity):** Verbose error messages returned to JavaScript *through the bridge* could inadvertently expose sensitive information or aid attackers in understanding the application's internals via bridge responses.
    *   **Lack of Audit Trails for Bridge Usage (Low Severity):**  Insufficient logging and auditing of *bridge activities* can hinder security monitoring, incident response, and the ability to detect and investigate security incidents related to bridge usage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Logic Errors and Unexpected Behavior in Bridge Communication: **Medium reduction**. Simpler *bridge handlers* and proper error handling in bridge communication improve code reliability and reduce the likelihood of security-related bugs in the bridge interaction.
    *   Information Disclosure via Bridge Error Messages: **Low to Medium reduction**.  Carefully crafted error messages *in bridge responses* prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information through bridge communication.
    *   Lack of Audit Trails for Bridge Usage: **Low reduction**. Logging and auditing of *bridge activities* provide valuable security monitoring and incident response capabilities specifically for bridge-related security concerns.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Asynchronous communication is used in some bridge functions. Basic error handling is present in bridge handlers, but error messages might be too verbose in some cases *in bridge responses*. Logging is implemented for general application events, but specific *bridge-related security logging* is limited. Code reviews are conducted periodically, but not specifically focused on *bridge security*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consistent use of asynchronous communication across all bridge functions. Refined error handling in bridge handlers to prevent information disclosure *through bridge responses*. Dedicated security logging for *bridge activities*, including validation failures and access attempts to bridge functions. Regular, focused security code reviews specifically targeting *bridge handler functionalities*. Penetration testing explicitly covering `webviewjavascriptbridge` interactions.
