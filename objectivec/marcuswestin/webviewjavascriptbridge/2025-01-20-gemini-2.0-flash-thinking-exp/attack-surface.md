## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Native Function Calls from WebView](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_native_function_calls_from_webview.md)

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript within the WebView can trigger the execution of arbitrary native functions within the application.

**How webviewjavascriptbridge Contributes:** The core functionality of the bridge is to facilitate communication between JavaScript and native code. If the bridge doesn't strictly control which native functions can be called and with what arguments, it opens this attack vector.

**Example:** A compromised website loaded in the WebView uses the bridge to call a native function that deletes user data or accesses sensitive device information.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's device, including data theft, malware installation, and unauthorized actions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Whitelist Allowed Native Functions:** Implement a strict whitelist of native functions that can be called from the WebView.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data passed from the WebView to native functions to prevent injection attacks.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only expose the necessary native functionality through the bridge. Avoid exposing internal or sensitive APIs.
* **Authentication/Authorization:** Implement mechanisms to verify the origin and legitimacy of calls from the WebView before executing native functions.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection/Manipulation in Native Calls](./attack_surfaces/data_injectionmanipulation_in_native_calls.md)

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript can inject or manipulate data passed as arguments to native function calls, leading to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities.

**How webviewjavascriptbridge Contributes:** The bridge acts as the conduit for passing data between the WebView and native code. If this data is not treated carefully on the native side, it can be exploited.

**Example:** JavaScript injects malicious SQL code into a parameter intended for a database query executed by a native function.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, application crashes, or the execution of arbitrary code within the native context.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strong Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on the native side for all data received from the WebView.
* **Type Checking:** Enforce strict type checking for arguments passed to native functions.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices on the native side to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection or command injection.
* **Consider Data Serialization/Deserialization:** Use secure serialization/deserialization techniques to ensure data integrity during transmission.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Injection from Native to WebView](./attack_surfaces/javascript_injection_from_native_to_webview.md)

**Description:** The native application might inject JavaScript code into the WebView based on user input or data from untrusted sources, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the WebView.

**How webviewjavascriptbridge Contributes:** The bridge often provides mechanisms for the native side to send data or commands to the WebView, which can involve injecting JavaScript.

**Example:** The native application displays a user's comment in the WebView, and the comment contains malicious JavaScript that the native side didn't sanitize before injecting it.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the WebView, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Direct JavaScript Injection:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly injecting raw JavaScript. Prefer passing data and manipulating the DOM using safe APIs within the WebView.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP for the WebView to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.
* **Secure Templating/Rendering:** Use secure templating engines or rendering libraries within the WebView to prevent the interpretation of user-supplied data as executable code.
* **Contextual Output Encoding:**  Properly encode data before injecting it into the WebView based on the context (e.g., HTML escaping).

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Native Data to WebView](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_native_data_to_webview.md)

**Description:** The native application might inadvertently expose sensitive data to the WebView through the bridge, making it accessible to potentially malicious JavaScript.

**How webviewjavascriptbridge Contributes:** The bridge is used to transfer data from the native side to the WebView. If sensitive data is passed without proper consideration, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** The native application passes a user's authentication token or API key to the WebView for convenience, but this token could be accessed by malicious scripts.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, potential account compromise, and other security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Minimize Data Exposure:** Only pass the necessary data to the WebView. Avoid sending sensitive information if it's not absolutely required.
* **Secure Storage in WebView:** If sensitive data must be stored in the WebView, use secure storage mechanisms like `IndexedDB` with encryption.
* **Tokenization/Abstraction:** Instead of passing raw sensitive data, consider using tokens or abstract identifiers that have limited scope and lifespan.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential data exposure issues.
