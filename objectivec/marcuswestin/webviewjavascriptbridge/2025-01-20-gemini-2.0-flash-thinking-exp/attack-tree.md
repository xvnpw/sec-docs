## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via webviewjavascriptbridge (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_webviewjavascriptbridge__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the `webviewjavascriptbridge` integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Web-to-Native Communication (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_web-to-native_communication__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker successfully leveraging the communication channel from the WebView to the native application to execute malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Data with Malicious Characters (e.g., SQL injection if native code interacts with DB) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/send_data_with_malicious_characters__e_g___sql_injection_if_native_code_interacts_with_db___high_ris_2f0c133b.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker crafts malicious JSON payloads containing characters that, when processed by the native code (especially if it interacts with a database), are interpreted as commands rather than data.
* Example: Sending a string like `"username": "'; DROP TABLE users; --"` if the native code directly uses this in an SQL query without sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Call Unintended Native Methods (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/call_unintended_native_methods__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker's ability to invoke native functions that they are not authorized to access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Access Control on Native Methods (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_access_control_on_native_methods__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker identifies and calls native methods that should be restricted but are accessible due to missing or inadequate access control mechanisms.
* Example: Calling a native method that allows direct file system access or privileged operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Input Validation on Native Side (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_input_validation_on_native_side__critical_node_.md)

This signifies the attacker successfully sending data that circumvents the native application's checks and filters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Flaws due to Unvalidated Input (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_flaws_due_to_unvalidated_input__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker sends data that, while not triggering explicit validation errors, exploits flaws in the native application's logic due to assumptions made about the input data.
* Example: Sending a negative number for an operation that assumes a positive value, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Native-to-Web Communication (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_native-to-web_communication__critical_node_.md)

This represents the attacker successfully leveraging the communication channel from the native application to the WebView to inject malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Scripts into WebView (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_scripts_into_webview__critical_node_.md)

This is the core of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in this context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Output Sanitization in Native Code (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_output_sanitization_in_native_code__critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: The native application sends data to the WebView without properly encoding or escaping characters that have special meaning in HTML or JavaScript.
* Example: Sending a string like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>` directly to the WebView without escaping the angle brackets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary JavaScript in WebView Context (XSS) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_javascript_in_webview_context__xss___critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Due to the lack of output sanitization, malicious JavaScript code injected by the attacker is executed within the WebView, gaining access to the WebView's context, including cookies, local storage, and the ability to make API calls.
* Consequences: Stealing user credentials, session hijacking, performing actions on behalf of the user, redirecting the user to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in webviewjavascriptbridge Library Itself (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_webviewjavascriptbridge_library_itself__critical_node_.md)

This involves directly exploiting security flaws within the `webviewjavascriptbridge` library code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Bugs or Security Flaws (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_bugs_or_security_flaws__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker identifies and exploits publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific version of the `webviewjavascriptbridge` library being used by the application.
* Example: Exploiting a known buffer overflow or remote code execution vulnerability in an outdated version of the library.
