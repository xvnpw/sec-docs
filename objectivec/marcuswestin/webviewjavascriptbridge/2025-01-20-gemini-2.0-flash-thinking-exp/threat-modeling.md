# Threat Model Analysis for marcuswestin/webviewjavascriptbridge

## Threat: [Arbitrary Native Function Invocation from Malicious JavaScript](./threats/arbitrary_native_function_invocation_from_malicious_javascript.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects or introduces malicious JavaScript code into the WebView. This code then uses the `WebViewJavascriptBridge` to call native functions exposed by the application. The attacker can call these functions with unexpected or malicious arguments.
    * **Impact:**  The attacker could trigger unintended actions within the native application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to device resources (camera, microphone, location), execution of arbitrary code on the device, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** `WebViewJavascriptBridge`'s core message handling mechanism (`send`, `callHandler`, `registerHandler`) and the exposed native function handlers.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Minimize Exposed Native Functions: Only expose the absolutely necessary native functions through the bridge.
        * Strict Input Validation on Native Side: Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all arguments received by native function handlers. Treat all data from JavaScript as untrusted.
        * Whitelist Allowed Handlers: If possible, implement a whitelist of allowed JavaScript handlers that can be called from the native side.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the native functions exposed through the bridge operate with the minimum necessary privileges.
        * Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews of both the JavaScript and native code interacting with the bridge.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Exposed Native Function Return Values](./threats/information_disclosure_via_exposed_native_function_return_values.md)

* **Description:** A native function exposed through the bridge returns sensitive information to the JavaScript environment. Malicious JavaScript can then access and exfiltrate this data.
    * **Impact:**  Sensitive user data, application secrets, internal system information, or other confidential data could be exposed to the attacker.
    * **Affected Component:** `WebViewJavascriptBridge`'s response mechanism for native function calls and the specific native functions returning sensitive data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Careful Data Handling in Native Functions:  Avoid returning sensitive information directly through bridge calls. If necessary, sanitize or mask the data before sending it to JavaScript.
        * Review Return Values:  Thoroughly review the data returned by each exposed native function to ensure no unintended information is leaked.
        * Consider Alternative Communication Patterns: If possible, use alternative communication patterns where sensitive data is not directly passed through the bridge.

## Threat: [Message Tampering During Bridge Communication](./threats/message_tampering_during_bridge_communication.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts the messages being passed between the JavaScript in the WebView and the native application through the `WebViewJavascriptBridge`. The attacker modifies these messages before they reach their intended recipient.
    * **Impact:** This could lead to the native application performing unintended actions based on the modified messages, or the JavaScript displaying incorrect or manipulated data. For example, modifying a payment amount or altering user settings.
    * **Affected Component:** The underlying message passing mechanism of `WebViewJavascriptBridge`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement Message Signing: Implement a mechanism to sign messages on the sender side (either native or JavaScript) and verify the signature on the receiver side to ensure message integrity.
        * Encryption of Messages: Encrypt the messages being passed through the bridge to prevent attackers from understanding and modifying the content.
        * Secure Communication Channels: Ensure the underlying communication channel (e.g., the WebView's internal communication) is as secure as possible.

## Threat: [Message Spoofing in Bridge Communication](./threats/message_spoofing_in_bridge_communication.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends malicious messages to either the native application or the JavaScript within the WebView, impersonating the legitimate sender.
    * **Impact:** This could trick the native application into executing malicious commands or the JavaScript into displaying misleading information or initiating harmful actions. For example, a malicious website loaded in the WebView could send messages pretending to be the native application.
    * **Affected Component:** The message identification and routing mechanism within `WebViewJavascriptBridge`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Authentication and Authorization: Implement mechanisms to authenticate the origin of messages and authorize actions based on the sender.
        * Unique Identifiers for Communication Channels: Use unique identifiers for communication channels to prevent cross-channel interference or spoofing.
        * Validate Message Origin:  On both the native and JavaScript sides, validate the expected origin of incoming messages.

## Threat: [Native Code Injection Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/native_code_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* **Description:** The native application incorrectly handles data received from JavaScript through the bridge and then injects this unsanitized data back into the WebView's content, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the WebView, allowing them to steal user data, manipulate the UI, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Affected Component:** The native code that processes data received from the bridge and the mechanism used to update the WebView's content.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Output Encoding on Native Side: Properly encode data received from JavaScript before injecting it back into the WebView's content. Use context-appropriate encoding (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML content).
        * Secure Templating Engines: If using templating engines on the native side to generate WebView content, ensure they are configured to prevent XSS.
        * Code Reviews: Carefully review the native code that handles data from the bridge and updates the WebView.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `webviewjavascriptbridge` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__webviewjavascriptbridge__library_itself.md)

* **Description:** The `webviewjavascriptbridge` library itself contains security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious JavaScript or through crafted messages.
    * **Impact:** This could have a wide range of impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially allowing attackers to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access, or cause application crashes.
    * **Affected Component:** The core modules and functions of the `webviewjavascriptbridge` library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Library Updated: Regularly update the `webviewjavascriptbridge` library to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
        * Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about any security advisories or known vulnerabilities related to the library.
        * Consider Alternative Libraries: If significant security concerns arise with `webviewjavascriptbridge`, consider using alternative, more actively maintained and audited libraries.
