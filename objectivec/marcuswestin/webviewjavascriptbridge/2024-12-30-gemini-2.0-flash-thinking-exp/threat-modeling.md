Here are the high and critical threats directly involving `WebViewJavascriptBridge`:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Message Injection from JavaScript to Native
    *   **Description:** An attacker, having compromised the JavaScript context within the WebView, crafts and sends malicious messages through the `WebViewJavascriptBridge` to the native application. This could involve calling registered handlers with unexpected or harmful arguments.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could trigger unintended actions in the native application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to device resources, or even remote code execution if the native handlers are not properly secured.
    *   **Affected Component:** `WebViewJavascriptBridge`'s message sending and receiving mechanism, specifically the JavaScript-to-native communication channel and the native message handlers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the native side for all data received from JavaScript through the bridge.
        *   Use whitelisting of allowed message types and parameters on the native side.
        *   Avoid directly mapping JavaScript input to critical native function calls without thorough validation.
        *   Implement proper authentication/authorization checks within the native handlers to ensure the caller has the necessary permissions.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Message Injection from Native to JavaScript
    *   **Description:** An attacker who has compromised the native application could inject malicious JavaScript code or craft malicious messages that are sent to the WebView through the `WebViewJavascriptBridge`.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the WebView, potentially leading to data theft from the WebView's context, UI manipulation, or further exploitation of vulnerabilities within the web content.
    *   **Affected Component:** `WebViewJavascriptBridge`'s message sending mechanism, specifically the native-to-JavaScript communication channel.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the native application code to prevent compromise.
        *   Implement output encoding on the native side when sending data to the WebView to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
        *   Avoid sending sensitive data directly to the WebView if possible.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Input Validation on Native Side
    *   **Description:** The native code might not properly validate data received from JavaScript through the `WebViewJavascriptBridge`, leading to vulnerabilities if the JavaScript sends unexpected or malicious input.
    *   **Impact:** This could lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even security vulnerabilities if the unvalidated data is used in sensitive operations (e.g., database queries, file system access).
    *   **Affected Component:** Native message handlers and any native code processing data received from JavaScript via the bridge.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement thorough input validation for all data received from JavaScript, including type checking, range checks, and sanitization.
        *   Treat all data received from the WebView as potentially untrusted.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Output Encoding on Native Side
    *   **Description:** Data sent from the native side to JavaScript through the `WebViewJavascriptBridge` might not be properly encoded for the WebView context, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the WebView.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the WebView, potentially stealing user data, performing actions on their behalf, or further compromising the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** The native message sending mechanism and any native code that constructs data to be sent to the WebView.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper encoding of all data sent to the WebView, especially when displaying user-generated content or data from external sources.
        *   Use context-aware encoding techniques appropriate for HTML, JavaScript, or URLs.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in WebViewJavascriptBridge Library
    *   **Description:** The `WebViewJavascriptBridge` library itself might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
    *   **Impact:** This could allow attackers to bypass the intended communication mechanisms or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core modules and functions of the `WebViewJavascriptBridge` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `WebViewJavascriptBridge` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Regularly review the library's codebase for potential vulnerabilities or rely on security audits.
        *   Consider using alternative, more actively maintained or audited bridging solutions if concerns arise.
