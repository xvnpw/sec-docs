## Threat: [Unexpected Drawer Visibility Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/unexpected_drawer_visibility_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unexpected Drawer Visibility Leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in `MMDrawerController`'s state management logic or animation handling to programmatically force the drawer into an open state, even when it should be closed based on application logic. This could involve manipulating internal state variables or triggering specific animation sequences unexpectedly through the library's methods.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to features or information intended to be hidden when the drawer is closed. This could include accessing settings, viewing sensitive data displayed in the drawer's content view controllers, or triggering unintended actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `MMDrawerController`'s state management logic, `openDrawerSide:animated:completion:` and `closeDrawerAnimated:completion:` methods, potentially animation handling within the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust state management for the drawer, ensuring the drawer's visibility is controlled by explicit logic and not solely reliant on the library's default behavior.
        *   Validate the drawer's state before granting access to sensitive functionalities, regardless of the library's reported state.
        *   Thoroughly test drawer transitions and state changes under various conditions, including edge cases and potential race conditions within the library's state management.

## Threat: [Injection Attacks via Dynamically Loaded Drawer Content](./threats/injection_attacks_via_dynamically_loaded_drawer_content.md)

*   **Threat:** Injection Attacks via Dynamically Loaded Drawer Content
    *   **Description:** If the application uses view controllers within the drawer to display content loaded dynamically and the rendering mechanism (e.g., a web view) is vulnerable, an attacker could inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript if using a web view) that gets executed within the context of the application when the drawer is opened. While the vulnerability might be in the rendering component, the drawer's role in presenting the content makes it a direct involvement.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities within the application's context.
    *   **Affected Component:** The view controllers and views used to display content within the drawer, *as presented by* `MMDrawerController`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all data received from external sources before displaying it in the drawer's content views.
        *   If using web views within the drawer, implement robust security measures to prevent XSS attacks (e.g., using secure coding practices, setting appropriate security headers).
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege when loading external content within the drawer, limiting the permissions and capabilities of the rendering context.
