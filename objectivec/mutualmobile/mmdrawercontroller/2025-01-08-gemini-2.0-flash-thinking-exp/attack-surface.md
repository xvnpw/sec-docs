# Attack Surface Analysis for mutualmobile/mmdrawercontroller

## Attack Surface: [Drawer State Manipulation and Race Conditions](./attack_surfaces/drawer_state_manipulation_and_race_conditions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to manipulate the drawer's open/closed state rapidly or unexpectedly, potentially leading to race conditions or inconsistent UI states that bypass intended security checks.
    *   **How `mmdrawercontroller` Contributes:** The library's internal mechanisms for managing and transitioning the drawer's state can be vulnerable to race conditions if not handled robustly. Rapid or conflicting calls to open/close methods or manipulations of related properties can expose these weaknesses.
    *   **Example:** Repeatedly and rapidly calling `openDrawerSide:` and `closeDrawerAnimated:` on the `MMDrawerController` instance could lead to UI glitches, bypass animation-based security indicators, or trigger unintended logic based on an inconsistent drawer state.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security checks based on drawer visibility, unexpected application behavior, potential denial of service due to resource exhaustion from rapid animations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust state management for the drawer at the application level, avoiding direct manipulation of the drawer state in rapid succession without proper synchronization.
        *   Avoid relying solely on the visual state of the drawer for critical security decisions; use underlying application state instead.
        *   Consider implementing debouncing or throttling mechanisms for drawer open/close actions triggered by user input or programmatic calls.
        *   Thoroughly test state transitions under various conditions, including rapid and concurrent interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Functionality Exposure through Drawer](./attack_surfaces/unintended_functionality_exposure_through_drawer.md)

*   **Description:** Functionality intended for specific contexts or user roles is inadvertently exposed through the drawer, allowing unauthorized access or actions.
    *   **How `mmdrawercontroller` Contributes:** The library provides a straightforward mechanism for presenting different view controllers within the drawer. If the application logic governing which view controllers are presented is flawed or lacks proper authorization checks, sensitive functionalities can be unintentionally exposed.
    *   **Example:** Administrative functions or settings are presented as options in the drawer's menu without properly verifying the user's privileges before displaying or allowing interaction with these options.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities, potential for data manipulation, privilege escalation, or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict authorization checks before presenting any functionality or options within the drawer.
        *   Ensure that the logic determining which drawer options are visible is based on the current user's roles and permissions.
        *   Avoid directly mapping internal application functionalities to drawer items without proper access control layers.

## Attack Surface: [Delegate Method Misuse and Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/delegate_method_misuse_and_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Developers implement delegate methods provided by `mmdrawercontroller` incorrectly, introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   **How `mmdrawercontroller` Contributes:** The library relies on delegate methods (e.g., those related to drawer state changes or gesture handling) to allow customization. Incorrect or insecure implementations of these delegates can introduce vulnerabilities that are directly triggered by the library's actions.
    *   **Example:** A delegate method intended to control whether the drawer can be opened based on certain conditions has a logical flaw or lacks proper input validation, allowing the drawer to open under unintended or malicious circumstances.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing intended restrictions, unexpected application behavior, potential for information disclosure or unauthorized actions depending on the logic within the vulnerable delegate method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and thoroughly test the implementation of all delegate methods used with `mmdrawercontroller`.
        *   Ensure proper input validation and error handling within delegate methods to prevent unexpected behavior or security flaws.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom logic within delegate methods, especially when dealing with sensitive operations or data.
