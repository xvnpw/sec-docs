# Attack Surface Analysis for mutualmobile/mmdrawercontroller

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Drawer Content Access (Programmatic Bypass - *Due to MMDrawerController API Misuse*)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_drawer_content_access__programmatic_bypass_-_due_to_mmdrawercontroller_api_misuse_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive information or functionality within the drawer due to incorrect usage of the `MMDrawerController` API for controlling drawer visibility.  This is a direct result of how the developer interacts with the library.
    *   **MMDrawerController Contribution:** The library provides the methods (`openDrawerSide:`, `closeDrawerAnimated:`, etc.) that, if used incorrectly, create the vulnerability.  The *mechanism* of the drawer is directly involved.
    *   **Example:** A developer forgets to check user authentication status *before* calling `openDrawerSide:completion:` in a specific code path, allowing an unauthenticated user to open the drawer.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (sensitive user information), unauthorized access to functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data/functionality).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust authorization checks *before* calling any `MMDrawerController` methods that control drawer visibility.  This is the *core* mitigation.
            *   Thoroughly test *all* code paths that interact with the `MMDrawerController` API, including edge cases and error conditions.  Focus specifically on how authorization is handled in relation to drawer opening/closing.
            *   Use a consistent and secure pattern for managing drawer state and access control.  Avoid ad-hoc checks scattered throughout the codebase.
            *   Consider creating a wrapper class or helper functions around `MMDrawerController` to centralize and enforce access control logic. This makes it easier to audit and maintain.
