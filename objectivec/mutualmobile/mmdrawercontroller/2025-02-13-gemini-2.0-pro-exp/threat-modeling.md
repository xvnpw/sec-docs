# Threat Model Analysis for mutualmobile/mmdrawercontroller

## Threat: [Unauthorized Drawer Opening/Manipulation via External Input](./threats/unauthorized_drawer_openingmanipulation_via_external_input.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious application (or a compromised website via deep linking) sends crafted URL scheme requests or IPC messages. These messages exploit a lack of validation in the application's handling of these external inputs, directly targeting the `MMDrawerController` API to force the drawer to open or change its content. The attacker leverages the *application's integration* with `MMDrawerController` to bypass intended access controls.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive information displayed within the drawer.
    *   Unauthorized access to features accessible *only* through the drawer.
    *   Potential injection of malicious content if the drawer dynamically loads data based on the external input that controls `MMDrawerController`.
*   **Affected Component:** The application's implementation of URL scheme handlers and IPC mechanisms that directly interact with `MMDrawerController` methods. Specifically, code that receives external requests and then calls `MMDrawerController`'s `open(_:animated:completion:)`, `closeDrawer(animated:completion:)`, or methods that update the drawer's content *based on that external input*. The vulnerability lies in how the application uses `MMDrawerController` in response to untrusted data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if sensitive data or critical functionality is exposed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorously validate *all* data received via URL schemes or IPC *before* passing it to any `MMDrawerController` methods. Check data types, lengths, formats, and expected values. Reject any invalid input.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Before allowing external requests to manipulate the `MMDrawerController`, verify the requesting application's identity (if possible) and ensure it has the necessary permissions. This is crucial for any IPC or URL scheme that controls the drawer.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid using external control (URL schemes/IPC) for sensitive `MMDrawerController` operations. Prefer internal application state management for critical actions, minimizing the attack surface.
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent injection vulnerabilities, especially when handling external input that affects the drawer's content or state.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Rapid State Changes Targeting MMDrawerController](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_rapid_state_changes_targeting_mmdrawercontroller.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker (malicious app or user with debugging tools) repeatedly and rapidly triggers state changes *specifically on the `MMDrawerController`* (opening/closing). This is done by exploiting any available interface (URL scheme, IPC, or even direct UI manipulation if possible) to call `MMDrawerController`'s open/close methods in rapid succession. The attack focuses on overwhelming the library's animation and state management.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) caused by `MMDrawerController`'s rapid animation cycles and any associated content updates triggered by those state changes.
    *   User experience is severely degraded.
*   **Affected Component:** The `MMDrawerController` itself, specifically its animation logic and state management functions. The attack targets the core functionality of the library related to opening and closing the drawer. The application code that *calls* `MMDrawerController`'s open/close methods is the vector, but the vulnerability is in how the library handles (or fails to handle) rapid state transitions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if it leads to a reliable application crash).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Applied to MMDrawerController Calls):** Implement rate limiting *specifically on calls to `MMDrawerController`'s open/close methods*. Prevent the drawer from being opened or closed more than a certain number of times within a given time period. This protects the library directly.
    *   **Debouncing (Applied to MMDrawerController Calls):** Use debouncing techniques to ignore rapid, successive open/close requests *to `MMDrawerController`*. Only process the first or last request in a series of rapid events, preventing the library from being overwhelmed.
    *   **Performance Optimization (of Drawer Content):** While not directly mitigating the `MMDrawerController` attack, optimizing the drawer's content and rendering can reduce the impact of rapid state changes. This is a secondary mitigation.
    *   **Asynchronous Operations (for Drawer-Triggered Actions):** Ensure that any network requests or long-running operations triggered by `MMDrawerController`'s state changes are handled asynchronously and don't block the main thread, reducing the likelihood of a complete freeze.
