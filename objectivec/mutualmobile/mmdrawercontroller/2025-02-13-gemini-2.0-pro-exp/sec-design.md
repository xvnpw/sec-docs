# Project Design Document: MMDrawerController

## BUSINESS POSTURE

*   Priorities and Goals:
    *   Provide a simple, easy-to-use, and customizable side drawer navigation component for iOS applications.
    *   Offer a lightweight alternative to more complex side drawer libraries.
    *   Maintain high performance and responsiveness.
    *   Ensure compatibility with a wide range of iOS versions and devices.
    *   Provide clear documentation and examples for easy adoption.
    *   Minimize external dependencies.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Usability issues: If the component is difficult to use or customize, developers may choose alternative solutions.
    *   Performance bottlenecks: Slow or unresponsive drawer animations could negatively impact the user experience of applications using the component.
    *   Compatibility problems: Incompatibility with certain iOS versions or devices could limit the component's adoption.
    *   Security vulnerabilities: Although primarily a UI component, potential vulnerabilities could be exploited if user input or sensitive data is mishandled.
    *   Lack of maintenance: If the project is not actively maintained, bugs and compatibility issues may arise over time, leading to developer frustration.
    *   Lack of features: If project is not supporting features that are supported by alternatives, developers may choose alternative solutions.

## SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: Code Reviews: The project's GitHub repository shows evidence of collaboration and code review, which helps identify potential security issues.
    *   security control: Static Analysis: While not explicitly mentioned, it's common practice to use static analysis tools (like those built into Xcode) during iOS development to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   security control: Community Scrutiny: As an open-source project, MMDrawerController benefits from community scrutiny, where users can report bugs and potential security issues.

*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: Limited Input Validation: As a UI component, MMDrawerController likely has limited direct user input. The primary responsibility for input validation rests with the application using the component.
    *   accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities: While the project aims to minimize dependencies, any included dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to regularly scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   security control: Implement fuzz testing to identify potential vulnerabilities related to unexpected input or edge cases.
    *   security control: Establish a clear security vulnerability reporting process.

*   Security Requirements:

    *   Authentication: Not directly applicable to this UI component. Authentication should be handled by the application using the component.
    *   Authorization: Not directly applicable. Authorization should be handled by the application.
    *   Input Validation: The component should handle any internal data manipulation safely, but the primary responsibility for input validation lies with the application using it.
    *   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, unless the component is used to display or manage sensitive data, in which case the application should handle encryption/decryption.

### DEPLOYMENT

MMDrawerController is a library/component, not a standalone application. Therefore, it doesn't have its own deployment process in the traditional sense.  It is *integrated* into an iOS application, and the deployment process is that of the *hosting application*.  Here are the possible deployment scenarios:

1.  **Direct Integration (Source Code):**  The developer copies the MMDrawerController source code directly into their iOS project.
2.  **CocoaPods:** The developer uses CocoaPods, a dependency manager, to include MMDrawerController in their project.
3.  **Carthage:**  The developer uses Carthage, another dependency manager, to include MMDrawerController.
4.  **Swift Package Manager:** The developer uses Swift Package Manager (SPM) to include MMDrawerController.

We'll describe the deployment process assuming CocoaPods, as it's a common method.

### BUILD

The build process for MMDrawerController itself is typically handled by Xcode when it's integrated into a project. However, the library *itself* likely has a build process for development and testing.  This would involve compiling the Swift code, running unit tests, and potentially generating documentation.  Since it's a library, the "build artifact" is the compiled component ready to be linked into an iOS application.

* Security Controls in Build Process:

    *   Code Review:  All changes should be reviewed before merging into the main branch.
    *   Static Analysis: Xcode's built-in static analyzer should be used to identify potential code issues.
    *   Unit Tests:  A comprehensive suite of unit tests should be run as part of the build process to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
    *   Dependency Management (if applicable): If the project uses CocoaPods, Carthage, or SPM, regular updates and vulnerability scans of dependencies are crucial.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Providing a functional and user-friendly side drawer navigation component.
    *   Maintaining the component's compatibility with iOS updates.
    *   Ensuring the component's performance and responsiveness.

*   Data Protection:
    *   MMDrawerController itself does not handle sensitive user data directly.  It's a UI component.  The *application* using MMDrawerController is responsible for protecting any sensitive data it handles.
    *   Data Sensitivity:  Not applicable to the component itself.  The sensitivity of data handled by the *application* using the component would depend on the application's purpose.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   Are there any specific performance benchmarks or targets for the component?
    *   Are there plans to support specific accessibility features?
    *   What is the long-term maintenance plan for the project?
    *   Are there any plans to add support for other dependency managers (e.g., Swift Package Manager)?
    *   What is the minimum supported iOS version?
    *   Are there any plans for supporting SwiftUI?

*   Assumptions:
    *   The primary use case is for standard side drawer navigation in iOS applications.
    *   The component is not intended to handle sensitive user data directly.
    *   Developers integrating the component are responsible for the security of their own applications.
    *   The project is maintained by the open-source community, with contributions and issue reports welcome.
    *   The project aims to remain lightweight and minimize external dependencies.
    *   The project is written in Swift (or a mix of Swift and Objective-C).
