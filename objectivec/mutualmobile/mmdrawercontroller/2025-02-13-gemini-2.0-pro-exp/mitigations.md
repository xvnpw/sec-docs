# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mutualmobile/mmdrawercontroller

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust State Management for Drawer Open/Close](./mitigation_strategies/robust_state_management_for_drawer_openclose.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define a State Enum:** Create a Swift `enum` to represent the drawer's possible states (e.g., `DrawerState { case open, closed, opening, closing }`).  This enum should be specific to the states provided and managed by `MMDrawerController`.
2.  **Centralized State Manager:** Implement a singleton or a dedicated class (e.g., `DrawerStateManager`) to hold the current `DrawerState`.  This class should *directly interact* with `MMDrawerController`'s methods and properties to get and set the drawer's state.  For example, use `mmDrawerController.openDrawerSide(...)` and `mmDrawerController.closeDrawer(...)` within the state manager's methods, and use `mmDrawerController.openSide` to query the current state.  *Do not* manage the state independently of the library.
3.  **Data Loading Based on MMDrawerController State:** Within the drawer's view controllers, use `MMDrawerController`'s delegate methods (if available) or KVO (Key-Value Observing) on `MMDrawerController`'s properties (like `openSide`) to detect state changes.  *Only* load and display sensitive data when `MMDrawerController` reports that the drawer is fully open.
4.  **Data Clearing on MMDrawerController Closure:** Similarly, use delegate methods or KVO to detect when `MMDrawerController` is closing the drawer.  *Immediately* clear any sensitive data in the drawer's view controllers when the drawer begins to close, as reported by `MMDrawerController`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Leakage (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive data from being displayed when the drawer is in an intermediate state (opening, closing) managed by `MMDrawerController`.
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Ensures data is only loaded when `MMDrawerController` indicates the drawer is fully open and accessible.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Risk significantly reduced. Data visibility is directly tied to `MMDrawerController`'s reported state.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced. Data loading depends on `MMDrawerController`'s open state.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   State Enum: Implemented in `DrawerState.swift`.
*   Centralized State Manager: Partially implemented in `DrawerStateManager.swift`. State transitions are *not* fully synchronized with `MMDrawerController`'s methods.
*   Data Loading/Clearing: Not implemented; relies on view controller lifecycle methods instead of `MMDrawerController`'s state.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `DrawerStateManager.swift`:  Must be refactored to *directly* use `MMDrawerController`'s methods and properties for state management.
*   All drawer view controllers:  Must use `MMDrawerController`'s delegate methods or KVO to trigger data loading and clearing, *not* standard view controller lifecycle methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Correct MMDrawerController View Controller Containment](./mitigation_strategies/correct_mmdrawercontroller_view_controller_containment.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Strict Adherence to Apple's Guidelines:** When initializing and setting up `MMDrawerController`, meticulously follow Apple's guidelines for view controller containment.  This is *crucial* for `MMDrawerController` to function correctly.
2.  **Correct Method Calls:** Ensure that `addChild`, `didMove(toParent:)`, `removeFromParent`, and `willMove(toParent:)` are called in the *precise* order specified by Apple's documentation when adding or removing the center view controller and the drawer view controllers to/from the `MMDrawerController` instance.  Incorrect usage can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior *within* `MMDrawerController`.
3.  **MMDrawerController Lifecycle Awareness:** Understand how `MMDrawerController` manages the lifecycles of its child view controllers.  Avoid making assumptions about the lifecycle events of the drawer's view controllers based solely on standard iOS behavior.  Test thoroughly to ensure proper behavior.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Memory Leaks (Severity: Medium):** Incorrect containment can cause `MMDrawerController` to retain view controllers improperly, leading to leaks.
*   **Unexpected Behavior (Severity: Medium):** Incorrect lifecycle management can cause `MMDrawerController` to behave unpredictably, potentially leading to UI glitches or crashes.

**Impact:**
*   **Memory Leaks:** Risk significantly reduced by ensuring correct containment and lifecycle management *within* `MMDrawerController`.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduced by adhering to Apple's guidelines and understanding `MMDrawerController`'s internal workings.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Containment Guidelines: Partially followed, but needs a thorough review in the code where `MMDrawerController` is initialized and configured.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `AppDelegate.swift` (or wherever `MMDrawerController` is set up):  A complete review and refactoring are needed to ensure *strict* adherence to Apple's containment guidelines, specifically in the context of how `MMDrawerController` uses them.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Deep Link Integration with MMDrawerController](./mitigation_strategies/secure_deep_link_integration_with_mmdrawercontroller.md)

**Description:** (Only if deep links control `MMDrawerController`)
1.  **Indirect Drawer Control:** If deep links are used to open or close the drawer, or to navigate to specific content within the drawer, *do not* directly manipulate the drawer's state using the deep link parameters.  Instead, use the deep link to navigate to a specific view controller *within* your application.
2.  **MMDrawerController Interaction in View Controller:**  Within that view controller, *then* use `MMDrawerController`'s methods (e.g., `openDrawerSide`, `closeDrawer`) to control the drawer's state.  This separation prevents direct manipulation of `MMDrawerController` from potentially malicious deep link input.
3.  **Authorization Before MMDrawerController Action:** Before calling any `MMDrawerController` methods in response to a deep link, perform an authorization check (using a centralized `AuthorizationManager`, as described in previous responses, but this is a general good practice, not *directly* related to MMDrawerController).  Only interact with `MMDrawerController` if the user is authorized.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from using malicious deep links to directly control `MMDrawerController` and bypass authorization.
*   **Unexpected State (Severity: Medium):** Prevents deep links from putting `MMDrawerController` into an unexpected or invalid state.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced. Deep links cannot directly manipulate `MMDrawerController`.
*   **Unexpected State:** Risk reduced by controlling `MMDrawerController` through a dedicated view controller.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Indirect Drawer Control: Not implemented. Deep links might directly call `MMDrawerController` methods.
*   Authorization Before Action: Not implemented in the context of deep links.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Deep link handling logic:  Must be refactored to navigate to a view controller *first*, and *then* interact with `MMDrawerController` within that view controller, after authorization checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep MMDrawerController Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_mmdrawercontroller_updated.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager) to include `MMDrawerController` in your project.
2.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly check for updates to the `MMDrawerController` library.  Update to the latest version promptly, especially if the changelog mentions security fixes or bug fixes related to view controller management or state handling.  This is crucial because vulnerabilities *could* exist within the library itself.
3. **Review Changelogs:** Before updating, carefully review the changelog for the new version. Look for any changes that might affect your application's functionality or security.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable, potentially High):** Directly addresses vulnerabilities that might be discovered and patched within the `MMDrawerController` library itself.

**Impact:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced by applying updates that contain security fixes.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Dependency Management: CocoaPods is used.
*   Regular Updates: Updates are performed occasionally, but not on a regular, proactive schedule.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Establish a formal schedule for checking and applying updates to `MMDrawerController` (and all other dependencies).
