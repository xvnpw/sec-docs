Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the `MMDrawerController` library.

## Deep Analysis: Unauthorized Drawer Open/Close (Attack Tree Path 1.1.2)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that could allow an attacker to achieve unauthorized opening or closing of the drawer managed by `MMDrawerController`.  We aim to identify specific code weaknesses, configuration flaws, and exploitation techniques.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to mitigate these risks and enhance the security of applications using this library.

**1.2 Scope:**

*   **Target Library:** `MMDrawerController` (https://github.com/mutualmobile/mmdrawercontroller)
*   **Attack Path:** 1.1.2 Unauthorized Drawer Open/Close
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   Direct method invocation vulnerabilities.
    *   Property manipulation vulnerabilities.
    *   Bypassing access control mechanisms.
    *   Exploitation via URL schemes (if applicable).
    *   Exploitation via external inputs (if applicable).
    *   Impact on application data and functionality.
    *   Review of the library's source code (Objective-C).
    *   Analysis of common usage patterns in applications.
*   **Exclusions:**
    *   Attacks that rely on physical access to the device.
    *   Attacks that require pre-existing malware on the device (unless the malware leverages a vulnerability in `MMDrawerController`).
    *   Social engineering attacks.
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks *unless* they directly contribute to unauthorized drawer manipulation.

**1.3 Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Static Code Analysis:**  We will meticulously examine the `MMDrawerController` source code (Objective-C) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This includes:
    *   Searching for publicly exposed methods or properties related to drawer state (open/close).
    *   Analyzing access control checks (or lack thereof) within these methods.
    *   Identifying potential injection points (e.g., URL schemes, external inputs).
    *   Looking for logic errors that could lead to unintended state changes.
    *   Checking for insecure use of notifications or delegates.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual, as we don't have a running app):**  We will conceptually outline how dynamic analysis *would* be performed if we had a test application. This includes:
    *   Describing how to use debugging tools (e.g., Xcode's debugger, Instruments) to monitor method calls and property changes related to the drawer.
    *   Explaining how to intercept and modify network traffic (if relevant).
    *   Outlining how to test for injection vulnerabilities using crafted inputs.

3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker scenarios and motivations to understand how they might attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

4.  **Best Practices Review:** We will compare the library's implementation and recommended usage against established iOS security best practices.

5.  **Documentation Review:** We will examine the library's documentation for any security-related guidance or warnings.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2

**2.1 Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Techniques:**

Based on the `MMDrawerController`'s likely functionality and common iOS development patterns, here are the potential vulnerabilities and how an attacker might exploit them:

*   **2.1.1 Direct Method Invocation (Public API Abuse):**

    *   **Vulnerability:** The `MMDrawerController` likely exposes methods like `openDrawerSide:animated:completion:`, `closeDrawerAnimated:completion:`, `toggleDrawerSide:animated:completion:`, or similar.  If these methods are not properly protected, an attacker could potentially call them directly from outside the intended application logic.
    *   **Exploitation:**
        *   **URL Schemes:** If the application registers a custom URL scheme and uses it to interact with the `MMDrawerController`, an attacker could craft a malicious URL (e.g., `myapp://openDrawer`) and trick the user into opening it (e.g., via a phishing link, a malicious website, or another compromised app).  This could bypass any in-app access controls.
        *   **JavaScript Injection (if used in a hybrid app):** If the `MMDrawerController` is exposed to a `WKWebView` or `UIWebView`, an attacker could inject JavaScript code to call the drawer manipulation methods.  This could occur through a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web content.
        *   **Runtime Manipulation (Jailbroken Devices):** On a jailbroken device, an attacker could use tools like Cycript or Frida to directly call the `MMDrawerController` methods, bypassing all application-level security.
        *   **Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities:** If another third-party library used by the application has a vulnerability that allows arbitrary method invocation, it could be used to target the `MMDrawerController`.

*   **2.1.2 Property Manipulation:**

    *   **Vulnerability:** The `MMDrawerController` might expose properties that control the drawer's state (e.g., `openSide`, `drawerState`).  If these properties are not properly protected (e.g., using Key-Value Observing (KVO) with appropriate access control), an attacker might be able to modify them directly.
    *   **Exploitation:** Similar to method invocation, attackers could use URL schemes, JavaScript injection, runtime manipulation, or vulnerabilities in other libraries to modify these properties and force the drawer to open or close.

*   **2.1.3 Bypassing Access Control Mechanisms:**

    *   **Vulnerability:** The application might implement its own access control logic to determine when the drawer should be allowed to open or close.  However, this logic might be flawed or bypassable.  For example:
        *   **Incorrect State Checks:** The application might check the user's authentication status or role incorrectly, leading to unauthorized access.
        *   **Race Conditions:**  If the access control checks are not performed atomically, a race condition might exist where an attacker could manipulate the drawer's state between the check and the actual opening/closing operation.
        *   **Logic Errors:**  Simple programming errors in the access control logic could lead to unintended behavior.
    *   **Exploitation:** Attackers would exploit these flaws by carefully timing their actions or providing specific inputs that trigger the vulnerabilities.

*   **2.1.4 Insecure Use of Notifications or Delegates:**

    *   **Vulnerability:** The `MMDrawerController` might use notifications or delegates to communicate drawer state changes.  If these mechanisms are not properly secured, an attacker could potentially:
        *   **Spoof Notifications:** Send fake notifications to trick the application into thinking the drawer should be opened or closed.
        *   **Register Malicious Delegates:**  Register a delegate that intercepts drawer state changes and performs unauthorized actions.
    *   **Exploitation:** This would likely require runtime manipulation or a vulnerability in another part of the application that allows the attacker to interfere with the notification or delegate system.

**2.2 Impact Analysis:**

The impact of unauthorized drawer manipulation depends heavily on the content and functionality exposed within the drawer:

*   **Information Disclosure:** If the drawer contains sensitive information (e.g., user profiles, financial data, private messages), unauthorized opening could lead to a data breach.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the drawer provides access to administrative features or settings, unauthorized opening could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges within the application.
*   **Functionality Disruption:** Unauthorized opening or closing of the drawer could disrupt the user experience or interfere with the application's normal operation.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the application and its developers.

**2.3 Mitigation Strategies:**

Here are specific recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities:

*   **2.3.1 Secure API Design and Implementation:**

    *   **Minimize Public API Surface:**  Only expose the necessary methods and properties for external use.  Use internal or private access modifiers whenever possible.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement robust access control checks *within* the `MMDrawerController` methods themselves.  Do not rely solely on external application logic.  These checks should verify:
        *   The caller's identity and authorization.
        *   The current application state.
        *   Any relevant contextual information.
    *   **Validate Inputs:**  Thoroughly validate any inputs passed to the drawer manipulation methods, even if they originate from within the application.  This helps prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Avoid Direct Property Access:**  Encapsulate drawer state management within the `MMDrawerController` and provide controlled methods for interacting with it.  Avoid exposing properties that directly control the drawer's state.

*   **2.3.2 Secure URL Scheme Handling (if applicable):**

    *   **Strict URL Validation:** If using URL schemes, implement very strict validation of the incoming URL.  Only allow specific, expected commands and parameters.  Reject any unexpected or malformed URLs.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Require authentication and authorization *before* processing any URL scheme requests that affect the drawer's state.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:**  Explore alternatives to URL schemes for inter-app communication, such as Universal Links, which are more secure.

*   **2.3.3 Secure WebView Integration (if applicable):**

    *   **Disable JavaScript Bridge (if possible):** If the `MMDrawerController` does not need to interact with JavaScript, disable the JavaScript bridge entirely.
    *   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which JavaScript can be loaded and executed.
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize any data passed between the native code and the WebView to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   **Use WKWebView:** Prefer `WKWebView` over `UIWebView` as it offers better security features.

*   **2.3.4 Secure Notification and Delegate Handling:**

    *   **Sender Verification:**  When receiving notifications, verify the sender's identity to prevent spoofing.
    *   **Secure Delegate Registration:**  Carefully control which objects can register as delegates for the `MMDrawerController`.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:**  Explore alternatives to notifications and delegates, such as using a centralized state management system.

*   **2.3.5 Runtime Security:**

    *   **Jailbreak Detection:** Implement jailbreak detection mechanisms to prevent the application from running on compromised devices (or to limit its functionality).  Note that jailbreak detection is an arms race and can often be bypassed.
    *   **Code Obfuscation:**  Obfuscate the application code to make it more difficult for attackers to reverse engineer and understand.
    *   **Anti-Debugging Techniques:**  Implement anti-debugging techniques to make it harder for attackers to use debugging tools.

*   **2.3.6 Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

    *   Conduct regular security audits of the application code, including the `MMDrawerController` integration.
    *   Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

*   **2.3.7  Dependency Management:**
    *   Keep `MMDrawerController` and all other dependencies up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Use a dependency management tool (e.g., CocoaPods, Carthage) to manage dependencies and track their versions.

**2.4  Detection Difficulty:**

Detecting unauthorized drawer manipulation can be challenging, especially if the attacker is sophisticated.  Here's why:

*   **Subtle Attacks:**  The attacker might only open the drawer briefly to access sensitive information, making it difficult to detect in real-time.
*   **Lack of Logging:**  If the application does not log drawer open/close events, it will be difficult to identify unauthorized activity.
*   **Bypass of Security Mechanisms:**  A skilled attacker might be able to bypass the application's security mechanisms, making detection even harder.

**2.5 Detection Strategies:**

*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Implement detailed logging of all drawer open/close events, including:
    *   Timestamp
    *   User ID (if applicable)
    *   Source of the request (e.g., URL scheme, internal method call)
    *   Success/failure status
    *   Any relevant contextual information
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual drawer activity patterns.  For example, if a user typically opens the drawer only a few times a day, a sudden spike in activity could indicate an attack.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate the application's logs with a SIEM system to centralize security monitoring and analysis.
*   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  Consider using RASP technology to detect and prevent attacks in real-time.
