# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is an open-source iOS library, specifically a `mmdrawercontroller`, designed to implement drawer-based navigation in iOS applications. The primary business goal for the maintainers of this open-source project is likely to provide a reusable, well-engineered, and easily integrable component that simplifies the development of user interfaces with drawer navigation patterns for iOS developers. Success is measured by developer adoption, community contributions, and positive feedback.

Business Priorities:
- Ease of integration and use for iOS developers.
- Stability and reliability of the library.
- Performance and responsiveness of the drawer navigation.
- Compatibility with different iOS versions and devices.
- Active community support and maintenance.

Business Risks:
- Low developer adoption if the library is not well-documented, has bugs, or is difficult to use.
- Lack of community contributions and maintenance leading to stagnation and obsolescence.
- Security vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited in applications using it, damaging reputation and trust.
- Compatibility issues with new iOS versions or devices, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates.
- Competition from alternative drawer navigation libraries or native iOS features.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Reliance on GitHub's infrastructure security for repository hosting and access control. Implemented: GitHub platform.
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, formal security audits or penetration testing are unlikely to be performed regularly unless driven by community or specific users.
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities might be discovered and reported by the community, but there is no guaranteed SLA for vulnerability response and patching.
- accepted risk: Dependency on the security of the build and distribution processes, which are likely basic for an open-source library.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) as part of the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (if any, though unlikely for a UI library like this).
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Encourage and facilitate community security reviews and contributions.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using the library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a UI library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using the library.
- Input Validation: The library should handle input parameters safely to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. While it's a UI component, it might receive configuration data. Input validation should be implemented where applicable to ensure data integrity and prevent injection vulnerabilities (though unlikely in this type of library).
- Cryptography: Not expected to be a core requirement for a UI library like `mmdrawercontroller`. If the library were to handle or store any sensitive data (which is not its intended purpose), then appropriate cryptography would be necessary. For this library, cryptography is not a primary security requirement.
- Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC): Follow secure coding practices during development, including code reviews, unit testing, and integration testing to minimize vulnerabilities.
- Dependency Management: If the library depends on external libraries (unlikely for a UI component like this), ensure these dependencies are securely managed and regularly updated to address known vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:
- For the `mmdrawercontroller` library itself, the critical process is maintaining the integrity and availability of the library for iOS developers. This includes the source code, build process, and distribution channels.
- For applications using the library, the critical business processes are application functionality and user experience, which could be impacted by vulnerabilities in the library.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
- Source code of the `mmdrawercontroller` library: High sensitivity. It represents the intellectual property and the core asset of the project. Unauthorized access or modification could lead to malicious versions or compromise the project's integrity.
- Build artifacts (library package): Medium sensitivity. Integrity is important to ensure developers are using a safe and unmodified version of the library.
- Security vulnerability reports: Medium sensitivity. Should be accessed by authorized developers to remediate vulnerabilities but should not be publicly disclosed prematurely.
