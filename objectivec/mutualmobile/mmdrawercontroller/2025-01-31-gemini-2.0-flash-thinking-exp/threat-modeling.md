# Threat Model Analysis for mutualmobile/mmdrawercontroller

## Threat: [Unauthorized Drawer Opening](./threats/unauthorized_drawer_opening.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic that controls drawer visibility. By manipulating user input or application state, they could bypass intended restrictions and programmatically force open a drawer using `mmdrawercontroller`'s methods (e.g., `openDrawerSide:animated:completion:`).
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information or functionality contained within the drawer to unauthorized users. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or privilege escalation depending on the drawer's content and the application's security model.
*   **Affected Component:** `mmdrawercontroller`'s `openDrawerSide:animated:completion:` method, Application's Drawer Visibility Logic, Gesture Handling (if bypassable).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust access control checks *before* calling `mmdrawercontroller` methods to open drawers.
    *   Thoroughly validate user roles, permissions, and application state before allowing drawer opening.
    *   Conduct rigorous testing of drawer opening logic under various conditions and user roles to identify bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   For sensitive contexts, prioritize programmatic drawer control over relying solely on gesture recognition, allowing for more precise access control enforcement.
    *   Regularly audit and review drawer visibility logic for potential security flaws.

## Threat: [Unprotected Sensitive Data in Drawer Views](./threats/unprotected_sensitive_data_in_drawer_views.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might mistakenly place sensitive data directly into the views that constitute the drawer's content. This could include hardcoded API keys, user credentials, or other private information. If an attacker successfully gains unauthorized access to the drawer (through the "Unauthorized Drawer Opening" threat or other application vulnerabilities), this sensitive data becomes directly exposed. Furthermore, static embedding of sensitive data in view hierarchies can make it vulnerable to memory dumps or debugging tools.
*   **Impact:** Direct and immediate exposure of sensitive data. This can lead to severe consequences such as account compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access to backend systems, and further exploitation using exposed credentials or API keys.
*   **Affected Component:** Application's Drawer Content Views, Data Handling within Drawer Views, potentially `mmdrawercontroller`'s view management if it indirectly facilitates access to these views.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Absolutely avoid hardcoding or directly embedding sensitive data within drawer views or any part of the application's UI code.
    *   Retrieve sensitive data dynamically and only when the drawer is authorized to be opened and visible, minimizing the window of exposure.
    *   Implement strong data masking or obfuscation techniques for any sensitive information that must be displayed within drawers.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data if it needs to be temporarily stored in memory for drawer display purposes.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews and security scans to proactively identify and eliminate any instances of inadvertently embedded sensitive data in drawer views or related code.
