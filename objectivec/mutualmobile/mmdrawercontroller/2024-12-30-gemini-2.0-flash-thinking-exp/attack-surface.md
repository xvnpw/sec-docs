Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving `MMDrawerController` and with "High" or "Critical" risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Forced Drawer Opening
    *   **Description:** An attacker can programmatically trigger the drawer to open unexpectedly, revealing sensitive information or functionality within the drawer.
    *   **How MMDrawerController Contributes:** `MMDrawerController` provides methods to programmatically open and close drawers (`openDrawerWithSide:animated:completion:`, `closeDrawerAnimated:completion:`). If access to these methods isn't properly controlled, or if the application logic doesn't anticipate unexpected calls, an attacker could exploit this.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in another part of the application allows an attacker to execute code that calls `openDrawerWithSide:animated:completion:` at an inappropriate time, such as during a secure transaction, revealing sensitive account details displayed in the drawer.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized access to features, potential for social engineering attacks by displaying unexpected content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks before programmatically opening drawers. Ensure only authorized parts of the application can trigger drawer opening.
        *   Review all code paths that can trigger drawer opening and ensure they are secure.
        *   Consider if there are scenarios where programmatic opening should be restricted or require additional confirmation.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unintended Side Effects from Drawer Actions
    *   **Description:** Actions performed within the drawer view controllers inadvertently trigger unintended or insecure actions in the main content view controller due to poorly managed communication or state updates facilitated by `MMDrawerController`.
    *   **How MMDrawerController Contributes:** `MMDrawerController` facilitates the interaction between the drawer and main content. If the communication mechanisms (e.g., delegation, notifications, shared data models) are not carefully implemented, actions in the drawer can have unexpected and potentially harmful consequences in the main content.
    *   **Example:** A button in the drawer is intended to change a user setting. However, due to a flaw in the communication logic between the drawer and main content (potentially through a delegate method or notification triggered by `MMDrawerController`'s state changes), it also triggers a purchase flow in the main content without proper user confirmation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, unexpected application behavior, potential financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Clearly define and document the communication pathways between the drawer and main content.
        *   Implement robust validation and authorization checks for actions triggered from the drawer that affect the main content.
        *   Thoroughly test the interactions between the drawer and main content to identify and prevent unintended side effects. Use principle of least privilege when granting permissions for drawer actions.
