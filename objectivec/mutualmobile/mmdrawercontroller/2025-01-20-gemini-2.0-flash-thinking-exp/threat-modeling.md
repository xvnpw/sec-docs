# Threat Model Analysis for mutualmobile/mmdrawercontroller

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Dynamic Drawer Content Leading to Injection Attacks](./threats/insecure_handling_of_dynamic_drawer_content_leading_to_injection_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code (e.g., HTML, JavaScript) into the drawer's view if the application dynamically loads content from untrusted sources without proper sanitization. This could occur if the drawer fetches data and renders it without encoding, leveraging the rendering capabilities of views managed by `mmdrawercontroller`. The attacker could then execute arbitrary scripts within the application's context.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Affected Component:** Drawer View Controller, specifically the methods used to load and render dynamic content within the drawer's view hierarchy managed by `mmdrawercontroller`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and output encoding for all dynamic content displayed in the drawer.
*   Use secure methods for fetching data (HTTPS).
*   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the drawer can load resources.
*   Avoid using `UIWebView` if possible, as `WKWebView` offers better security features.

## Threat: [Bypassing Authentication/Authorization via Drawer Navigation](./threats/bypassing_authenticationauthorization_via_drawer_navigation.md)

**Description:** An attacker might be able to bypass authentication or authorization checks by navigating to restricted areas of the application through links or buttons present in the drawer. This could happen if the drawer, managed by `mmdrawercontroller`, provides shortcuts to sections that should only be accessible after proper authentication, and the application doesn't re-validate access upon navigation from the drawer.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to restricted application features and data.

**Affected Component:**  Navigation elements within the Drawer View Controller managed by `mmdrawercontroller` (e.g., `UITableView`, `UICollectionView`, `UIButton` actions) and the application's navigation logic triggered from the drawer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks for all navigation options accessible through the drawer.
*   Ensure that the drawer's navigation respects the application's security policies and doesn't bypass existing access controls.
*   Re-validate user authentication before allowing access to sensitive sections navigated through the drawer.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the `mmdrawercontroller` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the__mmdrawercontroller__library_itself.md)

**Description:** The `mmdrawercontroller` library might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of the library. This could involve memory corruption issues, logic flaws within the library's core functionality for managing view controller transitions and drawer states, or other security weaknesses.

**Impact:**  Application crash, unexpected behavior, potential for remote code execution (depending on the nature of the vulnerability within `mmdrawercontroller`).

**Affected Component:**  All core components of the `mmdrawercontroller` library responsible for managing the drawer's state, transitions, and view hierarchy.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the `mmdrawercontroller` library to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Monitor the library's repository and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using dependency management tools to track and update library versions.
