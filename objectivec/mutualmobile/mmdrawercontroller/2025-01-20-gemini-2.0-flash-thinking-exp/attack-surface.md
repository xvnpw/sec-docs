# Attack Surface Analysis for mutualmobile/mmdrawercontroller

## Attack Surface: [State Manipulation and Race Conditions](./attack_surfaces/state_manipulation_and_race_conditions.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of the drawer's open/closed state, leading to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior when the state changes rapidly or concurrently.
    * **How mmdrawercontroller Contributes:** The library manages the internal state of the drawer and provides methods to open and close it. If the application logic interacts with this state without proper synchronization, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** Imagine an application that disables a button when the drawer is open. If an attacker can rapidly toggle the drawer state using the library's methods, they might be able to interact with the button during a brief window where the state is inconsistent, bypassing the intended restriction.
    * **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks, unexpected application behavior, potential data corruption if actions are triggered based on incorrect state assumptions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement proper state management using synchronization primitives.
        * Debounce or throttle state-dependent actions.
        * Thoroughly test state transitions, including rapid toggling.

## Attack Surface: [Content Injection via Drawer](./attack_surfaces/content_injection_via_drawer.md)

* **Description:**  Injection of malicious content (e.g., scripts, HTML) into the drawer's view, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) like attacks or other malicious behavior.
    * **How mmdrawercontroller Contributes:** The library provides a container to display content in the drawer. If the application dynamically loads content into this container without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An application fetches user-generated content to display in the navigation drawer. If this content isn't sanitized before being placed in the drawer's view (managed by `mmdrawercontroller`), an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that executes when the drawer is opened.
    * **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, information disclosure, session hijacking, malicious actions performed within the application context.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize all dynamically loaded content before displaying it in the drawer.
        * Use appropriate content rendering techniques to prevent script execution.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) if using web views within the drawer.
