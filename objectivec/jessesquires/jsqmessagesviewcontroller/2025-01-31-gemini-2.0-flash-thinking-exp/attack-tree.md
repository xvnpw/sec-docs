## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Malicious Message Injection (Critical Node & High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_malicious_message_injection__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting crafted messages to trigger vulnerabilities in message processing or rendering.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This is a broad category encompassing several specific attacks, many of which are relatively easy to execute and can have significant impact. Input from messages is inherently user-controlled and thus a prime target for attackers.

    *   **1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - like Injection (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Step:** Injecting malicious code (HTML, JavaScript-like) or URLs within messages.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depending on input sanitization).
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Information Disclosure, UI Manipulation, Phishing).
        *   **Effort:** Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires robust input validation and security testing).
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Strict input sanitization of all message content.
            *   Escaping or removing potentially harmful HTML, JavaScript, and active content.
            *   URL validation and sanitization.
            *   Content Security Policy (CSP) if WebView is used.

        *   **1.1.2. Inject Malicious URLs/Links (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)**
            *   **Attack Step:** Embedding malicious URLs within messages to redirect users to phishing sites or malware.
            *   **Likelihood:** High.
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Phishing, Malware Download, Credential Theft).
            *   **Effort:** Low.
            *   **Skill Level:** Low.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (for malicious URLs themselves, harder for intent).
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   Robust URL validation and sanitization.
                *   URL reputation checks.
                *   User education about suspicious links.

        *   **Impact:** High (Application Freeze, DoS).
        *   **Effort:** Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (application freeze is easily noticeable).
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Robust rendering logic in JSQMessagesViewController.
            *   Thorough testing of rendering with various message types and edge cases.
