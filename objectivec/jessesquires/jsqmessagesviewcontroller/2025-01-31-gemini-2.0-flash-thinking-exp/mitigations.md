## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Output Encoding for Message Text within `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` Display](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_output_encoding_for_message_text_within__jsqmessagesviewcontroller__display.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Server-Side Sanitization (Backend Prerequisite):** While not directly in `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`, ensure the backend sanitizes message text *before* it reaches the client and is displayed by `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`. This is a crucial prerequisite.
        *   The backend should use a robust sanitization library to process message text, removing or encoding potentially harmful HTML, JavaScript, or format string characters.
        *   The sanitized text is then sent to the client application.
    2.  **Verify Client-Side Output Encoding in `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`:**  Confirm that `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` and the underlying iOS components it uses for text rendering (e.g., `UITextView`, `UILabel`) automatically handle output encoding to prevent interpretation of special characters as code when displaying messages.
        *   Test displaying messages with various special characters, HTML-like tags, and potential script injection attempts within `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` to observe how they are rendered.
        *   If `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`'s default behavior is insufficient, explore customization options or consider using attributed strings with proper encoding when setting message text.
    3.  **Limit Formatting Options in `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` Input:** Configure the input components used with `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` to restrict or disable rich text formatting if not strictly necessary.
        *   If plain text messages are sufficient, ensure the input field associated with `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` only accepts plain text.
        *   If limited formatting is needed, carefully control the allowed formatting options and ensure both client-side input and server-side sanitization handle these options securely.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within the Chat UI (High Severity): Malicious scripts injected into messages could be executed within the context of the chat view rendered by `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`, potentially leading to data theft or UI manipulation.
        *   UI Manipulation/Spoofing within the Chat UI (Medium Severity): Malicious formatting or characters could alter the intended display of messages within `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`, potentially misleading users.
        *   Format String Vulnerabilities (Low to Medium Severity, in specific contexts): If message text is processed in a way that interprets format strings *after* being retrieved by `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` (less likely but possible in custom integrations), unsanitized input could cause issues.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS Mitigation: High Reduction - Prevents XSS attacks originating from message content displayed by `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`.
        *   UI Manipulation Mitigation: Medium Reduction - Reduces UI manipulation risks within the chat view.
        *   Format String Mitigation: Medium Reduction - Mitigates format string vulnerabilities related to message content displayed in `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Server-Side Sanitization (Backend Prerequisite): Partially implemented in the backend.
        *   Client-Side Output Encoding in `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`: Assumed to be handled by default. Needs explicit verification within the iOS app and `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` usage.
        *   Limit Formatting Options in `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` Input: Not implemented in the client-side UI associated with `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Client-Side Output Encoding in `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`:  Requires testing and explicit verification within the iOS application using `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`. Potentially needs code to enhance encoding if default behavior is insufficient.
        *   Limit Formatting Options in `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` Input: Needs implementation in the client-side UI components used for message input in conjunction with `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Media Messages Displayed by `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_media_messages_displayed_by__jsqmessagesviewcontroller_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Server-Side Media Validation (Backend Prerequisite):** Ensure the backend validates media files *before* they are sent to the client and displayed by `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`.
        *   The backend should perform file type validation, size limits, and potentially content scanning on uploaded media.
        *   Re-encoding media on the server can also help sanitize it before it's served to the client.
    2.  **Client-Side Media Display Security within `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`:** Ensure that `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` uses secure and up-to-date iOS components for displaying media (images, videos, audio).
        *   Verify that `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` utilizes standard iOS components like `UIImageView` and `AVPlayerViewController` for media display.
        *   Keep the iOS SDK updated to benefit from the latest security patches for media handling within these components.
        *   Be aware of any reported vulnerabilities related to media handling in iOS versions supported by your application and ensure compatibility and mitigations are in place.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
