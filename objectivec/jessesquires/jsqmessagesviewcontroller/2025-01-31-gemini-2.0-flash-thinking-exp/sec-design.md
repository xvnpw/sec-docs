# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The primary goal of the JSQMessagesViewController library is to provide iOS developers with a reusable and customizable user interface component for creating chat applications.
  - Key priorities include:
    - Ease of integration and use for developers.
    - Feature richness, offering a wide range of chat functionalities.
    - Customizability to allow developers to tailor the UI to their application's design.
    - Performance and efficiency to ensure a smooth user experience in chat applications.
    - Community support and active maintenance to address issues and incorporate new features.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities within the library could be exploited by malicious actors in applications that integrate it, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
  - Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates could result in the library becoming outdated, incompatible with newer iOS versions, or vulnerable to newly discovered security threats.
  - Performance issues or bugs in the library could negatively impact the user experience of applications that depend on it, potentially leading to user dissatisfaction and application abandonment.
  - If the library is difficult to use or lacks necessary features, developers may choose alternative solutions, reducing the library's adoption and value.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The library is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase, which can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY.
  - security control: Standard iOS Security Mechanisms - The library operates within the iOS ecosystem and benefits from the underlying security features provided by the iOS platform, such as sandboxing and memory protection. Implemented: IOS PLATFORM.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - As a software library, JSQMessagesViewController may depend on other third-party libraries or frameworks, which could introduce vulnerabilities. Managing these dependencies and keeping them updated is an ongoing effort.
  - accepted risk: Misuse by Developers - Developers integrating the library into their applications may not always use it securely, potentially introducing vulnerabilities in their own application logic or data handling.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated static and dynamic analysis security scanning tools in the development pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the library code.
  - recommended security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing by security experts to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - recommended security control: Secure Development Practices - Adhere to secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle, including input validation, output encoding, and secure data handling.
  - recommended security control: Dependency Management - Implement a robust dependency management process to track and update third-party libraries, ensuring timely patching of known vulnerabilities.
  - recommended security control: Security Guidelines for Developers - Provide clear and comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for developers using the library to integrate it securely into their applications.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Authentication is not directly handled by the JSQMessagesViewController library itself. Authentication of users is the responsibility of the application that integrates the library.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Authorization, determining what actions a user is permitted to perform within the chat application (e.g., sending messages, deleting messages, accessing certain channels), is the responsibility of the integrating application, not the library.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library must implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS) through user-provided message content. This includes validating and sanitizing message text, media file names, and any other user inputs displayed by the library.
    - Implemented: Within the library's message rendering and display logic.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Cryptographic functionalities for message encryption (end-to-end or in transit) are not inherently provided by the JSQMessagesViewController library. If encryption is required, it must be implemented by the integrating application, potentially using iOS security frameworks and libraries.
    - Requirement: If the library handles any sensitive data locally (e.g., caching messages), this data should be encrypted at rest using appropriate iOS data protection mechanisms.
