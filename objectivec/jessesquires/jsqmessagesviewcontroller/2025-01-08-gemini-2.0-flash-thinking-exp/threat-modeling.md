# Threat Model Analysis for jessesquires/jsqmessagesviewcontroller

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Messages Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/maliciously_crafted_messages_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted message with unusual formatting, excessively long strings, or unexpected characters. The `JSQMessagesViewController`'s rendering or parsing logic fails to handle this input gracefully, leading to UI freezes, crashes, or excessive resource consumption on the device.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, disrupting the user experience and potentially leading to data loss if the application doesn't save state correctly.

**Affected Component:** `JSQMessagesViewController`'s message rendering logic, specifically the code responsible for parsing and displaying message content within `collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the message content *before* passing it to the `JSQMessagesViewController`.
* Set reasonable limits on the length of messages that can be displayed.
* Consider using asynchronous processing for message rendering to prevent blocking the main UI thread.
* Test the application with a wide range of potentially malformed message inputs.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Improper Message Rendering](./threats/information_disclosure_through_improper_message_rendering.md)

**Description:** The `JSQMessagesViewController` might not properly sanitize or escape message content before displaying it. An attacker could embed malicious code or markup (though less likely in a native context compared to web) within a message that, when rendered, reveals unintended information or alters the UI in a misleading way.

**Impact:** Sensitive information within the message might be displayed incorrectly or exposed. In a theoretical scenario (less likely in native), malicious scripts could be injected if the rendering logic is flawed, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Affected Component:** `JSQMessagesViewController`'s message bubble rendering logic, specifically the methods responsible for displaying text and other content within the message bubbles (e.g., within custom cell implementations or default rendering).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the library, or any custom rendering code, properly escapes or sanitizes message content before display.
* Avoid directly rendering HTML or other potentially executable content within message bubbles without strict sanitization.
* Regularly review the library's updates for any security patches related to rendering vulnerabilities.
