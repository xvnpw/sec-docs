# Attack Surface Analysis for jessesquires/jsqmessagesviewcontroller

## Attack Surface: [Message Content Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS within the App)](./attack_surfaces/message_content_injection__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_within_the_app_.md)

- **Description:** Malicious HTML or JavaScript code is injected into messages, which is then executed by the application's rendering engine.
- **How JSQMessagesViewController Contributes:** The library renders the provided message content. If the application doesn't sanitize this content before passing it to the library, it will render the malicious code.
- **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS!')</script>`. When this message is displayed using `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`, the JavaScript code will execute within the application's context.
- **Impact:** Stealing user data, performing actions on behalf of the user, manipulating the UI, session hijacking.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developer:** Implement strict input sanitization and output encoding of all user-provided message content *before* passing it to `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML escaping for text).
    - **Developer:** Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Media Handling (Images, Videos, Audio)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_media_handling__images__videos__audio_.md)

- **Description:**  Specially crafted media files are sent that exploit vulnerabilities in media decoding libraries or lead to the execution of malicious code.
- **How JSQMessagesViewController Contributes:** The library handles the display of media content. If the application doesn't validate the source and type of media, or if the underlying media handling libraries have vulnerabilities, it can be exploited.
- **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted PNG image that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the image decoding library used by the application, potentially leading to a crash or remote code execution.
- **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential remote code execution.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developer:** Validate the source and type of media files rigorously. Download media from trusted sources only.
    - **Developer:** Utilize secure and up-to-date media processing libraries.
    - **Developer:** Consider sandboxing the media decoding process to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    - **User:** Be cautious about opening media from unknown or untrusted sources.
