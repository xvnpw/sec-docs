# Attack Surface Analysis for jessesquires/jsqmessagesviewcontroller

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Message Content Injection (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_message_content_injection__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** The library renders user-provided message content. If the application doesn't sanitize this content before passing it to the library, attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript.
*   **How jsqmessagesviewcontroller Contributes:** The library's primary function is to display message content, making it the rendering engine for potentially malicious input.
*   **Example:** A user sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If the application doesn't sanitize this, the library will render it, and the JavaScript will execute within the application's context.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript can lead to session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, or UI manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side *before* passing message content to `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`. This includes escaping HTML entities, validating URLs, and filtering potentially malicious characters.
    *   Consider using a content security policy (CSP) if the application uses web views in conjunction with the messaging feature.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Attachment Handling](./attack_surfaces/malicious_attachment_handling.md)

*   **Description:** If the library handles attachments (images, videos, files), vulnerabilities can arise from processing malicious file types or large files.
*   **How jsqmessagesviewcontroller Contributes:** The library provides mechanisms for displaying and potentially interacting with attachments.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a message with a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image decoding library used by the application or the operating system.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation of attachment file types on the server-side and client-side before processing them with the library.
    *   Use secure and up-to-date libraries for handling different attachment types.
    *   Implement size limits for attachments to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Consider sandboxing the attachment viewing process to limit the impact of potential exploits.
