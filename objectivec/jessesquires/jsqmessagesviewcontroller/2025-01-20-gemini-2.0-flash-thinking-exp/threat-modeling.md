# Threat Model Analysis for jessesquires/jsqmessagesviewcontroller

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Message Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_message_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML or JavaScript code into a message. When the application renders this message using `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`, the malicious script executes within the user's context. This is a direct consequence of how the library renders text-based messages without inherent sanitization.

**Impact:** The attacker could steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, deface the chat interface, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Message Bubbles](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_message_bubbles.md)

**Description:** The application displays sensitive information directly within the message bubbles rendered by `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` without proper masking or encryption. This vulnerability lies in the library's function of displaying provided content directly.

**Impact:** Confidential information is exposed, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or other security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Message Content](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_message_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send specially crafted messages with excessively long text or complex HTML/JavaScript (if XSS is possible) that could cause the application to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) *during the rendering process* within `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, crashes, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [UI Freezing due to Rendering Issues](./threats/ui_freezing_due_to_rendering_issues.md)

**Description:** Specific combinations of message types, custom cell configurations, or a large number of messages could potentially cause rendering issues *within `jsqmessagesviewcontroller`*, leading to UI freezes or unresponsiveness. This directly relates to the library's rendering logic.

**Impact:** Poor user experience, application unresponsiveness, potentially leading to the user abandoning the application.

**Risk Severity:** High
