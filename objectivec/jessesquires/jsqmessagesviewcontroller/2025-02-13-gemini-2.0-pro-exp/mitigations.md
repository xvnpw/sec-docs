## Mitigation Strategy: [Message Content Sanitization and Encoding (Client-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/message_content_sanitization_and_encoding__client-side_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize and encode all message content *before* passing it to `JSQMessagesViewController`.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Client-Side Sanitization:** *Before* passing the message text to `JSQMessagesViewController` (e.g., in your data model or component that interacts with the library), use a client-side HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify) to remove all potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes. This is crucial as a defense-in-depth measure, even if you have server-side sanitization.
    2.  **Encoding:** After sanitization, ensure that any remaining text is properly HTML-encoded. This prevents characters like `<` and `>` from being interpreted as HTML tags. Use your framework's built-in encoding functions (e.g., in React, text within JSX is automatically encoded).  This is particularly important if you are constructing HTML strings manually.
    3.  **Custom Cell Handling:** If you have *custom cell renderers*, apply steps 1 and 2 *within* the custom cell rendering logic. This is absolutely *critical*.  Any custom rendering bypasses the library's built-in (potentially inadequate) protections.  You are responsible for the security of your custom cells.
    4.  **URL Handling (Within Messages):**
        *   Use a dedicated URL parsing library to identify URLs within the message text *before* passing the message to the view controller.
        *   Validate that the URLs are well-formed and use allowed schemes (e.g., `https://`).
        *   *Do not* automatically convert any text that *looks* like a URL into a clickable link. Explicitly create links using the validated URL *within your message rendering logic*.
        *   Consider displaying a clear warning to the user before they open any link (this can be done via a custom cell or a tap handler).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Prevents the execution of malicious scripts embedded in message content.
    *   **HTML Injection:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary HTML to alter the appearance or behavior of the messaging UI.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk, acting as a crucial client-side defense.
    *   **HTML Injection:** Eliminates the risk if sanitization is properly implemented within your message handling and custom cell rendering.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Client-side sanitization is implemented using DOMPurify before displaying messages. URL handling is basic (automatic linking of anything that looks like a URL). Custom cells are used for image messages. (Location: `client/components/MessageView.js`, `client/components/ImageMessageCell.js`)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   URL handling needs to be significantly improved to use proper validation and *not* automatically create links.
    *   `ImageMessageCell.js` (the custom cell) needs a thorough audit to ensure it performs sanitization and encoding of any data it displays.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Media Handling (Within `JSQMessagesViewController`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_media_handling__within__jsqmessagesviewcontroller__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement secure handling for all media displayed *within* `JSQMessagesViewController`.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Validate Media URLs:** Before loading any media *within the context of `JSQMessagesViewController`*, validate the URL to ensure it points to a trusted source and uses a secure protocol (e.g., `https://`). This validation should happen *before* you pass the media data to the library.
    2.  **Custom Viewers:** If you're using *custom views* to display media (instead of the built-in `JSQMessagesViewController` mechanisms), you are *fully responsible* for the security of those views. Apply all relevant security best practices to your custom code:
        *   Use secure image and video loading libraries within your custom viewer.
        *   Avoid executing any code based on the content of media files.
        *   Sanitize and encode any data displayed alongside the media.
    3. **Delegate Methods:** If you are using `JSQMessagesViewController` delegate methods related to media handling (e.g., methods for loading or displaying media), carefully validate and sanitize any data passed to these methods *before* using it. Do *not* assume the data is safe.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents XSS vulnerabilities that might be exploited through malicious media files or URLs, particularly within custom viewers.
    *   **Content Injection:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious media content.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Reduces the risk, especially if custom viewers are properly secured.
    *   **Content Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Basic image loading is used within a custom cell, relying on the browser's built-in image handling. No specific validation of media URLs before passing them to the custom cell. (Location: `client/components/ImageMessageCell.js`)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   Need to validate media URLs *before* passing them to the custom `ImageMessageCell`.
    *   `ImageMessageCell.js` needs a thorough security review to ensure it handles media loading securely.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Validation in Delegate Methods](./mitigation_strategies/data_validation_in_delegate_methods.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully validate and sanitize data in `JSQMessagesViewController` delegate methods.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Delegate Methods:** Identify all `JSQMessagesViewController` delegate methods used in your application.
    2.  **Input Validation:** Within each delegate method, carefully validate and sanitize *any* data received from `JSQMessagesViewController` *before* using it. This includes message content, user information, media data, and any other parameters passed to the delegate method. Do *not* assume that the data provided by the library is safe or has been previously validated.
    3. **Input Sanitization:** Use appropriate sanitization techniques based on the type of data. For text, use HTML sanitization (as described above). For URLs, use URL validation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents XSS if delegate methods are used to display or process potentially malicious data.
    *   **Data Tampering:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of attackers modifying data passed through delegate methods.
    * **Other Injection Attacks:** (Severity: Depends) Prevents other injection attacks if delegate methods are used to process potentially malicious data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Reduces the risk, particularly if delegate methods are used to handle user-provided data.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Reduces the risk.
    * **Other Injection Attacks:** Reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) No specific data validation is performed within delegate methods. (Location: `client/components/ChatViewController.js`)

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   Need to review all delegate methods in `ChatViewController.js` and implement appropriate data validation and sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Denial of Service (DoS) Protection (Related to UI)](./mitigation_strategies/denial_of_service__dos__protection__related_to_ui_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement measures to prevent DoS attacks that could impact the `JSQMessagesViewController` UI.

* **Description:**
    1.  **Message Size Limits (Client-Side):** Enforce limits on the maximum size of messages *before* sending them to `JSQMessagesViewController`. This prevents extremely large messages from overwhelming the UI.
    2.  **Pagination/Lazy Loading:** Avoid loading all messages at once into `JSQMessagesViewController`. Use pagination or lazy loading to load messages in chunks as the user scrolls. This is a crucial performance optimization that also mitigates DoS. This directly impacts how you interact with `JSQMessagesViewController`'s data source.
    3. **Input Validation:** Limit message length, restrict allowed characters in input field.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from overwhelming the `JSQMessagesViewController` UI with a flood of messages or large messages, causing it to become unresponsive.

* **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk.

* **Currently Implemented:** (Example) No message size limits on the client-side. All messages loaded at once. (Location: `client/components/MessageInput.js`, `client/components/MessageView.js`)

* **Missing Implementation:** (Example)
    *   Need to implement message size limits *before* sending data to `JSQMessagesViewController`.
    *   Need to implement pagination or lazy loading to avoid loading all messages at once into `JSQMessagesViewController`.
