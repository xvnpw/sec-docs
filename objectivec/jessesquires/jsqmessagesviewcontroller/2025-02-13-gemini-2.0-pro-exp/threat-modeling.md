# Threat Model Analysis for jessesquires/jsqmessagesviewcontroller

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Message Length](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_message_length.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a message with an extremely long text body, potentially containing millions of characters or deeply nested HTML (if HTML rendering is enabled). This overwhelms the library's text rendering and layout engine, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash.  This directly exploits the library's handling of text.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, rendering the messaging feature (and potentially the entire application) unusable.
*   **Affected Component:** The text rendering and layout components within `JSQMessagesViewController`, particularly those related to calculating cell sizes and displaying text. This includes the `attributedText` handling and any custom layout calculations in `collectionView(_:layout:sizeForItemAt:)`.  The core text display mechanism is at fault.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Limits:** Enforce strict message length limits on the server-side. Reject any messages exceeding this limit.
    *   **Client-Side Limits:** Implement client-side checks to prevent users from entering excessively long messages.
    *   **Truncation:** If long messages are unavoidable, implement intelligent truncation within the message view (using `JSQMessagesViewController`'s features), displaying only a preview and providing a "show more" option.
    *   **Asynchronous Rendering:** Explore asynchronous text rendering techniques (within the context of how `JSQMessagesViewController` allows customization) to prevent long messages from blocking the main UI thread.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_message_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a very large number of messages in a short period, overwhelming the library's ability to process and display them. This can lead to UI freezes, excessive memory consumption, and application crashes. This directly impacts the library's data source and display mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the messaging feature unusable.
*   **Affected Component:** The core data handling and display logic of `JSQMessagesViewController`, including the `collectionView` data source and delegate methods, and any internal caching mechanisms. The library's core message management is overwhelmed.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (Server-Side):** Implement robust rate limiting on the server-side to prevent users from sending messages too frequently.
    *   **Throttling (Client-Side):** Implement client-side throttling (within the constraints of `JSQMessagesViewController`'s API) to limit the rate at which messages are processed and displayed.
    *   **Pagination:** Load messages in batches (pagination), leveraging `JSQMessagesViewController`'s ability to handle data sources, rather than all at once.
    *   **Efficient Data Structures:** Use efficient data structures and algorithms for managing the message list, optimizing how data is fed to `JSQMessagesViewController`.

## Threat: [Malicious Attachment Handling (Image/Video/File)](./threats/malicious_attachment_handling__imagevideofile_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a message containing a malicious attachment (e.g., an image with an embedded exploit, a video with a crafted codec, or a disguised executable file).  If `JSQMessagesViewController` *directly* handles the rendering or processing of these attachments (e.g., through a built-in image viewer or media player), and that component is vulnerable, the attacker can exploit it.  *This threat is only relevant if JSQMessagesViewController or MessageKit has built-in, un-sandboxed handling of attachments. If the application uses separate, well-vetted libraries, this threat is mitigated at that level.*
*   **Impact:** Code execution, device compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions, depending on the nature of the exploit.
*   **Affected Component:** Any components *within* `JSQMessagesViewController` or its associated helper classes that *directly* handle attachments, including built-in image viewers, video players, or file download/display logic. This is particularly relevant to custom `media` message types and their associated view controllers *if those view controllers are part of the library itself*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation (Server-Side):** Implement strict file type validation *on the server-side*, using allow-listing.
    *   **File Size Limits (Server-Side):** Enforce strict file size limits.
    *   **Secure Media Libraries (If Applicable):** *If* `JSQMessagesViewController` uses internal libraries for media handling, ensure those are well-vetted and up-to-date.  If the application uses *external* libraries, this mitigation applies to *those* libraries, not directly to `JSQMessagesViewController`.
    *   **Sandboxing (If Applicable):** *If* `JSQMessagesViewController` provides any built-in attachment handling, investigate if it offers sandboxing or isolation. If not, and the application handles attachments directly, implement sandboxing at the application level.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict content types.
    *   **Virus Scanning (Server-Side):** Consider server-side virus scanning.
