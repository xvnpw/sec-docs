## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content.md)

*   **XSS via Message Text (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends a message containing malicious JavaScript code within the message text. If `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` or the backend fails to properly sanitize or escape this input before rendering it in the user interface, the code will execute in the context of other users' browsers.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (If proper server-side sanitization is in place) to High (If sanitization is weak or absent)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can lead to account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and the spread of malware.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Simple XSS payloads are easy to create; more complex payloads require more effort.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires analyzing network traffic for suspicious payloads and monitoring client-side behavior for unexpected script execution.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Server-Side Input Sanitization:** Use a well-vetted and up-to-date HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) on the *server* to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious code *before* storing or displaying the message. Client-side sanitization is insufficient.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, limiting the impact of successful XSS injections.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure that all message content is properly encoded (e.g., HTML entity encoding) when displayed in the UI, preventing the browser from interpreting malicious code as executable.
        *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Sanitize data differently depending on where it will be displayed (e.g., plain text, HTML attributes, JavaScript contexts).

*   **XSS via Media Attachments:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., an HTML file disguised as an image or a JavaScript file) as a media attachment. If the application or `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` doesn't properly validate the file type and content, the malicious file could be executed in the user's browser.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (If proper file type validation and content handling are in place)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Similar to XSS via message text)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires crafting a malicious file and bypassing file type checks)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires analyzing uploaded files and monitoring server-side and client-side behavior for suspicious activity.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Server-Side File Type Validation:** Do *not* rely on the file extension or client-provided MIME type. Use a library that analyzes the file's *content* to determine its true type.
        *   **Content-Type Header Control:** Serve all attachments with the correct `Content-Type` header. For untrusted content, use `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` and `Content-Disposition: attachment` to force the browser to download the file instead of rendering it.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Render attachments in a sandboxed environment (e.g., an `iframe` with the `sandbox` attribute) to limit their ability to interact with the main application.
        *   **Malware Scanning:** Implement server-side malware scanning for all uploaded attachments.

*   **XSS via JS API:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` library handles data passed through its JavaScript API. If the API doesn't properly sanitize or validate input, it could be used to inject malicious code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (If the API has proper input validation)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Similar to other XSS attacks)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires understanding the API and crafting a malicious payload)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires analyzing API calls and client-side behavior)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict API Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* data passed to the `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` API. Treat all API input as potentially untrusted.
        *   **Type Checking:** Use strong type checking (e.g., TypeScript) to help prevent passing invalid data to the API.
        *   **Documentation:** Clearly document the expected data types and formats for all API parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Bypass Input Validation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker bypasses client-side input validation (which is often present for user experience but not security) and directly interacts with the server-side API. This allows them to send crafted requests that might retrieve unauthorized data or inject malicious data that circumvents intended security controls.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (If server-side validation is weak or absent)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Could allow attackers to send malicious messages, access unauthorized data, or perform other unauthorized actions.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Can be achieved by using browser developer tools or scripting to directly interact with the server-side API.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring server-side API requests and comparing them to expected client-side behavior.  Anomalous requests or data access patterns should be flagged.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Robust Server-Side Validation:** *Always* perform comprehensive input validation on the *server-side*. Never rely solely on client-side validation for security. Validate all data received from the client, including message content, sender information, and any other parameters.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the server-side API only exposes the minimum necessary data and functionality to the client.

*   **Leak Message History:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the application or `jsqmessagesviewcontroller` loads, stores, or caches message history. This could allow them to access messages from other users, messages that should have been deleted, or messages outside of their authorized scope.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (If proper authorization and caching mechanisms are in place)
    *   **Impact:** High (Could expose private conversations and sensitive information)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires exploiting vulnerabilities in message loading or caching)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires analyzing message loading patterns, cache access, and server logs.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Strict Authorization Checks:** Implement robust authorization checks for *all* message loading requests. Ensure that users can only access messages they are authorized to see.
        *   **Secure Caching:** If caching is used, ensure that the cache is properly secured and that cached data is only accessible to authorized users. Implement appropriate cache invalidation mechanisms.
        *   **Data Retention Policies:** Implement and enforce data retention policies. Delete messages after a defined period to minimize the risk of data exposure.

*   **Access Message Content (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker gains direct access to the raw content of messages, potentially bypassing encryption or other security measures. This is the most severe data exfiltration scenario.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (If E2EE or strong server-side encryption is used)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Direct access to message content, potentially including highly sensitive information)
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High (Requires bypassing encryption, compromising the server, or exploiting significant vulnerabilities in the application's core logic.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Requires advanced intrusion detection capabilities, monitoring of data access patterns, and potentially forensic analysis.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** If message confidentiality is paramount, implement E2EE. This ensures that only the sender and recipient can decrypt the messages, protecting them even from the server.
        *   **Strong Server-Side Encryption (If E2EE is not feasible):** If messages are stored on the server, encrypt them at rest using strong encryption algorithms and securely manage the encryption keys.
        *   **Strict Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls to limit who can access the message storage and decryption keys.
        *   **Auditing:** Implement comprehensive auditing of all data access attempts.
