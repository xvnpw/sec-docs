* **Arbitrary Native Function Invocation from JavaScript:**
    * **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code within the WebView can call arbitrary native functions exposed through the bridge.
    * **How WebViewJavascriptBridge Contributes:** The bridge's core functionality is to allow JavaScript to trigger native code execution by sending messages with function names and arguments. If not properly controlled, this becomes a direct attack vector.
    * **Example:** A compromised website loaded in the WebView sends a message to the native side with a function name like `deleteUserAccount` and a user ID as an argument. If the native side doesn't validate the caller or the function name, it might execute this request.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially critical, leading to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, privilege escalation, or application compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Whitelisting of Native Functions:**  Only expose a predefined and limited set of native functions through the bridge.
        * **Authentication/Authorization on Native Side:** Verify the origin or identity of the JavaScript caller before executing sensitive native functions.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization on Native Side:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all parameters received from JavaScript before using them in native function calls.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only expose the necessary native functionality required by the web content.

* **Parameter Injection/Manipulation in Native Function Calls:**
    * **Description:** Malicious JavaScript can manipulate the parameters passed to native functions, leading to unintended consequences.
    * **How WebViewJavascriptBridge Contributes:** The bridge transmits parameters from JavaScript to native code. If the native side trusts these parameters without validation, it's vulnerable.
    * **Example:** A JavaScript function calls a native function to access a file, but the attacker manipulates the file path parameter to access a sensitive system file.
    * **Impact:** High, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized file access, or command injection if parameters are used in system calls.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation on Native Side:** Implement robust validation for all parameters received from JavaScript, checking data types, formats, and allowed values.
        * **Output Encoding/Escaping on Native Side:** If parameters are used in contexts like database queries or system commands, properly encode or escape them to prevent injection attacks.
        * **Use Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** When interacting with databases, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

* **JavaScript Injection from Native to WebView:**
    * **Description:** The native application sends data to the WebView via the bridge that is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
    * **How WebViewJavascriptBridge Contributes:** The bridge facilitates sending data from native code to JavaScript. If this data is treated as executable code by the WebView, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** The native side retrieves user-generated content from a server and sends it to the WebView to be displayed. If this content contains `<script>` tags or event handlers with malicious JavaScript, it will be executed in the WebView.
    * **Impact:** High, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, or redirect users to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Output Encoding/Escaping on Native Side:**  Before sending data to the WebView, properly encode or escape it based on the context where it will be used in JavaScript (e.g., HTML escaping for displaying content).
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the WebView can load resources and execute scripts, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        * **Avoid Directly Injecting HTML:** If possible, send data in a structured format (like JSON) and manipulate the DOM using JavaScript within the WebView, rather than directly injecting HTML strings.

* **Data Leakage from Native to JavaScript:**
    * **Description:** Sensitive data from the native application is inadvertently or intentionally exposed to the JavaScript environment through the bridge.
    * **How WebViewJavascriptBridge Contributes:** The bridge acts as a conduit for data transfer between native and JavaScript. If sensitive information is passed without careful consideration, it becomes accessible to potentially malicious scripts.
    * **Example:** The native side sends user authentication tokens or API keys to the JavaScript side for convenience, making them vulnerable if the WebView is compromised.
    * **Impact:** High, leading to the exposure of sensitive user data, credentials, or application secrets.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Minimize Data Transfer:** Only send the necessary data to the JavaScript side. Avoid passing sensitive information if it's not absolutely required.
        * **Secure Data Handling in JavaScript:** If sensitive data must be passed, ensure it's handled securely in JavaScript (e.g., not stored in easily accessible variables, cleared after use). However, the native side should be the primary protector of sensitive data.
        * **Consider Alternative Communication Methods:** For highly sensitive data, explore alternative communication methods that don't involve directly exposing it to the WebView.
