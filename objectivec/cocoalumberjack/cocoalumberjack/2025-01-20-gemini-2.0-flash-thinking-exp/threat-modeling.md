# Threat Model Analysis for cocoalumberjack/cocoalumberjack

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Exposure in Log Files](./threats/sensitive_information_exposure_in_log_files.md)

**Description:** CocoaLumberjack is configured to write logs to a destination (file, console, remote server) without adequate security measures. An attacker gains unauthorized access to these logs by exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage mechanism or network transport used by CocoaLumberjack's appenders (e.g., weak file permissions, unencrypted network connections). The attacker then reads the log files to extract sensitive information that was logged using CocoaLumberjack.

**Impact:** Data breach, identity theft, compromise of user accounts, exposure of confidential business information, compliance violations.

**Affected Component:** `DDFileLogger`, `DDASLLogger`, custom loggers, network loggers (if insecurely configured).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid logging sensitive information.
* Implement strong access controls on log files and directories.
* Encrypt log files at rest using operating system or application-level encryption.
* When using network loggers, ensure secure protocols like HTTPS or TLS are used.
* Regularly review CocoaLumberjack's logging configurations and appender settings.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Logging](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_logging.md)

**Description:** CocoaLumberjack is configured with overly verbose logging levels, or a vulnerability in the application logic causes a large number of log messages to be generated through CocoaLumberjack. This can exhaust disk space on the logging destination, impacting application performance or causing denial of service. The issue stems directly from how CocoaLumberjack is configured and used to generate logs.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, performance degradation, increased storage costs.

**Affected Component:** Core logging mechanisms within `DDLog`, all appenders (`DDFileLogger`, `DDASLLogger`, custom loggers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure log levels for different environments (e.g., less verbose in production).
* Implement log rotation policies within CocoaLumberjack's file logger or through external tools.
* Set maximum log file sizes in `DDFileLogger`.
* Monitor disk space usage on log storage locations.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Log Destinations Leading to Exposure](./threats/misconfiguration_of_log_destinations_leading_to_exposure.md)

**Description:** CocoaLumberjack's appenders are configured to write logs to insecure or publicly accessible locations. This is a direct configuration issue within CocoaLumberjack's setup. For example, `DDFileLogger` might be configured to write to a world-readable directory, or a custom network logger might be configured to send logs over an unencrypted connection without authentication.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Configuration settings for `DDFileLogger`, `DDASLLogger` (if writing to shared system logs with insufficient permissions), and custom loggers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test log destination configurations within CocoaLumberjack.
* Ensure log files are stored in secure locations with appropriate access controls.
* When using custom network loggers, implement proper authentication and encryption.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerabilities (If Improperly Used)](./threats/format_string_vulnerabilities__if_improperly_used_.md)

**Description:** Developers directly use user-controlled input as the format string in CocoaLumberjack's logging macros (e.g., `DDLogInfo(userInput);`). This is a direct misuse of CocoaLumberjack's API. An attacker could craft malicious input containing format string specifiers to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to code execution or application crashes.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, application crashes, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `DDLog` macros (`DDLogInfo`, `DDLogError`, etc.) when used with untrusted input as the format string.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never** use user-controlled input directly as the format string in CocoaLumberjack's logging macros.
* Always use predefined format strings and pass user input as arguments (e.g., `DDLogInfo(@"User input: %@", userInput);`).
* Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential format string vulnerabilities in CocoaLumberjack usage.
