## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Information via Logs](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_information_via_logs.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to gain unauthorized access to log files containing sensitive information logged by the application. This could involve directly accessing local files or intercepting network traffic if remote logging is configured. The impact is high due to the potential exposure of confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File System Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_system_permissions.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers exploit misconfigured file system permissions on the server or device where log files are stored. This allows them to bypass access controls and directly read the log files, potentially revealing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Functionality via Logging](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_functionality_via_logging.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to disrupt the normal operation of the application by manipulating the logging process. This can range from causing a denial of service to injecting malicious content into logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Logging](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_logging.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers actions within the application that cause it to generate an overwhelming amount of log data. This consumes excessive system resources (CPU, disk I/O, disk space), potentially leading to application slowdowns or outages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Log Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/log_injection_attacks.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious content into log messages. This can be done to exploit format string vulnerabilities for code execution or to inject crafted entries that can be harmful when viewed or processed by other systems (e.g., XSS in log viewers).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Format String Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_format_string_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the ability to inject format string specifiers (like `%s`, `%x`, `%n`) into log messages when user-controlled input is improperly used in logging statements. This can lead to reading from or writing to arbitrary memory locations, potentially causing crashes or enabling arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration Storage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration_storage.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers target insecurely stored logging configuration files. If these files are accessible or modifiable without proper authorization, attackers can alter logging settings to disable logging, redirect logs to a malicious server, or increase verbosity for a DoS attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Local Log Files](./attack_tree_paths/access_local_log_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents the point where an attacker successfully gains access to the local log files. This can be achieved through exploiting file system permissions or application vulnerabilities that allow reading arbitrary files. Success at this node directly leads to the exposure of logged information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Remote Logging Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_remote_logging_server.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application is configured to send logs to a remote server, that server becomes a critical node. Compromising this server grants the attacker access to all logs sent to it, potentially from multiple applications, making it a valuable target.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Format String Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_format_string_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents the successful exploitation of a format string vulnerability in a logging statement. This is critical due to the potential for arbitrary code execution, which grants the attacker significant control over the application and the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Logging Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/modify_logging_configuration.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents the point where an attacker gains the ability to modify the application's logging configuration. This is critical because it allows the attacker to manipulate the logging process for malicious purposes, such as disabling logging to hide their activities or triggering DoS attacks by increasing verbosity.
