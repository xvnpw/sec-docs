# Attack Surface Analysis for cocoalumberjack/cocoalumberjack

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Logged Data](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_logged_data.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is unintentionally or unnecessarily logged *through CocoaLumberjack*, making it accessible to unauthorized parties.

**How CocoaLumberjack Contributes:** CocoaLumberjack is the direct mechanism used by developers to write log data. The library's functionality enables the logging of this sensitive information if not used carefully.

**Example:** A developer uses CocoaLumberjack's `DDLogDebug` to log the full request body containing user credentials during an authentication attempt, and this log file is accessible to individuals with read access to the server.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data can lead to identity theft, account compromise, financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement strict data logging policies regarding CocoaLumberjack usage:** Define what data is necessary to log and what should be excluded when using CocoaLumberjack, especially in production environments.
* **Use appropriate CocoaLumberjack log levels:** Utilize debug or verbose levels within CocoaLumberjack only during development and testing. Ensure production environments use more restrictive levels like info, warning, or error with CocoaLumberjack.
* **Sanitize sensitive data before logging *with CocoaLumberjack*:** Redact or mask sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and PII before including it in log messages passed to CocoaLumberjack.
* **Regularly review log output generated by CocoaLumberjack:** Periodically inspect logs to identify any instances of unintentional sensitive data logging performed via CocoaLumberjack.
* **Educate developers on secure logging practices *with CocoaLumberjack*:** Train developers on how to use CocoaLumberjack securely and the risks of exposing sensitive information in logs generated by the library.

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection Attacks](./attack_surfaces/log_injection_attacks.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into log messages *processed by CocoaLumberjack* by manipulating input data that is subsequently logged.

**How CocoaLumberjack Contributes:** If user-supplied data is directly included in log messages passed to CocoaLumberjack without proper sanitization, CocoaLumberjack will faithfully record the injected content in the logs it manages.

**Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted username containing control characters or escape sequences. When this username is logged using CocoaLumberjack, it could manipulate the log format, potentially leading to log tampering or exploitation of log processing systems.

**Impact:**  Log injection can lead to log forgery, hiding malicious activity, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that process the logs generated by CocoaLumberjack (e.g., SIEM).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Sanitize user input before logging *with CocoaLumberjack*:** Remove or escape any characters that could be interpreted as control characters or formatting directives in log processing systems before passing data to CocoaLumberjack for logging.
* **Avoid directly concatenating unsanitized user input in CocoaLumberjack log messages:**  Construct log messages carefully to prevent injection.
* **Secure log processing systems that consume CocoaLumberjack output:** Ensure that any systems processing the logs generated by CocoaLumberjack are hardened against log injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Log File Access and Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_log_file_access_and_storage.md)

**Description:** Log files written *by CocoaLumberjack* are stored in locations with insufficient access controls, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read, modify, or delete them.

**How CocoaLumberjack Contributes:** CocoaLumberjack is directly responsible for writing the log data to the configured storage location (e.g., files). The security of this storage is directly influenced by how CocoaLumberjack is configured regarding file paths and the underlying operating system's permissions.

**Example:** Log files written by CocoaLumberjack are stored in a world-readable directory on a server. An attacker gains access to the server and can read the log files, potentially exposing sensitive information logged via CocoaLumberjack.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to log files can lead to data breaches, tampering with evidence of attacks, or denial of service by deleting critical logs generated by CocoaLumberjack.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement proper file system permissions for directories used by CocoaLumberjack:** Ensure that log files are only readable and writable by the application user or a dedicated logging user.
* **Store logs written by CocoaLumberjack in secure locations:** Avoid storing logs in publicly accessible directories or easily guessable paths configured within CocoaLumberjack.
* **Encrypt log files at rest written by CocoaLumberjack:** Consider encrypting log files to protect their contents even if unauthorized access is gained to the storage location used by CocoaLumberjack.
* **Implement secure log rotation and archiving for logs managed by CocoaLumberjack:** Regularly rotate and archive logs to limit the amount of data stored in a single location and facilitate secure storage.
