- Threat: Sensitive Information Logged
  - Description:
    - An attacker gains unauthorized access to log files stored by CocoaLumberjack (e.g., on the local filesystem, a network share, or a cloud storage bucket).
    - The attacker then reads these log files to discover sensitive information such as user credentials, API keys, session tokens, personal data, or internal system details that were inadvertently logged by the application *using CocoaLumberjack's logging functions*.
  - Impact:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive user or system data.
    - **Account Takeover:** Compromised credentials could allow attackers to access user accounts.
    - **Data Theft:**  Stolen personal or business data.
    - **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust due to data exposure.
    - **Compliance Violations:**  Breach of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
  - Affected Component:
    - `DDFileLogger` (when logging to files)
    - Potentially custom log formatters if they are not carefully designed and expose sensitive data during formatting.
  - Risk Severity: Critical
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  The primary mitigation is to prevent sensitive information from being logged in the first place when using CocoaLumberjack's logging methods.
    - **Data Masking/Redaction:** If logging sensitive data is unavoidable, implement robust masking or redaction techniques *before passing the data to CocoaLumberjack for logging*.
    - **Secure Log Storage:** Store log files generated by `DDFileLogger` in secure locations with appropriate access controls (e.g., restrict read access to authorized users and processes).
    - **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt log files generated by `DDFileLogger` at rest to protect their contents even if access controls are bypassed.

- Threat: Log Tampering
  - Description:
    - An attacker gains write access to the log files stored by CocoaLumberjack.
    - The attacker modifies or deletes existing log entries *created by CocoaLumberjack* to cover their tracks, hide malicious activity, or manipulate audit trails.
    - This could involve removing evidence of an attack or inserting false log entries to incriminate others or mislead investigations.
  - Impact:
    - **Compromised Audit Trails:** Makes it difficult or impossible to accurately investigate security incidents.
    - **Obfuscation of Attacks:** Allows attackers to remain undetected for longer periods.
    - **Repudiation:** Enables attackers to deny their actions.
    - **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Inaccurate or incomplete logs can lead to legal and regulatory problems.
  - Affected Component:
    - `DDFileLogger` (when logging to files)
    - The file system or storage mechanism where logs written by `DDFileLogger` are stored.
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - **Restrict Write Access:** Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized modification of log files generated by `DDFileLogger`.
    - **Log Integrity Checks:** Use techniques like digital signatures or cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of log files produced by `DDFileLogger`.
    - **Centralized Logging:** Send logs generated by CocoaLumberjack to a secure, centralized logging server with strong access controls and immutability features.
    - **Write-Only Access:** Configure the logging system to have write-only access to the log storage location used by `DDFileLogger`, preventing even the application from modifying existing entries.

- Threat: Log Injection
  - Description:
    - An attacker exploits insufficient input validation or sanitization when the application logs user-supplied data *using CocoaLumberjack's logging functions*.
    - The attacker crafts malicious input that, when logged, is interpreted as commands or control characters by downstream log processing systems (e.g., log aggregators, security information and event management (SIEM) systems).
    - This can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the log processing system or the manipulation of log data within those systems.
  - Impact:
    - **Remote Code Execution:**  On the log processing system if the injected data is interpreted as a command.
    - **Log Manipulation:**  Insertion of false log entries or modification of existing ones within the downstream system.
    - **Denial of Service:**  Overloading the log processing system with malicious log entries.
    - **Security Alert Evasion:**  Injecting data to suppress or alter security alerts.
  - Affected Component:
    - Any part of the application code that logs user-supplied data using `DDLog` functions in CocoaLumberjack.
    - Potentially custom log formatters used with CocoaLumberjack if they don't properly escape or sanitize data before formatting.
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize or encode any user-supplied data before including it in log messages *passed to CocoaLumberjack*.
    - **Parameterized Logging:** If the logging framework supports it (while CocoaLumberjack doesn't have explicit parameterized logging in the same way some other frameworks do, careful formatting can achieve similar results), structure log messages to separate data from the log message structure.
    - **Output Encoding:** Ensure that log data generated by CocoaLumberjack is properly encoded when it is written to the log file or transmitted to downstream systems.
    - **Secure Log Processing:**  Implement security measures on downstream log processing systems to prevent the execution of arbitrary commands or the manipulation of log data.

- Threat: Insecure Transmission of Logs to Remote Servers
  - Description:
    - The application uses a custom log appender or integration with CocoaLumberjack to send logs to a remote logging server or service.
    - This transmission, implemented *outside of CocoaLumberjack's core functionality but as an extension to it*, is not properly secured using encryption (e.g., HTTPS/TLS).
    - Attackers on the network can intercept the log data being transmitted and potentially read sensitive information contained within the logs.
  - Impact:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive information in transit.
    - **Data Theft:** Interception of valuable data being logged.
    - **Compromised Credentials:**  If credentials for other systems are logged and transmitted insecurely.
  - Affected Component:
    - Custom `DDLogAppender` implementations or integrations that handle network transmission of logs generated by CocoaLumberjack.
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - **Use Secure Protocols:**  Always use secure protocols like HTTPS/TLS when transmitting logs to remote servers from custom CocoaLumberjack appenders.
    - **Encryption in Transit:** Ensure that the communication channel between the application (specifically the custom log appender) and the remote logging server is encrypted.
    - **VPN or Secure Network:**  Consider using a VPN or other secure network connection for log transmission, especially over public networks.
    - **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the remote logging server from the custom appender.
