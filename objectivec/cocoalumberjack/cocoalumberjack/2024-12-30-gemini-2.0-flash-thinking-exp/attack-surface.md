Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving CocoaLumberjack, focusing on high and critical severity:

* **Log File Location and Permissions Vulnerability**
    * **Description:** The application writes log files to a location on the file system where unauthorized users or processes can gain read or write access.
    * **How CocoaLumberjack Contributes:** CocoaLumberjack is directly responsible for writing the log files to the specified location. The library's configuration determines where these potentially sensitive files are created.
    * **Example:** An Android application logs to external storage without proper permissions, allowing other applications to read the log files containing user data.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive data within logs), potential for log tampering if write access is granted, leading to compromised audit trails.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure CocoaLumberjack to store log files in secure, application-specific internal storage locations.
        * On platforms with file system permissions, ensure that log files are only readable and writable by the application's process.
        * Avoid using user-controlled paths for log file storage.

* **Information Disclosure through Verbose Logging**
    * **Description:** The application is configured to log at a very detailed level, inadvertently including sensitive information in the log output.
    * **How CocoaLumberjack Contributes:** CocoaLumberjack's log level settings directly control the verbosity of the logs. Incorrectly configured log levels expose sensitive data handled by the application and logged via CocoaLumberjack.
    * **Example:** An application logs API keys or authentication tokens at the `debug` level in a production build, making them accessible to anyone who can access the logs.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, personal data, or business-critical information, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or regulatory violations.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strictly control log levels in production environments. Use the least verbose level necessary (e.g., `info`, `warning`, `error`).
        * Implement compile-time or runtime checks to prevent overly verbose logging in production builds.
        * Utilize CocoaLumberjack's filtering capabilities to selectively log specific components or messages, avoiding broad, verbose logging.
        * Regularly review log configurations and output to ensure sensitive data is not being inadvertently logged.
