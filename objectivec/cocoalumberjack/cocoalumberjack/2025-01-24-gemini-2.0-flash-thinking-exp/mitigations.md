## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Strict Log Level Management in Cocoalumberjack](./mitigation_strategies/1__strict_log_level_management_in_cocoalumberjack.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Cocoalumberjack Log Level Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Environment-Specific Log Levels:** Utilize Cocoalumberjack's configuration to set different log levels for development, staging, and production environments.
        *   **Development/Staging:** Configure Cocoalumberjack to use verbose levels like `DDLogLevelDebug` or `DDLogLevelInfo` for detailed debugging during development and testing.
        *   **Production:**  Configure Cocoalumberjack to use restrictive levels like `DDLogLevelWarning`, `DDLogLevelError`, or `DDLogLevelFatal` in production to minimize logged information and reduce the risk of information disclosure.
    2.  **Centralized Cocoalumberjack Configuration:** Manage Cocoalumberjack's log level settings through a centralized configuration mechanism (e.g., configuration files, environment variables) to ensure consistent application across environments and easy adjustments.
    3.  **Runtime Log Level Adjustment (Cocoalumberjack Feature):** Leverage Cocoalumberjack's ability to dynamically adjust log levels at runtime. This allows for temporary increase in verbosity for debugging specific production issues without redeploying with permanently verbose settings.
    4.  **Code Reviews Focusing on Cocoalumberjack Usage:** During code reviews, specifically check for appropriate use of Cocoalumberjack log levels and ensure developers are not inadvertently using overly verbose logging in production code paths.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Excessive Logging (High Severity):** Accidental logging of sensitive data in production logs due to overly verbose log levels configured in Cocoalumberjack.
    *   **Log File Size DoS (Low Severity):** Excessive logging filling up disk space due to verbose log levels in Cocoalumberjack, potentially leading to service disruption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of accidentally logging sensitive data in production by controlling the verbosity of Cocoalumberjack logging output based on environment.
    *   **Log File Size DoS:** Medium - Helps control log file size by reducing unnecessary logging through Cocoalumberjack's level management, but doesn't prevent DoS from intentional log flooding at the configured level.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Environment-specific log levels are generally set using configuration files that are then used to configure Cocoalumberjack.
    *   **Location:** Configuration files, logging initialization code where Cocoalumberjack is configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal documentation of environment-specific log level configurations and guidelines for Cocoalumberjack usage.
    *   Runtime log level adjustment feature of Cocoalumberjack is not actively utilized for dynamic debugging.
