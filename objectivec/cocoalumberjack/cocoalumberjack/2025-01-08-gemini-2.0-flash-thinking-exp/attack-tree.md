## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via CocoaLumberjack Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_cocoalumberjack_exploitation.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and the root of all potential exploits leveraging CocoaLumberjack. Its criticality lies in representing the complete compromise of the application through this specific vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Exploit Logged Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_logged_sensitive_information.md)

**Description:** The attacker aims to access sensitive data that the application unintentionally logs using CocoaLumberjack. This path is high-risk due to the potential for significant data breaches if successful.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path

    * **High-Risk Path: Access Sensitive Data in Log Files**
        * **Description:** The attacker directly accesses log files to retrieve sensitive information. This is a high-risk path due to the direct exposure of potentially confidential data.
        * **Critical Node: Gain Unauthorized Access to Log Storage**
            * **Description:**  Gaining unauthorized access to where log files are stored is a critical step, as it provides the attacker with the means to read the log contents.
            * **High-Risk Path: Exploit File System Permissions**
                * **Description:** Attackers exploit weak file system permissions to directly read log files stored locally.
                * **Likelihood:** Medium
                * **Impact:** High
                * **Effort:** Low
                * **Skill Level:** Low
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            * **High-Risk Path: Exploit Cloud Storage Misconfiguration (if applicable)**
                * **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigured access policies in cloud storage services where logs are stored.
                * **Likelihood:** Medium
                * **Impact:** High
                * **Effort:** Medium
                * **Skill Level:** Medium
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    * **High-Risk Path: Intercept Sensitive Data During Log Transmission**
        * **Description:** The attacker intercepts sensitive data while it is being transmitted to a central logging server or other destination. This is high-risk if the transmission is not properly secured.
        * **Critical Node: Sniff Network Traffic (if transmitting logs over network)**
            * **Description:**  If logs are transmitted unencrypted over the network, attackers can use network sniffing tools to intercept and read the data. This is a critical point of vulnerability.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** High
            * **Effort:** Low
            * **Skill Level:** Low
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Inject Malicious Content via Logging](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_inject_malicious_content_via_logging.md)

**Description:** The attacker injects malicious content into log streams to compromise downstream systems or manipulate application behavior. This path is high-risk due to the potential for code execution or manipulation of critical systems.
* **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Effort:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path

    * **High-Risk Path: Achieve Code Execution via Log Injection**
        * **Description:** The attacker successfully injects content into logs that is interpreted as executable code by log processing tools or viewing applications. This is a critical path leading to system compromise.
        * **Critical Node: Achieve Code Execution via Log Injection**
            * **Description:** Successfully achieving code execution via log injection represents a critical breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path & Critical Node: Disable or Degrade Logging Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_&_critical_node_disable_or_degrade_logging_functionality.md)

**Description:** The attacker manipulates the logging configuration to either expose more information or, more critically, disable or degrade logging functionality, hindering security monitoring and incident response.
* **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Effort:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path
* **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the specific sub-path

    * **High-Risk Path: Modify Configuration to Drop or Ignore Logs**
        * **Description:** The attacker gains write access to the logging configuration and modifies it to prevent certain logs from being recorded or processed. This is a high-risk path as it can blind security monitoring and allow malicious activity to go unnoticed.
        * **Critical Node: Disable or Degrade Logging Functionality**
            * **Description:**  Successfully disabling or significantly degrading logging capabilities is a critical security failure, as it removes a key visibility and detection mechanism.
