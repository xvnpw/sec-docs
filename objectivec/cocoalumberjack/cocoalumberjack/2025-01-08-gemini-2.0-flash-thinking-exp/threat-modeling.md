# Threat Model Analysis for cocoalumberjack/cocoalumberjack

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

**Description:** CocoaLumberjack, if not configured carefully, can inadvertently log sensitive information such as user credentials, API keys, personal data, or internal system details. An attacker gaining access to these log files (through insecure permissions, server access, or intercepted transmission) can directly obtain this sensitive data.

**Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage, and potential legal repercussions due to privacy violations.

**Affected CocoaLumberjack Component:** Primarily the logging mechanism itself and the configuration of log destinations (e.g., `DDFileLogger`, `DDASLLogger`, custom appenders). The formatters used (`DDLogFormatter`) can also contribute if they don't sanitize data.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid logging sensitive information in production environments.
*   Implement strict access controls on log files and directories.
*   Use secure methods for transmitting logs to remote services (e.g., TLS encryption).
*   Regularly review log configurations and content to identify and remove inadvertently logged sensitive data.
*   Utilize log formatters to redact or mask sensitive data before logging.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Appenders or Formatters](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_appenders_or_formatters.md)

**Description:** If the application uses custom log appenders or formatters for CocoaLumberjack, vulnerabilities in this custom code can be directly exploited. An attacker could leverage flaws in the custom code to achieve arbitrary code execution, information disclosure (beyond what's normally logged), or denial of service by manipulating how logs are processed or where they are sent.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code, including system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Affected CocoaLumberjack Component:** Custom `DDLogFileManager` subclasses, `DDLogFormatter` implementations, and `DDLogAppender` implementations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test custom appenders and formatters for security vulnerabilities.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom logging components.
*   Keep dependencies of custom components up to date.
*   Consider using well-vetted and established logging appenders instead of developing custom ones.

## Threat: [Exposure of Log Files in Web Server Directories](./threats/exposure_of_log_files_in_web_server_directories.md)

**Description:** If log files generated by CocoaLumberjack are inadvertently stored within the web server's document root or other publicly accessible directories, an attacker can directly access and download these files via HTTP requests. This is a direct consequence of how CocoaLumberjack is configured to store logs.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information contained within the log files, potentially leading to data breaches or other security compromises.

**Affected CocoaLumberjack Component:** The file logging component (`DDFileLogger`) and the configuration of the log file path.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that log files are stored outside of the web server's document root.
*   Configure the web server to prevent direct access to log files (e.g., using `.htaccess` or similar mechanisms).
*   Regularly review the application's file storage configuration to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive files.
