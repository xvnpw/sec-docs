# Attack Surface Analysis for cocoalumberjack/cocoalumberjack

## Attack Surface: [Logging of Sensitive Information](./attack_surfaces/logging_of_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental or intentional inclusion of sensitive data (e.g., credentials, API keys, PII) within log messages generated by CocoaLumberjack.
    *   **CocoaLumberjack Contribution:** Provides the mechanism for writing log messages, making it the conduit through which sensitive data can be persisted.
    *   **Example:** A developer logs the request body containing a user's password during debugging, and this log is stored in a file.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, compliance violations, reputational damage, identity theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes to identify and prevent logging of sensitive data.
        *   Utilize CocoaLumberjack's features for message formatting and redaction to sanitize log output.
        *   Avoid logging request/response bodies or sensitive parameters in production environments.
        *   Educate developers on secure logging practices and the risks of exposing sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Log Files](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_log_files.md)

*   **Description:** Log files generated by CocoaLumberjack are stored in locations with insecure permissions, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **CocoaLumberjack Contribution:** While CocoaLumberjack doesn't directly manage file permissions, it allows specifying the location where log files are written. If developers choose insecure locations or don't configure appropriate permissions, it contributes to the risk.
    *   **Example:** Log files are written to a world-readable directory on the file system.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential information within logs can be accessed by attackers, leading to data breaches or further compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store log files in secure locations with restricted access permissions (e.g., only readable by the application's user or a dedicated logging user).
        *   Implement log rotation and archiving mechanisms to manage log file sizes and retention.
        *   Consider encrypting log files at rest for sensitive applications.
