## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization/Masking (Custom Formatter)](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitizationmasking__custom_formatter_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Data Sanitization/Masking (Custom Formatter)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Custom `DDLogFormatter`:** Subclass `DDLogFormatter` and override the `formatLogMessage:` method. This is the core CocoaLumberjack mechanism for controlling log message formatting.
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Logic:** Within `formatLogMessage:`, use regular expressions (`NSRegularExpression`), string manipulation, or a dedicated sanitization library to identify and redact/mask/encrypt sensitive data *within the log message string*.
    3.  **Register Formatter:** Use `[logger addLogFormatter:yourCustomFormatter]` to attach your custom formatter to the appropriate `DDLogger` instances (e.g., `DDFileLogger`, `DDASLLogger`).  This ensures your sanitization logic is applied to all messages passing through that logger.
    4. **Prioritize Formatter:** If multiple formatters are used, ensure the sanitization formatter is applied *before* any formatters that might add additional information (like timestamps or thread IDs). This prevents accidentally logging sensitive data that was added *after* sanitization.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive data from being written to logs.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High):** Helps meet data protection regulations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces risk, dependent on the robustness of the sanitization logic.
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Reduces risk of non-compliance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `NetworkManager.swift` (basic API key masking, inconsistent).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `UserProfile.swift`, `DatabaseManager.swift`, `PaymentProcessor.swift` (no sanitization).
    *   No global custom formatter applied to all loggers.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Level Management (Dynamic & Environment-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/log_level_management__dynamic_&_environment-specific_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Log Level Management (Dynamic & Environment-Specific)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `DDLogLevel` Constants:**  Strictly adhere to CocoaLumberjack's log level constants (`DDLogLevelDebug`, `DDLogLevelInfo`, `DDLogLevelWarning`, `DDLogLevelError`, `DDLogLevelOff`).
    2.  **Environment-Based Configuration:**
        *   Use preprocessor macros (e.g., `#if DEBUG`) or environment variables to set different log levels for development, staging, and production builds.  This is directly tied to how CocoaLumberjack is initialized.
        *   Example (using preprocessor macros):
            ```objectivec
            #if DEBUG
                DDLogLevel ddLogLevel = DDLogLevelDebug;
            #else
                DDLogLevel ddLogLevel = DDLogLevelWarning;
            #endif
            ```
    3.  **Dynamic Level Adjustment (Securely):**
        *   If dynamic adjustment is needed, use a *secure* mechanism (authenticated and authorized) to call `[DDLog setLevel:forClass:]` or `[DDLog setLevel:forLogger:]`.  This allows changing the log level of specific classes or loggers at runtime.  *Do not expose this functionality to untrusted users.*
        *   Log any changes made via this dynamic mechanism (see Audit Logging, though that's less CocoaLumberjack-specific).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the volume of logged information.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: Low):** Helps prevent excessive logging.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Low):** Improves performance by reducing logging overhead.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk, but sanitization is still primary.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Basic protection.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Improves performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic log levels in `AppDelegate.swift`, but not environment-specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No environment-specific configuration.
    *   No secure dynamic log level adjustment.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Throttling (Custom Logger/Formatter)](./mitigation_strategies/log_throttling__custom_loggerformatter_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Log Throttling (Custom Logger/Formatter)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Custom `DDLogger` or `DDLogFormatter`:** Create a subclass of either `DDLogger` or `DDLogFormatter`.  The choice depends on whether you want to throttle *before* or *after* formatting.  A custom logger gives more control.
    2.  **Throttling Logic:**
        *   Within your custom class, maintain state (e.g., a counter, a timestamp of the last log message).
        *   Implement logic to check if the logging rate exceeds a predefined threshold (messages per second, bytes per minute, etc.).
        *   If the threshold is exceeded, *drop* subsequent log messages (by returning `NO` from `logMessage:` in a custom logger, or by returning an empty string from `formatLogMessage:` in a custom formatter).  Alternatively, reduce the log level of the message.
        *   Optionally, log a *single* warning message (at a high log level) indicating that throttling is active.  Avoid logging *every* dropped message.
    3.  **Register Custom Component:** Add your custom logger or formatter to the CocoaLumberjack logging pipeline using `[DDLog addLogger:yourCustomLogger]` or `[logger addLogFormatter:yourCustomFormatter]`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: Medium):** Prevents logging-based DoS attacks.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Reduces logging overhead.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Significant protection.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Improves responsiveness.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No log throttling mechanism.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Asynchronous Logging (`logAsync`)](./mitigation_strategies/asynchronous_logging___logasync__.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Asynchronous Logging (`logAsync`)**

*   **Description:**
    *   Use the `logAsync` property of your loggers (especially `DDFileLogger`) to enable asynchronous logging. This is a direct CocoaLumberjack feature.
    *   Example: `fileLogger.logAsync = YES;`
    *   Asynchronous logging prevents logging operations from blocking the main thread, improving application responsiveness and reducing the impact of slow logging operations (e.g., writing to a slow disk or network).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Medium):** Prevents logging from blocking the main thread.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: Low):** Indirectly helps by making the application more resilient to slow logging operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Improves responsiveness, especially under heavy logging load.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Minor improvement in resilience.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Needs to be verified for all loggers, especially `DDFileLogger`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially not enabled for all relevant loggers.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Rotation Configuration (`DDFileLogger`)](./mitigation_strategies/log_rotation_configuration___ddfilelogger__.md)

**5. Mitigation Strategy:  Log Rotation Configuration (`DDFileLogger`)

*   **Description:**
    *   Configure the `DDFileLogger` instance with appropriate values for:
        *   `rollingFrequency`: How often to roll over to a new log file (e.g., daily, hourly).
        *   `maximumFileSize`: The maximum size of a log file before rolling over.
        *   `maximumNumberOfLogFiles`: The maximum number of archived log files to keep.
    *   These settings are directly controlled through the `DDFileLogger` properties.  Proper configuration prevents log files from growing unbounded.
    * Example:
    ```objectivec
    DDFileLogger *fileLogger = [[DDFileLogger alloc] init];
    fileLogger.rollingFrequency = 60 * 60 * 24; // 24 hours
    fileLogger.maximumFileSize = 1024 * 1024 * 10; // 10 MB
    fileLogger.logFileManager.maximumNumberOfLogFiles = 7;
    ```

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (Severity: Low):** Prevents disk space exhaustion due to uncontrolled log file growth.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Prevents disk space exhaustion.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic log rotation is configured, but values need review.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and potentially adjust `rollingFrequency`, `maximumFileSize`, and `maximumNumberOfLogFiles` based on application needs and risk assessment.
