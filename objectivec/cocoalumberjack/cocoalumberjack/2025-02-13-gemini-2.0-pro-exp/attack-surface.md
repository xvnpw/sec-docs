# Attack Surface Analysis for cocoalumberjack/cocoalumberjack

## Attack Surface: [Log File Exposure (Unauthorized Access)](./attack_surfaces/log_file_exposure__unauthorized_access_.md)

*Description:* Unauthorized access to log files containing sensitive information written by CocoaLumberjack.
*CocoaLumberjack Contribution:* CocoaLumberjack's core function is to write logs to files (or other destinations).  The framework's configuration determines *where* and *how* these files are written, directly impacting their exposure.  Misconfiguration is the key risk here.
*Example:* CocoaLumberjack is configured to write logs to a directory with overly permissive file permissions (e.g., world-readable), allowing any user on the system to read the log files.
*Impact:* Data breach, account compromise, unauthorized access to application functionality, reputational damage.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (if sensitive data is logged) or **High** (if less sensitive data is logged).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure Storage:** Use `FileManager` to create application-specific directories with *restricted* permissions.  Ensure only the application process can access the log files.  Leverage the operating system's sandboxing features.
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt log files at rest using CocoaLumberjack's capabilities or a separate encryption mechanism.  This protects data even if the file system is compromised.
    *   **Access Control (OS Level):** Utilize operating system-level access controls (e.g., user accounts, groups, file permissions) to restrict access to the log files.
    *   **Regular Rotation & Deletion:** Configure CocoaLumberjack's log rotation features to limit the size and lifespan of log files.  Securely delete old logs.

## Attack Surface: [Excessive Logging (Information Disclosure) - *When Combined with CocoaLumberjack's File Output*](./attack_surfaces/excessive_logging__information_disclosure__-_when_combined_with_cocoalumberjack's_file_output.md)

*Description:* Logging too much sensitive information, which, *because CocoaLumberjack writes it to a file*, increases the risk of exposure if that file is compromised.  This is the crucial link to CocoaLumberjack.
*CocoaLumberjack Contribution:* While the *decision* to log excessively is a developer error, CocoaLumberjack's role is to *persist* that excessive data to a file (or other output), making it a tangible target for attackers.
*Example:* An application logs full HTTP request bodies (including user credentials) in debug mode.  CocoaLumberjack writes these requests to a log file.  An attacker gains access to the log file.
*Impact:* Data breach, account compromise, exposure of internal application details.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (depending on the sensitivity of the logged data).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Log Level Discipline:** Strictly adhere to log level conventions.  Use `DDLogLevelDebug` *only* during development and *never* in production.  Configure CocoaLumberjack to filter log levels appropriately for different environments.
    *   **Data Minimization:** Within your logging calls, log *only* the essential information.  Avoid logging entire objects or large data structures if they contain sensitive fields.
    *   **Sanitization (Pre-Logging):** *Before* passing data to CocoaLumberjack, sanitize or redact sensitive information. This is crucial. CocoaLumberjack won't do this automatically.
    *   **Auditing (of Logging Calls):** Regularly review the *code that calls* CocoaLumberjack's logging methods to ensure that sensitive data is not being inadvertently logged.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Custom Loggers/Formatters (Specific to CocoaLumberjack Extensions)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_custom_loggersformatters__specific_to_cocoalumberjack_extensions_.md)

*Description:* Custom loggers or formatters *written for CocoaLumberjack* introduce security vulnerabilities. This is distinct from general custom code vulnerabilities.
*CocoaLumberjack Contribution:* CocoaLumberjack's extensibility allows developers to create custom components that interact directly with the logging pipeline.  These components, if flawed, become part of CocoaLumberjack's attack surface.
*Example:* A custom CocoaLumberjack formatter incorrectly handles user input, leading to a log injection vulnerability *within the formatting process itself*. Or, a custom logger sends logs to an insecure remote server without encryption.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the vulnerability (e.g., data breach, code execution within the logger/formatter, denial of service).
*Risk Severity:* **High** (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure Coding (for Extensions):** Apply secure coding principles *specifically* when developing CocoaLumberjack extensions.  Treat these components as high-risk areas.
    *   **Code Review (Focused):** Conduct thorough code reviews of *all* custom CocoaLumberjack loggers and formatters, with a specific focus on security.
    *   **Input Validation (Within Extensions):** If custom components handle any external input (even from other parts of the application), rigorously validate that input *within the component itself*.
    *   **Least Privilege (for Loggers):** Ensure custom loggers operate with the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid granting excessive file system or network access.
    *   **Testing (Security-Focused):** Perform security-focused testing of custom loggers and formatters, including fuzzing and penetration testing.
