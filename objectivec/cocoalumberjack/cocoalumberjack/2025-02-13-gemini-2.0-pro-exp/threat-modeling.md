# Threat Model Analysis for cocoalumberjack/cocoalumberjack

## Threat: [Threat: Sensitive Data Exposure via Logging](./threats/threat_sensitive_data_exposure_via_logging.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Logging

    *   **Description:** An attacker, either with physical access to the device or through a separate vulnerability that allows file system access, reads log files containing sensitive information written by CocoaLumberjack. Alternatively, if CocoaLumberjack is configured to send logs to a remote service, an attacker might intercept the network traffic or compromise the remote logging service. The attacker leverages CocoaLumberjack's logging functionality to obtain sensitive data that was improperly logged by the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of PII, financial data, authentication tokens, or other confidential information.
        *   Identity theft, financial fraud, unauthorized access to accounts, reputational damage.
        *   Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    *   **Affected CocoaLumberjack Component:**
        *   `DDFileLogger` (if storing logs locally).
        *   Custom loggers that send data to remote services (if the transmission is insecure).
        *   Any logger using a `DDLogFormatter` that *doesn't* redact sensitive data.
        *   The logging macros themselves (`DDLogInfo`, `DDLogDebug`, etc.) *when misused* to log sensitive data. This is the *direct* point of failure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Logging Policy:** Enforce a strict policy *prohibiting* the logging of sensitive data. This is paramount.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews to specifically check for violations of the logging policy, focusing on calls to `DDLog...` macros.
        *   **Custom Formatters:** Implement custom `DDLogFormatter` instances to automatically redact or mask sensitive data *before* it's written to the log. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Log Level Control:** Use appropriate log levels; avoid verbose logging (e.g., `DDLogLevelDebug`) in production environments. Configure production logging to only include `Error` or `Warning` levels.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store log files in the application's secure sandbox, using appropriate file permissions.
        *   **Encryption:** Encrypt log files at rest using iOS Data Protection APIs or a custom encryption solution (this is *essential* for sensitive data).
        *   **Log Rotation/Deletion:** Implement a policy to automatically rotate and delete old log files, limiting the exposure window.
        *   **Secure Remote Logging:** If using remote logging (via a custom logger), use HTTPS with a strong TLS configuration and authenticate the connection. Ensure the remote log storage is also secured with access controls and encryption.

## Threat: [Threat: Misconfiguration Leading to Sensitive Data Exposure](./threats/threat_misconfiguration_leading_to_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration Leading to Sensitive Data Exposure

    *   **Description:** CocoaLumberjack is misconfigured, specifically in a way that increases the risk of sensitive data exposure.  This could involve setting an inappropriately verbose log level (e.g., `DDLogLevelDebug`) in a production environment, failing to implement a custom formatter for redaction, or configuring a custom logger to send logs to an insecure destination. The attacker exploits the *incorrect configuration* of CocoaLumberjack, rather than a vulnerability in the library itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Increased likelihood of sensitive data being logged and exposed.
        *   Similar consequences to the "Sensitive Data Exposure" threat above (identity theft, fraud, etc.).
    *   **Affected CocoaLumberjack Component:**
        *   All components are potentially affected, depending on the misconfiguration. This includes `DDLog`, `DDFileLogger`, `DDASLLogger`, custom loggers, and `DDLogFormatter` implementations. The *configuration* of these components is the key.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Centralized Configuration:** Manage CocoaLumberjack configuration in a single, well-defined, and version-controlled location. Avoid scattering configuration settings throughout the codebase.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement programmatic checks to ensure the logging configuration is valid and secure *before* the application starts logging. This could involve checking log levels, formatter settings, and destination URLs.
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test the logging configuration in various environments (development, testing, *especially* production) to ensure it behaves as expected and doesn't expose sensitive data.
        *   **Documentation:** Clearly document the logging configuration, its purpose, and the security considerations.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to logging. Only log the information that is absolutely necessary for operational and debugging purposes.
