*   **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via DOM Manipulation**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application that are executed in the user's browser due to Shimmer's DOM manipulation.
    *   **How Shimmer Contributes:** If the application uses user-provided data to influence the content or structure of the placeholder elements created by Shimmer without proper encoding, it can lead to XSS. Shimmer's role in dynamically generating and updating DOM elements makes it a potential vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a malicious string as part of data that is used to construct a Shimmer placeholder's text content. If this string contains a `<script>` tag, it will be rendered and executed in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Always encode user-provided data for the HTML context before using it to populate Shimmer placeholders. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by the framework or language. Treat all user input as untrusted.
