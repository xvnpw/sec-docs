## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using Three20 - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Three20 library.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application via Three20 **CRITICAL NODE**
    * Exploit Known Three20 Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**, **HIGH RISK PATH**
        * Identify Known Vulnerability
        * Exploit Identified Vulnerability
    * Abuse Three20 Functionality for Malicious Purposes
        * Exploit Insecure Image Handling **CRITICAL NODE**, **HIGH RISK PATH**
            * Supply Maliciously Crafted Image
            * Trigger Three20 Image Processing
    * Exploit Dependencies of Three20 **CRITICAL NODE**, **HIGH RISK PATH**
        * Identify Vulnerable Dependency
        * Exploit Vulnerable Dependency

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Known Three20 Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on leveraging publicly known security flaws within the Three20 library itself. Given its archived status, it's highly probable that unpatched vulnerabilities exist.
* **Identify Known Vulnerability:**
    * **Search Public Databases (CVE, NVD):** Attackers will search for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) or National Vulnerability Database (NVD) entries specifically associated with Three20.
    * **Analyze Three20 Source Code (if available):** If the source code is accessible, attackers with reverse engineering skills can analyze it to identify potential security weaknesses.
    * **Review Security Advisories/Discussions:**  Historical security advisories, blog posts, or discussions in developer communities might reveal known vulnerabilities or attack patterns.
* **Exploit Identified Vulnerability:**
    * **Craft Malicious Input/Request:** Once a vulnerability is identified, attackers will craft specific inputs or requests designed to trigger the flaw. This could involve manipulating data structures, exceeding buffer limits, or providing unexpected values.
    * **Trigger Vulnerable Code Path:** The crafted input is then used to interact with the application in a way that forces the Three20 library to execute the vulnerable code, leading to potential outcomes like remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**2. Exploit Insecure Image Handling (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** This path targets vulnerabilities in how Three20 processes image files. Image parsing and decoding are common sources of security flaws.
* **Supply Maliciously Crafted Image:**
    * **Exploit Buffer Overflows in Image Decoding:** Attackers create image files with carefully crafted data that, when processed by Three20's image decoding routines, overflows a buffer, potentially overwriting memory and allowing for code execution.
    * **Trigger Code Execution via Image Metadata:** Some image formats allow for embedding metadata. Attackers might craft images with malicious code embedded in the metadata, which could be executed when Three20 processes the image.
* **Trigger Three20 Image Processing:** The attacker needs to ensure the application uses Three20 to load and process the malicious image. This could involve uploading the image, providing a URL to the image, or any other mechanism that triggers Three20's image handling functionality.

**3. Exploit Dependencies of Three20 (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):**

* **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries that Three20 relies upon. Archived projects often use older versions of dependencies, which are more likely to have known vulnerabilities.
* **Identify Vulnerable Dependency:**
    * **Analyze Three20's Dependency List:** Attackers will examine the project's build files or dependency management configurations to identify the libraries Three20 uses.
    * **Check for Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Once the dependencies are identified, attackers will search public databases (like CVE, NVD, or specific language package repositories) for known vulnerabilities in those specific versions of the libraries.
* **Exploit Vulnerable Dependency:**
    * **Trigger Functionality Relying on Vulnerable Dependency:** Attackers need to find a way to interact with the application such that Three20 uses the vulnerable dependency in a way that exposes the flaw.
    * **Supply Input that Exploits Dependency Vulnerability:**  Similar to exploiting Three20 directly, attackers will craft specific inputs that target the identified vulnerability within the dependency. This could lead to various outcomes depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.
