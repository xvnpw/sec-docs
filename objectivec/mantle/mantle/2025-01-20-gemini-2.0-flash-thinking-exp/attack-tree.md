## Attack Tree Path: [Attack: Compromise Mantle-Based Application (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/attack_compromise_mantle-based_application__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the attacker has achieved significant control over the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in Mantle (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses_in_mantle__critical_node_.md)

This category represents a fundamental failure in the application's security. If authentication or authorization is compromised, attackers can gain unauthorized access and bypass intended security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Credential Management (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_credential_management__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Default Credentials (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_default_credentials__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting the possibility that Mantle or the application using it has default usernames and passwords that are publicly known or easily guessable.
        Impact: Direct and immediate access to the application with the privileges of the default account.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/brute-forcecredential_stuffing__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Attempting to guess user credentials by systematically trying different combinations (brute-force) or using lists of previously compromised credentials from other breaches (credential stuffing).
        Impact: Gaining unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially with high privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Session Hijacking (via XSS in Mantle UI components) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/session_hijacking__via_xss_in_mantle_ui_components___high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: If Mantle's UI components are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. These scripts can steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim user.
    Impact: Complete takeover of a user's session, granting the attacker all the privileges of that user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Mantle's UI Components (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_mantle's_ui_components__critical_node_.md)

This category highlights the risks associated with insecurely developed UI components within Mantle, primarily focusing on Cross-Site Scripting.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss___high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Stored XSS (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/stored_xss__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts that are permanently stored within the application's data (e.g., in database entries). These scripts are then executed whenever other users view the affected data.
        Impact: Can affect multiple users, potentially leading to widespread compromise, data theft, or malware distribution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reflected XSS (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/reflected_xss__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts into a website's request parameters or other inputs, which are then reflected back to the user's browser without proper sanitization. This often requires social engineering to trick users into clicking malicious links.
        Impact: Can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities Introduced by Mantle (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_mantle__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Mantle handles and stores data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Data Storage (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_data_storage__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Storing Sensitive Data in Plaintext (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/storing_sensitive_data_in_plaintext__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Storing sensitive information (like passwords, API keys, personal data) without encryption. If an attacker gains access to the storage, this data is readily available.
        Impact: Direct exposure of sensitive information, leading to potential identity theft, financial loss, and further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/data_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (if Mantle interacts with databases) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__if_mantle_interacts_with_databases___high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through user inputs. This allows attackers to bypass security checks and directly interact with the database.
        Impact: Ability to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data in the database, potentially leading to complete data breaches or application takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Mantle Deployment (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_mantle_deployment__critical_node_.md)

This category highlights the risks associated with improper setup and configuration of the Mantle framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configurations (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configurations__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Mantle might have default settings that are insecure (e.g., weak default passwords, open ports). If these are not changed during deployment, they can be easily exploited.
    Impact: Exposing the application to known vulnerabilities and making it easier for attackers to gain initial access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Storing sensitive information (like API keys, database credentials) directly in configuration files that might be accessible to unauthorized individuals or through insecure channels.
    Impact: Providing attackers with the necessary credentials to access other systems or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Mantle (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_mantle__high_risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Mantle relies on other software libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them through the Mantle application.
    Impact: The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it can range from denial of service to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mantle's API (if exposed) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mantle's_api__if_exposed___critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities in the API provided by Mantle, if it exposes one.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Proper Authentication/Authorization for API Endpoints (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_proper_authenticationauthorization_for_api_endpoints__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: API endpoints that are not properly secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms can be accessed by anyone, allowing attackers to bypass intended security controls and access sensitive functionalities or data.
    Impact: Unauthorized access to API functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in API Endpoints (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_api_endpoints__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: API endpoints that do not properly validate user input are vulnerable to injection attacks (like SQL injection or command injection) and other forms of malicious input.
    Impact: Can lead to data breaches, remote code execution, or other forms of compromise depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
