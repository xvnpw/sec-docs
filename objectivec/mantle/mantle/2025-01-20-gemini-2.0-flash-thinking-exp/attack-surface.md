# Attack Surface Analysis for mantle/mantle

## Attack Surface: [Insecure gRPC Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_grpc_communication.md)

**Description:** Communication between microservices using gRPC is not encrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data in transit.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle relies heavily on gRPC for inter-service communication. If TLS is not explicitly configured within the Mantle application's gRPC setup, the default might be unencrypted communication.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network intercepts gRPC requests containing user credentials or financial information being passed between two Mantle-based services because TLS was not enabled in the Mantle service configuration.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data theft, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce TLS for all gRPC connections within the Mantle application's configuration.
*   Configure gRPC servers and clients within Mantle services to require TLS certificates.
*   Regularly review and update TLS configurations and certificates used by Mantle services.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Mutual TLS (mTLS)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_mutual_tls__mtls_.md)

**Description:** While TLS encrypts communication, it doesn't verify the identity of both the client and the server. This allows for potential service impersonation.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle's gRPC usage can be configured with TLS, but enabling mTLS requires explicit configuration within the Mantle service setup and certificate management.

**Example:** A malicious service, deployed within the infrastructure, pretends to be a legitimate service and intercepts requests from other Mantle services because mTLS was not configured in the Mantle application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, potential for cascading failures if a core service is compromised.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for gRPC connections within the Mantle application to verify the identity of both communicating services.
*   Establish a robust certificate management system for issuing and rotating client and server certificates used by Mantle services.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Service Discovery](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_service_discovery.md)

**Description:** The service discovery mechanism used by Mantle (e.g., Consul, etcd) lacks proper authentication and authorization, allowing unauthorized access and manipulation.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle integrates with service discovery to locate and communicate with other services. If the discovery platform is insecure, and Mantle is configured to use it without additional security measures, Mantle inherits this vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Consul UI or API and registers a malicious service with the same name as a legitimate one, causing traffic from Mantle services to be routed to the attacker's service.

**Impact:** Service disruption, redirection of sensitive data, potential for remote code execution if the malicious service exploits vulnerabilities in connecting Mantle services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement authentication and authorization for the service discovery mechanism (e.g., Consul ACLs, etcd RBAC) that Mantle interacts with.
*   Secure the network access to the service discovery infrastructure used by Mantle.
*   Regularly audit the registered services and access controls within the service discovery platform used by Mantle.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal gRPC Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_grpc_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Internal gRPC endpoints, intended for communication within the microservice architecture, are inadvertently exposed to the public internet without proper authentication.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle defines and exposes gRPC endpoints for its services. Misconfiguration in the Mantle service definition or lack of network segmentation can lead to public exposure of these Mantle-defined endpoints.

**Example:** An attacker discovers a publicly accessible gRPC endpoint defined within a Mantle service and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in its methods.

**Impact:** Direct access to internal functionalities, potential for data breaches, service disruption, and remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure proper network segmentation to isolate internal Mantle services.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all gRPC endpoints defined within Mantle services, even internal ones.
*   Use firewalls and network policies to restrict access to internal Mantle services.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data via Protobuf](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_via_protobuf.md)

**Description:** Services deserialize Protocol Buffer messages from untrusted sources, potentially leading to vulnerabilities if the protobuf library has flaws or if custom deserialization logic is insecure.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle uses Protocol Buffers for message serialization and deserialization in gRPC communication between Mantle services.

**Example:** A compromised Mantle service sends a specially crafted protobuf message to another Mantle service, exploiting a vulnerability in the protobuf deserialization process and potentially leading to remote code execution within the receiving Mantle service.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, service compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Protocol Buffer library used by Mantle updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid deserializing data from completely untrusted sources within Mantle services if possible.
*   Implement input validation on deserialized data within Mantle services to ensure it conforms to expected formats and constraints.
