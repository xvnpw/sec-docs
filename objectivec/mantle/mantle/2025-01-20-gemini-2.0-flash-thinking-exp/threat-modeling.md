# Threat Model Analysis for mantle/mantle

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Mantle Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_mantle_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit a flaw *within Mantle's* authentication logic (e.g., a logic error in password verification *within Mantle's code*, a vulnerability in token handling *implemented by Mantle*) to gain access to the application without providing valid credentials. They might craft malicious requests or manipulate authentication tokens *in a way that exploits a Mantle flaw*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential data breaches, and the ability to perform actions as a legitimate user.

**Affected Mantle Component:** Authentication Middleware, Password Verification Function, Token Generation/Verification.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Mantle updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Thoroughly review Mantle's security advisories and apply recommended fixes.
* Consider independent security audits of Mantle's authentication implementation.

## Threat: [Authorization Flaw Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/authorization_flaw_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability *in Mantle's* role-based access control (RBAC) or permission management to gain access to resources or functionalities they are not authorized to use. This might involve manipulating user roles or permissions *through a Mantle vulnerability*, or exploiting flaws in the authorization enforcement logic *within Mantle*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform administrative actions, and potential compromise of the entire application.

**Affected Mantle Component:** Authorization Middleware, Role/Permission Management Module, Access Control Decision Function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully define and test all roles and permissions within Mantle.
* Ensure the principle of least privilege is enforced *in Mantle's configuration*.
* Regularly audit user roles and permissions *as managed by Mantle*.
* Implement thorough testing of authorization logic for different user roles, focusing on how Mantle enforces these rules.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking due to Insecure Session Management *in Mantle*](./threats/session_hijacking_due_to_insecure_session_management_in_mantle.md)

**Description:** An attacker might intercept or steal a valid user session ID *managed by Mantle*. This could be due to weaknesses *in Mantle's session handling mechanisms* (e.g., predictable session IDs, insecure storage). Once the session ID is obtained, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, ability to perform actions on behalf of the user, and potential data theft.

**Affected Mantle Component:** Session Management Middleware, Session ID Generation, Session Storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Mantle uses secure session ID generation (cryptographically random).
* Configure Mantle to use HTTP-only and Secure flags for session cookies.
* Implement appropriate session timeouts *within Mantle's configuration*.
* Consider the session storage mechanisms used by Mantle and ensure they are secure.

## Threat: [Insecure Credential Storage *by Mantle*](./threats/insecure_credential_storage_by_mantle.md)

**Description:** If Mantle is responsible for storing user credentials (e.g., for password resets or API keys), an attacker could gain access to these credentials if Mantle uses weak hashing algorithms, stores them in plaintext, or has vulnerabilities in its storage mechanisms.

**Impact:** Mass compromise of user accounts, ability to impersonate users, and potential access to sensitive data protected by those credentials.

**Affected Mantle Component:** User Management Module, Credential Storage Function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Mantle uses strong, industry-standard password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
* Use salting for password hashing *within Mantle's credential handling*.
* If possible, avoid storing sensitive credentials directly within Mantle and leverage secure external services.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Mantle](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_mantle.md)

**Description:** Mantle relies on other libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by attackers to compromise the application *through Mantle*. Attackers might target known vulnerabilities in Mantle's dependencies.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution *within the context of the application using Mantle*.

**Affected Mantle Component:** Depends on the vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be High or Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit Mantle's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like dependency-check or Snyk.
* Keep Mantle and its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
* Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to manage dependencies.
