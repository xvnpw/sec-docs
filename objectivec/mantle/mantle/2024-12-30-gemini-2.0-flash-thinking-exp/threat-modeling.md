Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the Mantle library:

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Property Mapping Leading to Data Exposure
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit incomplete or incorrect property mapping in Mantle models. By manipulating data on the backend, they could cause sensitive information to be omitted during mapping, preventing proper sanitization or access control checks within the application. The application might then inadvertently expose this unmapped, sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential privacy violations, unauthorized access to information.
    *   **Affected Mantle Component:** `MTLModel`, `+ classForParsingJSONDictionary:`, `- initWithDictionary:error:`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all Mantle model definitions to ensure complete and accurate mapping of all relevant data fields.
        *   Implement server-side validation to prevent unexpected or malicious data from being sent to the application.
        *   Consider using a schema validation library on the client-side as an additional layer of defense.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Property Transformers
    *   **Description:** An attacker could target vulnerabilities within custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations. If a transformer contains flaws like improper input validation, insecure deserialization, or logic errors, an attacker could craft malicious data that, when processed by the transformer, leads to code execution, data corruption, or other security breaches.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Mantle Component:** `MTLValueTransformer`, custom transformer implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat custom transformers as security-sensitive code.
        *   Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within custom transformers.
        *   Avoid insecure deserialization techniques within transformers.
        *   Conduct regular security reviews and testing of custom transformer logic.
        *   Consider using well-vetted and established libraries for common transformation tasks instead of writing custom code.

*   **Threat:** Data Injection via Unsanitized Model Properties in UI Binding
    *   **Description:** If the application directly binds UI elements to properties of Mantle models without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious data into the backend that, when mapped to the model, is rendered directly in the UI. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the UI is web-based or other injection attacks if the UI framework is susceptible.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), UI manipulation, potential for session hijacking or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Affected Mantle Component:** `MTLModel`, property getters, application's UI binding logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and encode data retrieved from Mantle models before displaying it in the UI.
        *   Use appropriate escaping mechanisms provided by the UI framework to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) if the UI is web-based.
