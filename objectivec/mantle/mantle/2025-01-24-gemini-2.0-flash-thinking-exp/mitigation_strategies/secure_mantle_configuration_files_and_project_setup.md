It emphasizes the importance of implementing robust input validation to sanitize and validate any data received from users or external sources before it is used in Mantle's build or deployment processes.

*   **Security Benefits:**
    *   **Prevention of Injection Attacks (Medium Impact):** Input validation is a fundamental security practice that effectively prevents various injection attacks, such as command injection, path traversal, and code injection, which could compromise the build or deployment environment.
    *   **Improved System Stability and Reliability:**  Validating inputs can also prevent unexpected behavior and errors caused by malformed or malicious input data.

*   **Implementation Steps:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points:** Analyze `Mantlefile` and custom Mantle extensions to identify all points where user input is accepted (e.g., command-line arguments, environment variables, external data sources).
    2.  **Define Validation Rules:** For each input point, define strict validation rules based on the expected data type, format, length, and allowed characters. Use whitelisting (allow known good inputs) rather than blacklisting (block known bad inputs) whenever possible.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic:** Implement input validation logic within `Mantlefile` or custom extensions using Mantle's scripting capabilities or external validation libraries if necessary.
    4.  **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs. Reject invalid inputs with informative error messages and prevent further processing.
