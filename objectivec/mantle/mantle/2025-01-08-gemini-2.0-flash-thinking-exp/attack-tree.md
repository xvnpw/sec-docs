## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Mantle Exploitation **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_mantle_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal and represents the successful compromise of the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the Mantle library. Achieving this goal often involves successfully exploiting one or more of the high-risk paths outlined above.

## Attack Tree Path: [**1. Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)** **HIGH-RISK PATH**](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path.md)

* This category represents a significant risk due to the direct interaction with user-supplied data. If not handled securely, it can lead to severe consequences.

    * **1.1. Command Injection via Unsanitized Arguments (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * Attackers inject malicious commands into arguments passed to the application.
            * **1.1.1. Inject Malicious Commands into Flag Values (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                * Attackers provide malicious input as values for command-line flags, which are then used in system calls without proper sanitization.
                * Example:  `--output-file "; rm -rf /"`
            * **1.1.2. Inject Malicious Commands into Positional Arguments (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                * Attackers provide malicious input as positional arguments, which are then used in system calls without proper sanitization.
                * Example:  A filename argument like `"; cat /etc/passwd > /tmp/secrets"`

    * **1.3. Path Traversal via Unsanitized Input (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        * Attackers manipulate file paths provided as input to access or modify files outside the intended scope.
            * **1.3.1. Read Sensitive Files Outside Intended Scope (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                * Attackers use ".." sequences in file paths to navigate to parent directories and access sensitive files.
                * Example: `../../../../etc/passwd`
            * **1.3.2. Write to Arbitrary Files, Potentially Overwriting Configurations (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
                * Attackers manipulate file paths to write to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting critical configuration files or injecting malicious code.
                * Example: `/etc/cron.d/malicious_job`
