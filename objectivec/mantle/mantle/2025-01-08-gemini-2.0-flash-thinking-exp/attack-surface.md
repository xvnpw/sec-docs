# Attack Surface Analysis for mantle/mantle

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Mantle API Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_mantle_api_access.md)

**Description:** The Mantle API, used for managing deployments, scaling, and other administrative tasks, is exposed without proper authentication or authorization.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle provides an API for its management functions. If this API is not secured correctly, it becomes a direct entry point for attackers to control the application's infrastructure.

**Example:** An attacker discovers the Mantle API endpoint is publicly accessible without any authentication. They use the API to deploy a malicious container that compromises the application's data.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure. Attackers can deploy malicious code, steal data, cause denial of service, or pivot to other systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Mantle API (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS, OAuth 2.0).
* Restrict access to the Mantle API to only authorized networks and users using network policies and firewalls.
* Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious activity.
* Consider using internal networking or VPNs to limit API exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Container Images Deployed by Mantle](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_container_images_deployed_by_mantle.md)

**Description:** Mantle deploys container images that contain known vulnerabilities in their base images or application dependencies.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle's core function is deploying and managing containers. If the images it deploys are vulnerable, Mantle facilitates the introduction of these vulnerabilities into the running environment.

**Example:** Mantle deploys a container image with a vulnerable version of a common library. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain remote code execution within the container.

**Impact:** Compromise of individual container instances, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or lateral movement within the application environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a robust container image scanning process as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
* Only use trusted and verified container image registries.
* Regularly update base images and application dependencies within container images.
* Consider using image signing and verification to ensure image integrity.
* Implement runtime security measures to detect and prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Mantle Agents](./attack_surfaces/compromised_mantle_agents.md)

**Description:** The Mantle agents running on the application's hosts are compromised, allowing attackers to control the underlying infrastructure.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle relies on agents running on each host to manage containers. If these agents are compromised, the attacker gains control over the resources Mantle manages.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Mantle agent software or gains access through compromised credentials, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the host and potentially impact other containers.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the underlying host, potentially affecting all applications managed by that Mantle instance. Attackers can manipulate containers, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the underlying operating system of the hosts running Mantle agents.
* Keep the Mantle agent software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for agent communication with the Mantle control plane.
* Monitor agent activity for suspicious behavior.
* Isolate agent processes with appropriate permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deployment Pipelines Managed by Mantle](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deployment_pipelines_managed_by_mantle.md)

**Description:** The process for deploying new versions or configurations through Mantle is vulnerable to manipulation or injection of malicious code.

**How Mantle Contributes:** Mantle orchestrates deployments. If the deployment process itself is insecure, attackers can leverage Mantle's mechanisms to introduce malicious changes.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the deployment pipeline configuration and modifies it to inject a malicious container image or script during the next deployment, compromising the application.

**Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application environment, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or persistent backdoors.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the deployment pipeline infrastructure and access controls.
* Implement code review and testing processes for deployment configurations.
* Use immutable infrastructure principles where possible.
* Employ secure secret management practices for any credentials used in the deployment process.
* Implement audit logging for all deployment activities.
