# Threat Model Analysis for mantle/mantle

## Threat: [Server-Side Component Injection](./threats/server-side_component_injection.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by Mantle's server-side rendering engine, injects arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the rendered output. This involves manipulating data used within Mantle's component templates or parameters passed to Mantle's rendering functions.
*   **How:** The attacker exploits insufficient input sanitization or escaping within the Mantle application's server-side code when handling user-provided data that is subsequently used by Mantle to render components.

**Impact:**
*   **Description:** Successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, leading to actions like session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application.

**Affected Mantle Component:**
*   **Description:** Server-Side Rendering (`Render` function or similar within Mantle), Templating Engine (if applicable within Mantle's component structure), Data Binding mechanisms provided by Mantle.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate all user-provided data on the server-side *before* passing it to Mantle's rendering functions.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Utilize Mantle's built-in mechanisms for encoding output based on the context in which it will be rendered (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript strings).
    *   **Utilize Mantle's Built-in Escaping Mechanisms:** If Mantle provides specific functions or directives for escaping data during rendering, ensure they are used consistently.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the impact of successful injection even if Mantle's escaping fails.

## Threat: [Insecure WebSocket Communication](./threats/insecure_websocket_communication.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates the WebSocket communication channel that Mantle uses for client-server interaction. This could involve eavesdropping on sensitive data managed by Mantle or injecting malicious messages intended for Mantle's client-side components.
*   **How:** If Mantle's WebSocket implementation or the application's use of it does not enforce encryption (WSS) or strong authentication and authorization, an attacker on the network can intercept and modify messages.

**Impact:**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data exchanged between the server and client via Mantle's WebSocket communication could be exposed.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Attackers could modify messages sent to the client by the Mantle server, leading to incorrect UI updates or malicious actions driven by Mantle's client-side logic.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions:** If Mantle's authentication is weak, an attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate client and send unauthorized commands to the Mantle server.

**Affected Mantle Component:**
*   **Description:** WebSocket Handling Module within Mantle, Client-Server Communication Layer provided by Mantle.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Always Use WSS:** Ensure all WebSocket connections used by Mantle are established over TLS (WSS) to encrypt communication.
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication within Mantle's WebSocket Handling:** Authenticate clients connecting via WebSockets to Mantle's server-side components to verify their identity.
    *   **Implement Authorization within Mantle's Logic:** Authorize client actions based on their identity within Mantle's server-side logic to prevent unauthorized operations.
    *   **Message Integrity Checks:** Consider using message signing or encryption within Mantle's WebSocket communication to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of messages.

## Threat: [Component State Manipulation via Client](./threats/component_state_manipulation_via_client.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker manipulates client-side code or network requests to directly alter the state of Mantle components on the server without proper authorization or validation enforced by Mantle.
*   **How:** This could occur if Mantle relies solely on client-side logic to determine valid state transitions or if Mantle's server-side component state management doesn't adequately validate state updates received from the client.

**Impact:**
*   **Description:** Leads to unexpected application behavior driven by Mantle components, data corruption within Mantle's state management, or the ability to perform actions that the user is not authorized to perform through Mantle's UI.

**Affected Mantle Component:**
*   **Description:** Component State Management within Mantle, Client-Server Communication Layer used by Mantle for state updates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation of State Updates within Mantle:** Always validate state updates received from the client on the server-side within Mantle's state management logic before applying them.
    *   **Authorization Checks for State Changes within Mantle:** Implement authorization checks within Mantle's server-side code to ensure only authorized users can modify specific parts of the application state managed by Mantle.
    *   **Avoid Direct Client-Driven State Changes for Sensitive Data within Mantle:** For critical state managed by Mantle, rely on server-side logic and validated user actions rather than direct client manipulation.
