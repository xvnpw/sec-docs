# Attack Surface Analysis for mantle/mantle

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data - Property Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_-_property_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** Maliciously crafted JSON data can inject or manipulate properties of Mantle model objects during deserialization, potentially overwriting intended values and bypassing application logic.

**Mantle Contribution:** Mantle's core functionality of deserializing JSON into model objects, without inherent input validation, directly enables this attack surface when processing untrusted data.

**Example:** An application deserializes user input JSON into a `Settings` model. A malicious payload like `{"isAdmin": true, "featureFlags": ["unlocked"]}` could inject admin privileges or enable unauthorized features if the `Settings` model and subsequent application logic don't properly validate these properties after deserialization.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to features, data corruption, bypassing security controls.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Mandatory Post-Deserialization Input Validation:**  Always validate the properties of Mantle model objects *after* deserialization, especially for data from untrusted sources. Implement strict checks to ensure data conforms to expected types, ranges, and allowed values.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege in Model Design:** Design models with clear separation of concerns and restrict write access to sensitive properties. Use private setters or internal access control to prevent direct modification from deserialized data where appropriate.
*   **Immutable Models for Sensitive Data:** For models representing critical security settings or immutable data, consider using immutable model patterns to prevent any modification after initial creation, including deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data - Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_-_denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:**  Extremely large or deeply nested JSON payloads provided for Mantle deserialization can consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory), leading to application slowdown or crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Mantle Contribution:** Mantle, by design, attempts to deserialize any JSON data it receives. Without explicit limits on payload complexity, it can become a vector for DoS attacks when processing maliciously large or nested JSON.

**Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with thousands of nested arrays to an API endpoint that uses Mantle for deserialization. The application's attempt to parse this deeply nested structure exhausts server resources, making the application unresponsive to legitimate user requests.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, resource exhaustion, impacting legitimate users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Request Size and Complexity Limits:** Implement strict limits on the size and nesting depth of incoming JSON requests *before* they reach Mantle for deserialization. Reject requests exceeding predefined thresholds.
*   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement request throttling or rate limiting to mitigate DoS attempts by limiting the number of deserialization requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
*   **Background Deserialization with Timeouts:** Offload deserialization of potentially large payloads to background threads or processes with appropriate timeouts. This prevents blocking the main application thread and limits the impact of resource-intensive deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Transformer Vulnerabilities - Logic Bugs and Injection](./attack_surfaces/custom_transformer_vulnerabilities_-_logic_bugs_and_injection.md)

**Description:**  Custom property transformers in Mantle, if poorly implemented, can contain logic bugs or be vulnerable to injection attacks if they process external input without proper sanitization, leading to critical vulnerabilities.

**Mantle Contribution:** Mantle's extensibility through custom transformers allows developers to introduce their own code into the deserialization process.  If these transformers are not developed with security in mind, they become a direct attack surface within the Mantle framework.

**Example (Injection):** A custom transformer for URL strings might directly use the input string to construct a URL without proper validation. An attacker could inject a malicious URL string (e.g., `javascript:alert('XSS')`) into the JSON, which, when processed by the transformer and used in a web view, could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), depending on the transformer's functionality and the nature of the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Coding Practices for Transformers:**  Adhere to secure coding principles when developing custom transformers. Avoid common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, and injection flaws.
*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in Transformers:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input processed within custom transformers. Use appropriate encoding, escaping, and validation techniques relevant to the data type and intended use of the transformed value.
*   **Comprehensive Unit Testing for Transformers:**  Develop extensive unit tests for custom transformers, specifically focusing on boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and potential injection vectors.
*   **Security Code Reviews for Transformers:**  Mandatory security-focused code reviews for all custom transformer implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
