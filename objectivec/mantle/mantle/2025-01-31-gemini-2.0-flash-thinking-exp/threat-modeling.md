# Threat Model Analysis for mantle/mantle

## Threat: [Mantle Framework Vulnerabilities](./threats/mantle_framework_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability within the Mantle framework code itself. This could be a bug in request handling, routing, or other core functionalities provided by Mantle. Exploitation could involve crafting specific requests or inputs that trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Application-wide vulnerabilities affecting all services using the vulnerable Mantle version. Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on service instances, data breaches, or complete application compromise. The impact is critical as it affects the foundational layer of all applications built with Mantle.

**Mantle Component Affected:** Mantle Framework Core (modules, functions within Mantle library, including routing, middleware, and core utilities).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with Mantle releases and security advisories. Regularly check the Mantle project's GitHub repository and communication channels for announcements regarding security updates and patches.
* Monitor Mantle's GitHub repository for reported issues and security patches. Actively track the issue tracker and commit history to identify and understand potential vulnerabilities being addressed by the Mantle maintainers.
* Apply security patches promptly. When security updates are released for Mantle, prioritize applying these patches to your applications as quickly as possible to minimize the window of vulnerability.
* Contribute to the Mantle community by reporting potential vulnerabilities. If you discover a potential security vulnerability in Mantle, responsibly disclose it to the Mantle maintainers through their designated security channels to allow for timely remediation.
* Consider security audits of applications built with Mantle, specifically focusing on Mantle-related aspects. Engage security professionals to conduct periodic security audits of your applications, with a specific focus on the Mantle framework integration and usage to identify potential weaknesses.
