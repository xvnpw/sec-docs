## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack Goal: Compromise Mantle-Based Application [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_goal_compromise_mantle-based_application__critical_.md)

This is the ultimate objective. Success means the attacker gains unauthorized access or control over the application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Service Discovery Vulnerabilities (Mantle uses Consul/Etcd) [CRITICAL, HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_service_discovery_vulnerabilities__mantle_uses_consuletcd___critical__hr_.md)

Mantle relies heavily on service discovery (Consul or Etcd). Compromising this foundational component can have cascading effects across the entire application.
* **High-Risk Paths:**
    * **Compromise Service Registry (Consul/Etcd) [CRITICAL, HR]:** Directly attacking the service registry itself.
        * **Exploit Unauthenticated Access (default config, misconfiguration) [HR]:** If Consul/Etcd is left with default unauthenticated access, attackers can easily gain full control, manipulating service registrations and potentially redirecting traffic or causing denial of service.
        * **Exploit Known Consul/Etcd Vulnerabilities (CVEs, outdated versions) [HR]:** Outdated or vulnerable versions of Consul/Etcd can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control over the registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Inter-Service Communication Vulnerabilities (Mantle's RPC/gRPC usage) [CRITICAL, HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_inter-service_communication_vulnerabilities__mantle's_rpcgrpc_usage___critical__hr_.md)

Inter-service communication is the core of a microservices architecture like Mantle-based applications. Exploiting vulnerabilities here can lead to significant breaches.
* **High-Risk Paths:**
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Inter-Service Communication [HR]:** Intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between services.
        * **Lack of Encryption (TLS/mTLS) for Inter-Service Communication (Mantle default?) [HR]:** If TLS/mTLS is not enforced, communication is in plaintext, allowing attackers to eavesdrop and potentially modify messages.
            * **Mantle doesn't enforce TLS by default [HR]:** If Mantle's default configuration is insecure regarding TLS, developers might unknowingly deploy vulnerable applications.
            * **Application developer fails to configure TLS properly [HR]:** Even if Mantle provides TLS options, misconfiguration by developers can leave communication unencrypted.
        * **Service Impersonation [HR]:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate service to gain unauthorized access or perform actions.
            * **Lack of Mutual Authentication (mTLS) between Services [HR]:** Without mTLS, services cannot strongly verify each other's identities, making impersonation easier.
            * **Exploit Weak or Missing Service-to-Service Authentication/Authorization (Mantle's responsibility?) [HR]:** If Mantle or the application lacks robust service-to-service authentication and authorization mechanisms, impersonation and unauthorized access become possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Configuration Management Issues (Mantle's configuration loading mechanisms) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_configuration_management_issues__mantle's_configuration_loading_mechanisms___hr_.md)

Misconfigurations are a common source of vulnerabilities. Mantle's configuration handling needs to be secure.
* **High-Risk Paths:**
    * **Configuration Injection Vulnerabilities [HR]:** Injecting malicious configuration values to alter application behavior or gain control.
        * **Exploit Weak Input Validation in Configuration Parsing [HR]:** If configuration values are not properly validated, attackers can inject malicious payloads that are executed during parsing, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    * **Default/Weak Configuration Settings in Mantle [HR]:** Relying on insecure default settings provided by Mantle.
        * **Identify Insecure Default Configurations in Mantle (e.g., unauthenticated endpoints, weak security settings) [HR]:** Mantle might have default settings that are convenient for development but insecure for production.
        * **Application Developer Relies on Insecure Defaults without Hardening [HR]:** Developers might overlook the need to harden Mantle's default configurations, leaving applications vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Mantle Library Itself [CRITICAL, HR]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_mantle_library_itself__critical__hr_.md)

Vulnerabilities within the Mantle framework itself can affect all applications using it.
* **High-Risk Paths:**
    * **Known Vulnerabilities in Mantle Code (CVEs, public disclosures) [HR]:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in Mantle's codebase.
    * **Dependency Vulnerabilities in Mantle's Dependencies [HR]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries that Mantle depends on (including transitive dependencies).
