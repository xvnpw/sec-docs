# Deep Analysis: Exploit Key Path Manipulation (3.1.1) in Mantle

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability described in attack tree node 3.1.1 ("If key paths are constructed from external input, inject malicious key paths [CRITICAL]") within the context of a Mantle-based application.  This includes:

*   Identifying specific code patterns within our application that are susceptible to this vulnerability.
*   Determining the potential impact of a successful exploit on our application's data and functionality.
*   Developing concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating the vulnerability, including code examples and testing strategies.
*   Raising awareness within the development team about this specific type of attack.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the scenario where key paths used within Mantle's `MTLModel` and related classes are constructed, either wholly or partially, from external, untrusted input.  "External input" includes, but is not limited to:

*   Data received from network requests (e.g., API parameters, request bodies, headers).
*   Data read from databases or other persistent storage that could have been tampered with.
*   Data received from other applications or services via inter-process communication (IPC).
*   Data read from configuration files that could be modified by an attacker.
*   User input from UI.

This analysis *does not* cover scenarios where key paths are:

*   Hardcoded within the application.
*   Generated solely from internal, trusted data sources.
*   Already thoroughly validated and sanitized before being used with Mantle.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough review of the codebase will be conducted, searching for instances where `MTLModel`'s methods like `valueForKeyPath:`, `setValue:forKeyPath:`, `dictionaryValue`, or any custom methods that utilize key paths are used.  The focus will be on identifying where the key path argument originates.  We will use static analysis tools (e.g., linters, code search) and manual inspection.
2.  **Data Flow Analysis:** For each identified instance, we will trace the flow of data that contributes to the key path string.  This will help determine if any part of the key path originates from an untrusted source.
3.  **Exploit Scenario Development:**  For vulnerable code sections, we will develop hypothetical exploit scenarios.  This will involve crafting malicious key path inputs and predicting their impact on the application.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will assess the potential impact of each exploit scenario, considering data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  We will categorize the impact as Low, Medium, High, or Critical.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  For each vulnerability, we will propose specific mitigation strategies, prioritizing the most effective and practical solutions.  This will include code examples and testing recommendations.
6.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  The findings, exploit scenarios, impact assessments, and mitigation recommendations will be documented in this report.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.1.1

**4.1 Code Review and Data Flow Analysis Findings**

Let's assume we have the following `MTLModel` subclass:

```objectivec
// UserProfile.h
@interface UserProfile : MTLModel <MTLJSONSerializing>
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *username;
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *email;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSDictionary *settings; // Potentially sensitive settings
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL isAdmin;
@end

// UserProfile.m
@implementation UserProfile
+ (NSDictionary *)JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey {
    return @{
        @"username": @"username",
        @"email": @"email",
        @"settings": @"settings",
        @"isAdmin": @"is_admin" // Example: Different JSON key
    };
}
@end
```

And the following (vulnerable) code snippet:

```objectivec
// In a controller or service class
- (void)updateUserProfile:(NSDictionary *)data {
    UserProfile *profile = [UserProfile new]; // Or fetched from storage

    // VULNERABLE: Key path constructed from external input
    NSString *keyPathToUpdate = data[@"keyPath"];
    id newValue = data[@"value"];

    if (keyPathToUpdate && newValue) {
        [profile setValue:newValue forKeyPath:keyPathToUpdate];
    }
}
```

**Data Flow:** The `keyPathToUpdate` variable is directly derived from the `data` dictionary, which is assumed to be external input (e.g., from an API request).  This is a clear violation of the principle of never trusting external input.

**4.2 Exploit Scenario Development**

**Scenario 1: Modifying `isAdmin` Flag**

*   **Attacker Input:**
    *   `keyPath`: `"isAdmin"`
    *   `value`: `@YES` (or `true` if converted from JSON)
*   **Result:** The attacker successfully sets the `isAdmin` flag to `YES`, gaining administrative privileges.

**Scenario 2: Accessing Sensitive Settings**

*   **Attacker Input:**
    *   `keyPath`: `"settings.passwordResetToken"`
    *   `value`: `nil` (or any value)
*   **Result:**  If the `settings` dictionary contains a `passwordResetToken`, the attacker could potentially overwrite it, disrupting the password reset process.  Even if `setValue:forKeyPath:` doesn't directly expose the value, the attacker might be able to infer information or cause a denial-of-service by corrupting the settings.

**Scenario 3:  Unexpected Property Modification**

*   **Attacker Input:**
    *   `keyPath`: `"someUnexpectedProperty"`
    *   `value`: `@"someValue"`
*   **Result:**  Even if `someUnexpectedProperty` doesn't exist as a declared property, `setValue:forKeyPath:` might still attempt to set a value on the object.  This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially even memory corruption, depending on how Mantle and KVC handle this situation.  It's crucial to understand that KVC *can* create properties dynamically under certain circumstances.

**4.3 Impact Assessment**

*   **Scenario 1 (isAdmin):**  **CRITICAL**.  Gaining administrative privileges allows the attacker to control the entire application or user account.
*   **Scenario 2 (Settings):**  **HIGH**.  Accessing or modifying sensitive settings can lead to data breaches, account compromise, or denial-of-service.
*   **Scenario 3 (Unexpected Property):**  **MEDIUM to HIGH**.  The impact is less predictable but could still lead to significant disruption or vulnerabilities.

**4.4 Mitigation Recommendations**

**1.  Whitelist Allowed Key Paths:**

This is the most robust and recommended approach.  Create a strictly defined set of allowed key paths that the application can use.

```objectivec
// In the controller or service class
- (void)updateUserProfile:(NSDictionary *)data {
    UserProfile *profile = [UserProfile new]; // Or fetched from storage

    NSString *keyPathToUpdate = data[@"keyPath"];
    id newValue = data[@"value"];

    // Whitelist of allowed key paths
    NSSet *allowedKeyPaths = [NSSet setWithObjects:@"username", @"email", nil];

    if (keyPathToUpdate && newValue && [allowedKeyPaths containsObject:keyPathToUpdate]) {
        [profile setValue:newValue forKeyPath:keyPathToUpdate];
    } else {
        // Handle invalid key path (log, return error, etc.)
        NSLog(@"Invalid key path: %@", keyPathToUpdate);
    }
}
```

**2.  Safe Key Path Builder:**

If you need more dynamic key path construction, create a dedicated function or class that validates and sanitizes input before building the key path.

```objectivec
// Helper function
- (NSString *)safeKeyPathForSetting:(NSString *)settingName {
    // Validate settingName (e.g., against a whitelist, regex)
    if ([settingName isEqualToString:@"theme"] || [settingName isEqualToString:@"notifications"]) {
        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"settings.%@", settingName];
    }
    return nil; // Or throw an exception
}

// Usage
- (void)updateUserProfile:(NSDictionary *)data {
    UserProfile *profile = [UserProfile new];
    NSString *settingName = data[@"setting"];
    id newValue = data[@"value"];

    NSString *keyPath = [self safeKeyPathForSetting:settingName];
    if (keyPath && newValue) {
        [profile setValue:newValue forKeyPath:keyPath];
    }
}
```

**3.  Avoid `setValue:forKeyPath:` with Untrusted Input Entirely:**

If possible, refactor the code to avoid using `setValue:forKeyPath:` with potentially malicious input.  Instead, use direct property access or dedicated setter methods.

```objectivec
- (void)updateUserProfile:(NSDictionary *)data {
    UserProfile *profile = [UserProfile new];

    // Use direct property access
    if (data[@"username"]) {
        profile.username = data[@"username"];
    }
    if (data[@"email"]) {
        profile.email = data[@"email"];
    }
    // ... other properties ...
}
```

**4.  Input Validation and Sanitization:**

Even with the above mitigations, always validate and sanitize *all* external input.  This includes checking data types, lengths, and allowed characters.

**5.  Unit and Integration Tests:**

Write unit tests to specifically test the key path handling logic.  These tests should include:

*   Valid key paths.
*   Invalid key paths (from the whitelist perspective).
*   Key paths with unexpected characters or structures.
*   Attempts to access or modify properties that should not be accessible.

Integration tests should verify that the entire data flow, from external input to property modification, is secure.

**6.  Regular Security Audits:**

Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including key path manipulation issues.

**7.  Consider Alternatives to Key-Value Coding (KVC):** If the complexity of managing key paths securely becomes too high, consider whether a different approach to data modeling and access might be more appropriate.  For example, using explicit getter and setter methods for all properties provides a much more controlled and predictable interface.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Exploit Key Path Manipulation" vulnerability, specifically when key paths are constructed from external input, poses a significant risk to Mantle-based applications.  By understanding the vulnerability, implementing the recommended mitigations (especially whitelisting), and incorporating rigorous testing, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack.  The key takeaway is to **never trust external input** when constructing key paths and to prioritize secure coding practices throughout the application.
