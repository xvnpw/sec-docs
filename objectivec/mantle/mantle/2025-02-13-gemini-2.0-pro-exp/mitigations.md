# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mantle/mantle

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Property Type Enforcement and Validation (Mantle-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_property_type_enforcement_and_validation__mantle-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Specific Types:**  In your Mantle model (`.h` or `.m`), use precise Objective-C/Swift types (e.g., `NSInteger`, `NSString`, `NSArray<MySpecificClass *>`). Avoid `id` or overly broad types.
2.  **Override `+validationKeys`:**  Implement the `+validationKeys` class method in your model's `.m` file. Return an `NSSet` containing *only* the JSON keys your model should process.  This is a *Mantle-specific* mechanism to control input.
3.  **Implement `-validate<Key>WithError:`:** Create a `-validate<PropertyName>WithError:` method for *each* property. This is where you perform *Mantle-integrated* validation.
4.  **Type Checking within Validation:** Inside `-validate...WithError:`, use `isKindOfClass:` to check the type of the value *before* Mantle's coercion.
5.  **Business Rule Validation:** After type checking, add your application-specific validation rules.
6.  **Use `validateAndMergeValue:forKey:error:` (Optional):**  Call `[super validateAndMergeValue:&value forKey:@"propertyName" error:error]` *within* your `-validate...WithError:` method to leverage Mantle's coercion *after* your custom checks. This is a key *Mantle-specific* step.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Type Confusion Attacks (High Severity):**  Directly addresses Mantle's type coercion, preventing unexpected conversions.
*   **Data Injection (Medium to High Severity):**  `+validationKeys` and `-validate...WithError:` methods, used together, are Mantle's primary defense against injecting unwanted data.
*   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):**  Ensures valid model states, reducing errors caused by Mantle's automatic processing.

**Impact:**
*   **Type Confusion Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with comprehensive implementation).
*   **Data Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (effectiveness depends on validation rules).
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   `+validationKeys` in `BaseModel`.
*   `-validate...WithError:` for `User` model: `username`, `email`, `age`.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   `-validate...WithError:` missing for `Product` and `Order` models.
*   Stricter type checks within existing `-validate...WithError:` methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Class Instantiation (Whitelisting via Mantle)](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_class_instantiation__whitelisting_via_mantle_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Entry Points:** Find where you use Mantle to create models from JSON (e.g., `MTLJSONAdapter modelOfClass:fromJSONDictionary:error:`).
2.  **Override `+classForParsingJSONDictionary:`:**  Implement this method in your base model or individual model classes.  This is the *core Mantle mechanism* for controlling class instantiation.
3.  **Implement a Whitelist:**  Inside `+classForParsingJSONDictionary:`, *do not* use a class name directly from the JSON.  Use a key from the JSON to look up the class from a predefined whitelist (e.g., an `NSDictionary` or `if/else if` statements).
4.  **Handle Unknown Types:** If the JSON key doesn't match your whitelist, log an error, return `nil`, or return a safe default class.  *Never* instantiate an unknown class. This is crucial for preventing attacks using Mantle.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Arbitrary Class Instantiation (High Severity):**  Directly prevents attackers from using Mantle to instantiate malicious classes. This is a *Mantle-specific* threat.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of DoS attacks that exploit Mantle's class instantiation.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary Class Instantiation:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination).
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   `+classForParsingJSONDictionary:` in `BaseModel` with a whitelist.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   Review all uses of `MTLJSONAdapter` to ensure they use `BaseModel` or have their own implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Value Transformers (Mantle-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_value_transformers__mantle-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Custom Transformers:** Locate all custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations.
2.  **Review Transformer Logic:** Examine the code within each transformer, focusing on how it handles input.
3.  **Input Validation:**  Within `transformedValue:` (and `reverseTransformedValue:` if applicable), add validation *before* transformations.  This is crucial, even within a Mantle transformer.
4.  **Simplify Logic:** Refactor complex transformers to be as simple as possible.
5.  **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests, including tests with invalid, edge-case, and potentially malicious input.
6.  **Reverse Transformation:** If reverse transformation isn't needed, set `allowsReverseTransformation` to `NO`. This is a *Mantle-specific* setting to reduce the attack surface.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Manipulation (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents vulnerabilities in *Mantle transformers* from being exploited.
*   **Code Injection (Low to High Severity):**  Mitigates potential code injection if a transformer uses input in a way that could lead to it (less likely with Mantle, but good practice).
*   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Ensures transformers behave correctly, reducing errors related to Mantle's data transformation.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced (depends on validation and testing).
*   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced (generally low likelihood).
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   Basic unit tests for `DateTransformer`.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   Input validation in `DateTransformer` for invalid date strings.
*   Unit tests for `URLTransformer`.
*   Review `allowsReverseTransformation` and set to `NO` where appropriate.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Key-Value Observing (KVO) Exposure (Mantle-Related)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_key-value_observing__kvo__exposure__mantle-related_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify KVO Usage:** Find where KVO is used to observe Mantle model properties.
2.  **Avoid Direct Exposure:** Do *not* directly expose Mantle models to KVO from untrusted components.
3.  **Use a ViewModel:**  Introduce a ViewModel layer between Mantle models and observing components. The ViewModel should:
    *   Hold the Mantle model.
    *   Expose only necessary properties (often transformed).
    *   Handle KVO from the Mantle model and update its own properties.
    *   Prevent direct access to the Mantle model.
4.  **Define `+propertyKeys`:** Implement `+propertyKeys` in your Mantle model to explicitly list the properties Mantle should manage. This is a *Mantle-specific* way to limit KVC access and, indirectly, KVO exposure.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Property Modification (Medium Severity):** Prevents untrusted components from modifying Mantle model properties via KVO, bypassing validation.
*   **Information Disclosure (Low to Medium Severity):** Controls which properties are exposed, limiting potential leaks via KVO.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Property Modification:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (depends on ViewModel design).

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   `+propertyKeys` implemented in most model classes.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   Introduce ViewModels to mediate between Mantle models and UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Handling of Nested Models and Relationships (Mantle-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_handling_of_nested_models_and_relationships__mantle-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Nested Models:** Find Mantle models containing other Mantle models.
2.  **Recursive Validation:** Ensure *each* nested model has its own `+validationKeys` and `-validate<Key>WithError:` methods, applying the same strict validation. This is crucial for handling nested data processed by Mantle.
3.  **Validate Relationships:**  Validate the integrity of relationships within your `-validate...WithError:` methods (e.g., check related object types).
4.  **Limit Nesting Depth (If Possible):** Consider refactoring to reduce nesting depth. Simpler models are easier to validate.
5.  **Consider Composition:** Use composition over deep inheritance for more modular models.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid data in nested models processed by Mantle.
*   **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Ensures valid relationships between models, reducing errors in Mantle's object graph handling.
*   **Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Simplifying the model structure reduces the attack surface related to Mantle's processing.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk moderately reduced.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Risk moderately reduced (if nesting is reduced).

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   Basic validation for some nested models.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - *Needs to be filled in based on your project*)
*   Comprehensive validation for *all* nested models, including relationship validation.
*   Consider refactoring deeply nested models.
