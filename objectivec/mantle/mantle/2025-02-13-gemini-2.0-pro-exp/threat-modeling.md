## Threat: [Data Injection via Custom MTLValueTransformer](./threats/data_injection_via_custom_mtlvaluetransformer.md)

*   **Threat:**  Data Injection via Custom `MTLValueTransformer`

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that exploits a vulnerability in a custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementation.  If the transformer uses string concatenation without proper escaping, the attacker could inject SQL code (if the transformed data is used in a database query) or JavaScript code (if the transformed data is used in a web view). The attacker sends this crafted input to an endpoint that uses the vulnerable transformer.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:**  Data exfiltration, data modification, database destruction.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' browsers, session hijacking, phishing.
        *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Depending on where the transformed data is used, other injection attacks (e.g., NoSQL injection, command injection) are possible.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations (specifically, the `transformedValue:` and `reverseTransformedValue:` methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical (if the transformed data is used in security-sensitive contexts) or High (depending on the usage).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding in Transformers:**  Avoid string concatenation without proper escaping. Use parameterized queries or ORM methods that handle escaping automatically.
        *   **Input Validation (Pre-Transformation):**  Implement strict input validation *before* the data reaches the `MTLValueTransformer`.  Validate data types, lengths, and allowed characters.
        *   **Output Encoding (Post-Transformation):** If the transformed data is used in a context where injection is possible (e.g., HTML), ensure proper output encoding is applied.
        *   **Code Review:**  Mandatory code reviews for all custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations, with a focus on security.
        *   **Unit Testing:** Thoroughly test custom transformers with various inputs, including malicious ones.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via +propertyKeys](./threats/information_disclosure_via_+propertykeys.md)

*   **Threat:**  Information Disclosure via `+propertyKeys`

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a request to an API endpoint that returns a Mantle model.  If the `+propertyKeys` method of the model includes sensitive properties (e.g., internal IDs, password hashes, API keys), these properties will be included in the response, exposing them to the attacker.
    *   **Impact:**  Leakage of sensitive information, which could be used for further attacks (e.g., privilege escalation, account takeover).
    *   **Affected Component:**  `MTLModel` subclasses, specifically the `+propertyKeys` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only include properties in `+propertyKeys` that are absolutely necessary for the intended data exchange.
        *   **Review and Audit:**  Regularly review and audit the `+propertyKeys` implementation for all Mantle models.
        *   **Separate Models:**  Use different Mantle models (or subclasses) for different contexts (e.g., API responses vs. internal use).
        *   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Consider using DTOs (plain objects) instead of directly exposing Mantle models in API responses.

## Threat: [Object Injection via Deserialization](./threats/object_injection_via_deserialization.md)

*   **Threat:**  Object Injection via Deserialization

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that, when deserialized into a Mantle model, triggers unintended code execution. This is less likely with Mantle than with more general-purpose serialization libraries, but it's still a risk if custom transformers or class methods are involved, or if Mantle is used in unexpected ways. The attacker sends this payload to an endpoint that deserializes data into a Mantle model.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `MTLJSONAdapter` (specifically, the methods used for deserialization, like `modelOfClass:fromJSONDictionary:error:`), custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations, and potentially any class methods invoked during the deserialization process.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Pre-Deserialization):**  Validate *all* incoming data *before* deserialization using Mantle.  Check data types, lengths, and allowed values.  This is the primary defense.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Properties:**  Use a whitelist approach to explicitly define which properties are allowed to be set from external data during deserialization.
        *   **Avoid Unnecessary Deserialization:** If parts of the input are not needed, don't deserialize them.
        *   **Review Custom Transformers:** Carefully review any custom transformers or class methods involved in the deserialization process for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** If possible, explore alternatives to deserializing untrusted data directly into model objects.
