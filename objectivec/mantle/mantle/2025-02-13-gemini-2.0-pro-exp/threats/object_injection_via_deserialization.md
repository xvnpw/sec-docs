# Deep Analysis: Object Injection via Deserialization in Mantle

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Object Injection via Deserialization" threat within the context of a Mantle-based application.  This includes identifying specific attack vectors, assessing the likelihood and impact, and refining mitigation strategies beyond the initial threat model description.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to minimize the risk of this vulnerability.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the use of Mantle (https://github.com/mantle/mantle) for JSON serialization and deserialization.  It considers:

*   **Core Mantle Components:**  `MTLJSONAdapter`, `MTLModel`, and related classes.
*   **Custom Code:**  Custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations, class methods used in the Mantle model lifecycle (e.g., `+ (NSDictionary *)JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey`), and any custom logic interacting with deserialized data.
*   **Input Sources:**  Any endpoint or mechanism that accepts JSON data intended for deserialization into Mantle models. This includes API endpoints, message queues, or even data loaded from files if those files could be influenced by an attacker.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover general-purpose deserialization vulnerabilities outside the scope of Mantle (e.g., vulnerabilities in lower-level JSON parsing libraries).  It also assumes that the underlying Objective-C runtime and iOS/macOS security mechanisms are functioning as expected.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the Mantle library source code, focusing on deserialization methods and the handling of custom transformers.  Identify potential areas of concern.
2.  **Application Code Review:**  Analyze the *specific* application's codebase to identify how Mantle is used, paying close attention to custom transformers, class methods, and input validation practices.
3.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Based on the code reviews, brainstorm specific attack vectors that could exploit potential weaknesses.
4.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Exploration (Ethical Hacking):**  *If feasible and safe*, attempt to create a simplified PoC to demonstrate the vulnerability.  This is *not* about creating a fully exploitable attack, but rather about confirming the theoretical possibility.  This step requires extreme caution and should only be performed in a controlled, isolated environment.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Based on the findings, refine and prioritize the mitigation strategies outlined in the original threat model.
6.  **Documentation and Recommendations:**  Document the findings and provide clear, actionable recommendations to the development team.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Mantle's Deserialization Process

Mantle's `MTLJSONAdapter` is the primary component responsible for deserialization.  The key method is `modelOfClass:fromJSONDictionary:error:`.  This method performs the following steps (simplified):

1.  **Input Validation (Basic):**  Mantle performs some basic checks, such as ensuring the input is a dictionary.
2.  **Property Mapping:**  It uses the `+JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey` method (defined in the `MTLModel` subclass) to map JSON keys to model properties.
3.  **Value Transformation:**  For each property, it checks for a corresponding `MTLValueTransformer`.  If a transformer exists, it uses the transformer to convert the JSON value to the appropriate Objective-C object.
4.  **Property Setting:**  It sets the transformed value on the model instance using Key-Value Coding (KVC).
5. **Model validation:** It uses model's `+validationKeys` method to validate properties.

### 2.2 Potential Attack Vectors

While Mantle is designed to be safer than many other serialization libraries, vulnerabilities can still arise, primarily through:

*   **Malicious `MTLValueTransformer`:**  A custom `MTLValueTransformer` could contain code that is executed during deserialization.  If an attacker can influence the input to this transformer, they might be able to trigger unintended behavior.  This is the *most likely* attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A transformer designed to parse a date string might be vulnerable to format string injection if it doesn't properly validate the input.  Or, a transformer that attempts to instantiate a class based on a string from the JSON could be tricked into instantiating an unexpected class.
*   **Class Method Exploitation:**  If class methods like `+JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey` or custom validation methods have vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to exploit them by crafting a specific JSON payload.
    *   **Example:**  A poorly written `+JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey` method that dynamically constructs keys based on user input could be vulnerable.
*   **Unexpected KVC Behavior:**  While less likely, there might be edge cases where KVC itself could be exploited, especially if the model has complex relationships or uses custom setters/getters.
*   **Type Confusion:**  If the JSON data doesn't match the expected types, and the application doesn't handle this gracefully, it could lead to unexpected behavior.  For example, if a property is expected to be a number, but the JSON provides a string, a custom transformer or setter might not handle this correctly.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not object injection, a very large or deeply nested JSON payload could cause excessive memory allocation or processing time, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

### 2.3 Proof-of-Concept Exploration (Hypothetical)

Let's consider a hypothetical scenario:

```objectivec
// Custom MTLValueTransformer
@interface MyVulnerableTransformer : MTLValueTransformer
@end

@implementation MyVulnerableTransformer

+ (Class)transformedValueClass {
    return [NSString class];
}

+ (BOOL)allowsReverseTransformation {
    return NO;
}

- (id)transformedValue:(id)value {
    if ([value isKindOfClass:[NSString class]]) {
        // VULNERABLE: Executes a command based on the input string!
        system([value UTF8String]);
        return value;
    }
    return nil;
}

@end

// MTLModel subclass
@interface MyModel : MTLModel <MTLJSONSerializing>
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *command;
+ (NSDictionary *)JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey;
+ (NSValueTransformer *)commandJSONTransformer;
@end

@implementation MyModel
+ (NSDictionary *)JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey {
    return @{
        @"command": @"cmd"
    };
}

+ (NSValueTransformer *)commandJSONTransformer {
    return [MyVulnerableTransformer new];
}
@end
```

A malicious JSON payload like this:

```json
{
  "cmd": "echo 'Malicious command executed!' > /tmp/pwned"
}
```

When deserialized into `MyModel`, would trigger the `system()` call in `MyVulnerableTransformer`, executing the attacker's command.  This is a *highly simplified* example, but it illustrates the core principle.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Refinement

The original mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but we can refine them based on the analysis:

1.  **Strict Input Validation (Pre-Deserialization) - *Highest Priority*:**
    *   **Schema Validation:**  Use a JSON Schema validator *before* passing the data to Mantle.  This is the most robust approach, as it allows you to define precise constraints on the structure and content of the JSON.  Libraries like `JSONSchemaValidator` can be used.
    *   **Type and Range Checks:**  Even without a full schema, perform strict type checks (e.g., using `isKindOfClass:`) and range checks (e.g., ensuring string lengths are within limits) *before* deserialization.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions to validate string formats where appropriate (e.g., for email addresses, URLs, or other structured strings).
    *   **Reject Unknown Properties:**  Configure the deserialization process to reject any JSON properties that are not explicitly defined in the Mantle model. This prevents attackers from injecting unexpected data.

2.  **Whitelist Allowed Properties:**
    *   This is already a good practice, and it's reinforced by the analysis.  Ensure that `+JSONKeyPathsByPropertyKey` only maps the *necessary* properties.

3.  **Avoid Unnecessary Deserialization:**
    *   Reiterate this point to the development team.  If data isn't needed, don't deserialize it.

4.  **Review Custom Transformers - *Critical*:**
    *   **Code Audit:**  Perform a thorough code audit of *all* custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations.  Look for any potential vulnerabilities, such as:
        *   String formatting issues.
        *   Dynamic class instantiation based on user input.
        *   Unsafe use of system calls or file system operations.
        *   Lack of input validation within the transformer.
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Write comprehensive unit tests for custom transformers, specifically testing edge cases and malicious inputs.
    *   **Simplify:**  If possible, simplify custom transformers to reduce their complexity and attack surface.

5.  **Consider Alternatives:**
    *   If direct deserialization of untrusted data is unavoidable, explore alternative approaches, such as:
        *   **Intermediate Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):**  Deserialize the JSON into a simple DTO (a plain Objective-C object with no custom logic) first.  Then, validate the DTO and manually copy the data to the Mantle model.  This adds an extra layer of isolation.
        *   **Manual Parsing:**  In extreme cases, consider manually parsing the JSON and extracting only the required values, avoiding Mantle's deserialization mechanism altogether.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Include Mantle usage and custom transformers as a key focus area in regular security audits.

7.  **Dependency Updates:**  Keep Mantle and any related libraries up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

8.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage from a successful exploit.

9. **Denial of Service Prevention:** Implement checks to prevent excessive resource consumption during deserialization. This could involve limiting the size of the JSON payload, the depth of nesting, or the number of objects created.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Action:**
    *   Conduct a thorough code review of all custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations and any class methods involved in the deserialization process.
    *   Implement strict input validation (preferably using JSON Schema) *before* any data is passed to Mantle.

2.  **Short-Term Actions:**
    *   Write unit tests for all custom transformers, focusing on edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a mechanism to reject unknown properties during deserialization.

3.  **Long-Term Actions:**
    *   Consider using intermediate DTOs or manual parsing for high-risk data.
    *   Establish a regular schedule for security audits, including a review of Mantle usage.
    *   Stay informed about any security updates to Mantle and related libraries.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Object Injection via Deserialization" threat in the context of Mantle. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this critical vulnerability. The key takeaway is that **input validation before deserialization is paramount**, and custom transformers require extremely careful scrutiny.
