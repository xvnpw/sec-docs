## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit MTLJSONAdapter Deserialization [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_mtljsonadapter_deserialization__high_risk_.md)

**1. Exploit `MTLJSONAdapter` Deserialization [HIGH RISK]**

*   **General Description:** This branch focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Mantle processes incoming JSON data and converts it into model objects. The core issue is insufficient validation of the input JSON, allowing attackers to manipulate the deserialization process.

    *   **1.1.1 Craft JSON with incorrect class types [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:** The attacker provides JSON data where the types of values do not match the expected types of the corresponding model properties. For example, if a property is expected to be an `NSNumber`, the attacker might provide a string (`NSString`) or a dictionary (`NSDictionary`).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (without input validation), Low (with basic validation)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on how the incorrect type is subsequently used; could lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially even code execution in poorly written code that handles the unexpected type).
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (might require analyzing logs or application behavior to identify the type mismatch).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement robust input validation *before* Mantle processing, preferably using a JSON schema validator.
            *   Use Swift's strong typing to enforce type safety.
            *   If using Objective-C, be extremely cautious about type coercion and use explicit type checks.
            *   Within custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations, thoroughly validate input and output types.

    *   **1.4 Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested JSON [HIGH RISK]**

        *   **General Description:** This attack aims to overwhelm the application by providing specially crafted JSON input that exploits Mantle's deserialization process, causing it to consume excessive resources (CPU or memory).

        *   **1.4.1 Submit deeply nested JSON [CRITICAL]**

            *   **Description:** The attacker sends JSON data with many levels of nested objects or arrays.  Mantle's recursive deserialization process can consume significant stack space or memory when handling deeply nested structures.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if no depth limits are enforced)
            *   **Impact:** Medium (application crash or unresponsiveness)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (application becomes unresponsive)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Implement a limit on the maximum depth of nested JSON structures that Mantle will process.
                *   Consider using an iterative approach to JSON parsing instead of a purely recursive one, if feasible.

        *   **1.4.2 Submit large JSON payloads [CRITICAL]**

            *   **Description:** The attacker sends a very large JSON payload, potentially containing large strings, arrays, or many objects.  This can exhaust the application's memory, leading to a crash or denial of service.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if no size limits are enforced)
            *   **Impact:** Medium (application crash or unresponsiveness)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (application becomes unresponsive)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Implement a strict limit on the maximum size of incoming JSON payloads.
                *   Consider using a streaming JSON parser to process the input in chunks, rather than loading the entire payload into memory at once.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit MTLValueTransformer [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_mtlvaluetransformer__high_risk_.md)

**2. Exploit `MTLValueTransformer` [HIGH RISK]**

*   **General Description:** This branch focuses on vulnerabilities within custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations. These transformers are used to convert values between the JSON representation and the model properties, and poorly written transformers can introduce security risks.

    *   **2.3.1 Use a custom transformer to bypass security checks [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:** The attacker crafts input that, when processed by a custom `MTLValueTransformer`, circumvents intended security checks.  For example, a transformer might be designed to sanitize input, but a cleverly crafted input could bypass the sanitization logic.  Or, a transformer might inadvertently expose sensitive data that should have been filtered out.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (this would be a design flaw in the transformer and its interaction with the security model)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on the specific security check that is bypassed; could lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or other security breaches)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (requires understanding the transformer's logic and the application's security mechanisms)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (requires careful code review and potentially dynamic analysis to understand how the transformer interacts with security controls)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Thoroughly review and audit all custom `MTLValueTransformer` implementations.
            *   Ensure that transformers are pure functions with no side effects.
            *   Apply security checks *after* Mantle processing, rather than relying solely on transformers for security.
            *   Avoid complex logic within transformers; keep them as simple as possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Key Path Manipulation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_key_path_manipulation__high_risk_.md)

**3. Exploit Key Path Manipulation [HIGH RISK]**

*   **General Description:** This branch focuses on vulnerabilities related to how Mantle uses key paths to access and modify properties. If key paths are constructed from user input, attackers can potentially inject malicious key paths.

    *   **3.1.1 If key paths are constructed from external input, inject malicious key paths [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:** The attacker provides input that is used to construct a key path, and they inject a malicious key path that allows them to access or modify properties they should not have access to. This is analogous to SQL injection or path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if key paths are built from user input), Low (if key paths are hardcoded or strictly controlled)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on which properties can be accessed or modified; could lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or potentially even code execution if the attacker can manipulate properties that control application behavior)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on how the key paths are constructed and validated)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (might require analyzing logs or application behavior to identify the unauthorized access)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never construct key paths directly from untrusted input.**
            *   Use a whitelist of allowed key paths.
            *   Implement a safe key path building mechanism that validates and sanitizes input before constructing the key path.
            *   Consider using a more restrictive approach to property access, such as explicitly defining which properties can be accessed via key paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit External Representation](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_external_representation.md)

**4. Exploit External Representation**

*    **4.1.2 If external representation is used to generate output (e.g., HTML, SQL), inject malicious data to cause XSS, SQL injection, etc. [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Mantle allows for an "external representation" of a model, often a dictionary. If this representation is then used to generate output (e.g., HTML for a web page, SQL for a database query), and the output is not properly sanitized, the attacker can inject malicious data that leads to classic web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if output is not properly sanitized)
    *   **Impact:** High (XSS can lead to session hijacking, defacement, etc.; SQL injection can lead to data breaches, data modification, etc.)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (standard web vulnerability detection techniques apply)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Always sanitize and encode output appropriately for the context in which it is being used.**
        *   Use a templating engine that automatically escapes output (e.g., for HTML).
        *   Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection.
        *   This is a general web security best practice, but it's crucial when using Mantle's external representation feature.
