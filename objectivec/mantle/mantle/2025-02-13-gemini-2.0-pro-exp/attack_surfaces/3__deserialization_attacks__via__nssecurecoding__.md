# Deep Analysis: Deserialization Attack Surface (Mantle)

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the deserialization attack surface introduced by the use of Mantle and `NSSecureCoding`.  We will identify specific vulnerabilities, demonstrate exploitation scenarios, and reinforce robust mitigation strategies to prevent arbitrary code execution.  The ultimate goal is to ensure that the development team can confidently and securely use Mantle's persistence features.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface arising from the deserialization of Mantle model objects that conform to `NSSecureCoding`.  It covers:

*   The interaction between Mantle's `initWithCoder:` implementation and `NSSecureCoding`.
*   Vulnerabilities arising from improper use of `NSKeyedUnarchiver` methods.
*   Exploitation scenarios involving crafted archive payloads.
*   Best practices and mitigation techniques to prevent deserialization attacks.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other attack surfaces related to Mantle (e.g., potential issues in model transformation logic).
*   General iOS/macOS security vulnerabilities unrelated to Mantle and deserialization.
*   Attacks targeting the transport layer (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks on data transmission).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis employs a combination of techniques:

*   **Code Review:** Examination of Mantle's source code (specifically, its `initWithCoder:` implementation and related methods) to understand its behavior and potential weaknesses.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identification of known deserialization vulnerabilities and how they apply to Mantle's context.
*   **Exploit Scenario Development:**  Construction of hypothetical (and potentially practical) attack scenarios to demonstrate the impact of vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** Assessment of the effectiveness of proposed mitigation techniques against identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Best Practices Definition:**  Formulation of clear, actionable guidelines for developers to follow.

### 4.1. The Threat: Deserialization and `NSSecureCoding`

Deserialization is the process of converting a serialized data stream (e.g., from a file, network connection, or pasteboard) back into an object in memory.  `NSSecureCoding` is Apple's mechanism for making this process safer than the older `NSCoding` protocol.  However, `NSSecureCoding` *itself* is not a guarantee of security; it provides *tools* for secure deserialization, but those tools must be used correctly.

The core vulnerability lies in the potential for an attacker to inject malicious objects into the serialized data.  If the application blindly deserializes this data without proper validation, the attacker's object can be instantiated, and its code (potentially within `initWithCoder:`, `awakeAfterUsingCoder:`, or other methods) can be executed.

### 4.2. Mantle's Role

Mantle simplifies model creation and persistence.  Its models often conform to `NSSecureCoding` to enable easy saving and loading.  Mantle provides a default `initWithCoder:` implementation that handles the decoding of properties.  This convenience, while beneficial, increases the attack surface if developers are not acutely aware of the risks.

### 4.3. Vulnerability Analysis:  The `decodeObjectForKey:` Pitfall

The primary vulnerability stems from using the insecure `decodeObjectForKey:` method (or similar methods without class validation) of `NSKeyedUnarchiver`.  This method does *not* check the class of the object being decoded.

**Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```objectivec
// In a custom initWithCoder: implementation (or elsewhere)
- (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        // VULNERABLE: No class validation!
        _myString = [coder decodeObjectForKey:@"myStringKey"];
        _myNumber = [coder decodeObjectForKey:@"myNumberKey"];
    }
    return self;
}
```

An attacker could craft an archive that, when decoded, replaces `_myString` with an instance of a malicious class (e.g., a class that executes shell commands in its initializer).

### 4.4. Exploit Scenario:  Crafting a Malicious Archive

1.  **Attacker's Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the victim's device.

2.  **Attacker's Preparation:**
    *   Identifies a Mantle model used by the target application.
    *   Creates a malicious class (e.g., `EvilClass`) that conforms to `NSCoding` (or `NSSecureCoding`, but the attacker will bypass the secure aspects).  This class's `initWithCoder:` (or a similar method) contains the malicious payload (e.g., opening a reverse shell, downloading malware).
    *   Creates an instance of the *legitimate* Mantle model.
    *   Serializes the legitimate model to get a baseline archive.
    *   *Modifies* the serialized data, replacing the legitimate object for a key (e.g., "myStringKey") with a serialized instance of `EvilClass`.  This often involves manipulating the underlying data representation (e.g., changing class names in the archive).

3.  **Attack Delivery:** The attacker delivers the crafted archive to the application.  This could be via:
    *   A malicious file downloaded from the internet.
    *   A compromised server providing data to the app.
    *   Data injected via a compromised pasteboard.
    *   Any other mechanism that feeds data to the app's deserialization logic.

4.  **Exploitation:** The application uses `NSKeyedUnarchiver` with the vulnerable `decodeObjectForKey:` method.  The `EvilClass` instance is created, and its malicious code executes.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Reinforced)

The following strategies are *essential* to prevent deserialization attacks:

1.  **Mandatory `decodeObjectOfClass:forKey:` (or `decodeObjectOfClasses:forKey:`):**

    *   **Rule:** *Never* use `decodeObjectForKey:` or similar methods without class validation.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```objectivec
        // Correct and Secure
        _myString = [coder decodeObjectOfClass:[NSString class] forKey:@"myStringKey"];
        _myNumber = [coder decodeObjectOfClass:[NSNumber class] forKey:@"myNumberKey"];

        // For collections, use decodeObjectOfClasses:forKey:
        NSSet *allowedClasses = [NSSet setWithObjects:[NSArray class], [NSString class], nil];
        _myArray = [coder decodeObjectOfClasses:allowedClasses forKey:@"myArrayKey"];
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** This explicitly tells the unarchiver to only instantiate objects of the specified class(es).  If the archive contains an object of a different class, the unarchiver will return `nil` (and may throw an exception, depending on configuration).

2.  **Avoid Custom `initWithCoder:` (Whenever Possible):**

    *   **Rule:**  Rely on Mantle's default `initWithCoder:` implementation unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Explanation:** Mantle's implementation is designed to be secure *if* you use the correct decoding methods (see #1).  Custom implementations introduce a higher risk of error.
    *   **If Customization is Essential:**  If you *must* override `initWithCoder:`, ensure:
        *   You call `[super initWithCoder:coder]` to let Mantle handle its part.
        *   You use `decodeObjectOfClass:forKey:` (or `decodeObjectOfClasses:forKey:`) for *all* decoded properties.
        *   You perform thorough code reviews and security audits of your custom implementation.

3.  **Post-Unarchiving Validation:**

    *   **Rule:** Even after successful class-validated deserialization, validate the *values* of the object's properties.
    *   **Example:**
        ```objectivec
        _myString = [coder decodeObjectOfClass:[NSString class] forKey:@"myStringKey"];
        if (_myString != nil && ![_myString isValidString]) { // Example validation
            // Handle invalid string (e.g., log, throw exception, set to default)
            _myString = nil;
        }
        ```
    *   **Explanation:** This adds an extra layer of defense.  Even if an attacker manages to inject an object of the correct class, this validation can prevent the use of unexpected or malicious values.  This is particularly important for strings, URLs, and other data that might be used in security-sensitive operations.

4. **Consider `NSSecureUnarchiveFromDataTransformer` (for Core Data):**
    * If you are using Mantle models with Core Data, consider using `NSSecureUnarchiveFromDataTransformer`. This allows you to specify the allowed classes at the attribute level in your Core Data model.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Updates:**
    * Keep Mantle and all related dependencies up-to-date.
    * Conduct regular security audits of your codebase, focusing on deserialization logic.

### 4.6.  Developer Guidelines (Summary)

1.  **Always** use `decodeObjectOfClass:forKey:` or `decodeObjectOfClasses:forKey:` for deserialization.
2.  **Prefer** Mantle's default `initWithCoder:` implementation.
3.  **Always** perform post-unarchiving validation of property values.
4.  **Stay informed** about the latest security best practices and vulnerabilities related to deserialization.
5.  **Regularly audit** your code for potential deserialization vulnerabilities.

By following these guidelines, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of deserialization attacks and ensure the secure use of Mantle's persistence features.
