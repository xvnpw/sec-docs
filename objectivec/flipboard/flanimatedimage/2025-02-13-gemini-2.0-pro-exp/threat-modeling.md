# Threat Model Analysis for flipboard/flanimatedimage

## Threat: [Decompression Bomb / Resource Exhaustion](./threats/decompression_bomb__resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Decompression Bomb / Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious GIF (or other supported animated image format) with an extremely high compression ratio or very large dimensions/frame count. When `flanimatedimage` attempts to decode and display the image, it consumes excessive memory and/or CPU, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The attacker could deliver this image via a remote URL or embed it within application resources.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unresponsiveness, or device freeze.  Potentially impacts other applications on the device if memory exhaustion is severe.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `FLAnimatedImage`: The core class responsible for loading and managing animated images. Specifically, methods involved in image decoding and frame caching (e.g., `-initWithAnimatedGIFData:`, `-posterImage`, `-imageLazilyCachedAtIndex:`, and related internal methods).
        *   Underlying Image I/O Frameworks: `flanimatedimage` relies on iOS's Image I/O framework (part of Core Graphics). Vulnerabilities in Image I/O could be triggered.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Pre-Decoding):** Before passing data to `FLAnimatedImage`, validate the image header to check for reasonable dimensions (width, height), frame count, and overall file size. Reject images exceeding predefined limits.
        *   **Frame Limit:** Enforce a maximum number of frames allowed.
        *   **Size Limit:** Enforce a maximum file size for the animated image.
        *   **Progressive Decoding (with Limits):** If possible, use a progressive decoding approach, checking resource usage at intervals and aborting if limits are exceeded.
        *   **Background Thread:** Perform image decoding and processing on a background thread to prevent UI freezes.
        *   **Timeout:** Implement a timeout for image loading and processing.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow / Memory Corruption in Image Decoding](./threats/buffer_overflow__memory_corruption_in_image_decoding.md)

*   **Threat:** Buffer Overflow / Memory Corruption in Image Decoding

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file that exploits a buffer overflow or other memory corruption vulnerability in the image decoding logic. This could occur within `flanimatedimage`'s custom decoding code (if any) or, more likely, within the underlying iOS Image I/O framework that `flanimatedimage` utilizes. The attacker aims to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, application crash, potential privilege escalation (if the vulnerability allows escaping the application sandbox).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `FLAnimatedImage`: Methods involved in image decoding (e.g., `-initWithAnimatedGIFData:`, and related internal methods that interact with Image I/O).
        *   Underlying Image I/O Frameworks: The primary target is likely vulnerabilities within iOS's Image I/O framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing on the image decoding components, providing malformed image data to identify potential crashes and vulnerabilities.
        *   **Memory Safety Practices:** Ensure that any custom code within `flanimatedimage` (or your application's interaction with it) adheres to strict memory safety practices. Use ARC and avoid manual memory management where possible.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `flanimatedimage` and the iOS SDK up-to-date to benefit from security patches that address vulnerabilities in Image I/O.
        *   **Sandboxing:** The iOS application sandbox provides some protection, but a sufficiently severe vulnerability could allow escaping the sandbox.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review any custom code that interacts with image data.
