# Threat Model Analysis for flipboard/flanimatedimage

## Threat: [Large Frame Count Denial of Service](./threats/large_frame_count_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a GIF image with an extremely high number of frames. When the application attempts to decode and render this GIF *using `flanimatedimage`*, the excessive number of frames consumes significant CPU and memory resources *within the library*.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes slow or unresponsive due to resource exhaustion within `flanimatedimage`. In severe cases, it might crash, leading to denial of service for the user.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   GIF decoding module *within `flanimatedimage`*.
        *   Frame processing and rendering logic *of `flanimatedimage`*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a check on the number of frames *before passing the GIF data to `flanimatedimage`*. Set a maximum allowed frame count.
        *   Load and render GIFs asynchronously to prevent blocking the main application thread, mitigating the impact of resource consumption *within `flanimatedimage`*.
        *   Implement timeouts for the decoding and rendering process *performed by `flanimatedimage`*.

## Threat: [Large Image Dimensions Resource Exhaustion](./threats/large_image_dimensions_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a GIF with extremely large dimensions (width and height). When `flanimatedimage` decodes and attempts to store the frame data in memory, it consumes a significant amount of RAM *managed by the library*.
    *   **Impact:** The application's memory usage increases dramatically due to `flanimatedimage`'s memory allocation, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors and application crashes, especially on devices with limited memory.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Memory allocation *within `flanimatedimage`* for storing frame data.
        *   Image decoding module *of `flanimatedimage`*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Check the dimensions of the GIF before decoding *and before passing it to `flanimatedimage`*, rejecting images exceeding predefined limits.
        *   Scale down large GIFs before rendering them *using `flanimatedimage`*, if appropriate.
        *   Implement memory management strategies to release resources when GIFs rendered *by `flanimatedimage`* are no longer needed.
