## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via flanimatedimage](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_flanimatedimage.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate objective. It signifies gaining unauthorized control or causing significant harm to the application through vulnerabilities within the `flanimatedimage` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Image Provided to flanimatedimage](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_image_provided_to_flanimatedimage.md)

This is the fundamental prerequisite for all the high-risk attacks. The attacker needs a mechanism to feed a specially crafted image to the application that utilizes the `flanimatedimage` library. This could be through user uploads, loading from a malicious website, or other means of providing image data to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow during Decoding](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_during_decoding.md)

This critical node represents a memory corruption vulnerability that occurs when the `flanimatedimage` library writes data beyond the allocated buffer while processing image data (GIF or APNG). This can be triggered by:
    * **Craft Malformed GIF/APNG Header:**  Manipulating the header information of the image file to specify incorrect sizes or other parameters, leading to insufficient buffer allocation during decoding.
    * **Craft Malformed Frame Data:**  Providing frame data within the image that exceeds the expected or allocated buffer size for that frame, causing a write beyond the buffer boundary.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow during Dimension Calculation](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflow_during_dimension_calculation.md)

This critical node signifies a vulnerability where manipulating the image dimensions (width and height) in the image header can cause an integer overflow during calculations performed by the library. This can lead to the allocation of an undersized buffer, which can then be overflowed when image data is written into it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Format-Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/format-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node encompasses vulnerabilities inherent in the GIF and APNG image formats themselves that the `flanimatedimage` library's decoding implementation might be susceptible to.
    * **Exploit Known GIF Vulnerabilities (e.g., LZW compression issues):**  Leveraging known weaknesses in the GIF format, such as vulnerabilities in the LZW compression algorithm, to craft images that can cause memory corruption or other exploitable conditions during decoding.
    * **Exploit Known APNG Vulnerabilities (e.g., Chunk handling issues):**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the APNG format, such as issues with how specific chunks are handled or parsed, to create malicious images that can trigger exploitable behavior in the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Heap Overflow during Image Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/heap_overflow_during_image_data_handling.md)

This critical node represents a memory corruption vulnerability occurring on the heap. By providing a malformed image, an attacker can trigger the `flanimatedimage` library to allocate an insufficient amount of memory on the heap to store the image data. Subsequently, when the library attempts to write the image data, it overflows the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use-After-Free Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/use-after-free_vulnerability.md)

This critical node signifies a memory corruption vulnerability that arises when the `flanimatedimage` library attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can occur due to logic errors or race conditions in the library's memory management. An attacker can trigger the premature release of image data and then subsequently cause the library to access that freed memory, leading to crashes or potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

This path represents the collective risk associated with vulnerabilities in how `flanimatedimage` decodes and interprets the image data. Buffer overflows, integer overflows, and format-specific vulnerabilities all fall under this high-risk category due to their potential for leading to Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Management Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_management_issues.md)

This path highlights the risks associated with how `flanimatedimage` manages memory during image processing. Heap overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities are key concerns here, as they can directly lead to memory corruption and potential Remote Code Execution.
