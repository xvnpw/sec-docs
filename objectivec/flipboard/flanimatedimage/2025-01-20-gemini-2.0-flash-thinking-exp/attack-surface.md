# Attack Surface Analysis for flipboard/flanimatedimage

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Animated Image Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_animated_image_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** The library attempts to parse and decode animated image formats (GIF, APNG). Maliciously crafted images with invalid headers, incorrect metadata, or unexpected data structures can trigger vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
    *   **How flanimatedimage Contributes:** `flanimatedimage`'s core functionality is to parse these image formats. Its parsing implementation is the direct point of interaction with potentially malicious data.
    *   **Example:** Providing a GIF file with an intentionally corrupted logical screen descriptor or frame header.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application crash or unexpected behavior.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption during parsing.
        *   Potentially, in less likely scenarios, memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be exploited for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate the source and basic integrity of the image file *before* passing it to `flanimatedimage`. This might involve checking file signatures or basic header information at a higher level.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around the image loading and decoding process specifically for `flanimatedimage`. Catch exceptions or errors thrown by the library and handle them gracefully, preventing application crashes.
        *   **Library Updates:** Keep `flanimatedimage` updated to the latest version. Security vulnerabilities in parsing logic are often discovered and patched in newer releases.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Large/Complex Animations](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_largecomplex_animations.md)

*   **Description:** Displaying extremely large or complex animated images (high resolution, many frames, long duration) can consume significant system resources (CPU, memory).
    *   **How flanimatedimage Contributes:** `flanimatedimage` is responsible for decoding and managing the frames of the animation in memory for rendering. It directly handles the potentially large data associated with complex animations.
    *   **Example:** Loading a GIF with thousands of frames or extremely high resolution, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash due to memory exhaustion within `flanimatedimage`'s processing.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) by making the application unresponsive due to `flanimatedimage` consuming excessive resources.
        *   Application crashes due to out-of-memory errors within `flanimatedimage`'s memory management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Size Limits:** Implement limits on the maximum dimensions, frame count, or file size of animated images that the application will process *before* attempting to load them with `flanimatedimage`.
        *   **Resource Management:** Monitor resource usage when displaying animations using `flanimatedimage` and implement mechanisms to prevent excessive consumption. This might involve limiting the number of concurrent animations handled by `flanimatedimage`.
