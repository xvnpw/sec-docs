## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using flanimatedimage](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_flanimatedimage.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE: Malicious Image Input**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_malicious_image_input.md)

This is the fundamental entry point for exploiting vulnerabilities within `flanimatedimage`. An attacker provides a specially crafted animated image (GIF or APNG) to the application. The goal is to create an image that, when processed by `flanimatedimage`, triggers a vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH: Trigger Memory Corruption**](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_trigger_memory_corruption.md)

This path focuses on exploiting memory safety issues within `flanimatedimage`'s image processing logic. By providing a malformed image, an attacker aims to overwrite memory in unintended ways, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE: Overflow Buffer During Image Decoding**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_overflow_buffer_during_image_decoding.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Crafted GIF/APNG with Exceedingly Large Dimensions **(HIGH RISK)**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_crafted_gifapng_with_exceedingly_large_dimensions__high_risk_.md)

The attacker crafts an image with header information indicating extremely large dimensions. When `flanimatedimage` attempts to allocate memory based on these dimensions, or when processing pixel data, it can lead to a buffer overflow, writing data beyond the allocated buffer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Crafted GIF/APNG with Excessive Number of Frames **(HIGH RISK)**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_crafted_gifapng_with_excessive_number_of_frames__high_risk_.md)

An image with a very large number of frames can exhaust memory resources during allocation or processing. If the library doesn't handle this correctly, it can lead to a buffer overflow when storing or manipulating frame data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Crafted GIF/APNG with Malformed Header Data **(HIGH RISK)**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_crafted_gifapng_with_malformed_header_data__high_risk_.md)

A malformed header can cause incorrect calculations of buffer sizes or lead to unexpected parsing behavior. This can result in writing data to incorrect memory locations, causing a buffer overflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE: Heap Overflow During Frame Processing**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_heap_overflow_during_frame_processing.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Crafted GIF/APNG with Malformed Frame Data Causing Out-of-Bounds Write **(HIGH RISK)**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_crafted_gifapng_with_malformed_frame_data_causing_out-of-bounds_write__high_risk_.md)

Within the individual frame data of the animated image, the attacker includes malformed data that, when processed by `flanimatedimage`, causes the library to write data beyond the bounds of an allocated heap buffer. This can overwrite critical data structures or executable code.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH: Denial of Service (DoS)**](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

The attacker aims to make the application unavailable or unresponsive by overwhelming its resources. This is achieved by providing images that consume excessive CPU or memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide GIF/APNG with Extremely Large Dimensions **(HIGH RISK)**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_gifapng_with_extremely_large_dimensions__high_risk_.md)

Submitting an image with very large dimensions forces the application to allocate a significant amount of memory for its representation. Repeated requests with such images can quickly exhaust available memory, leading to crashes or slowdowns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide GIF/APNG with a Very High Number of Frames **(HIGH RISK)**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_gifapng_with_a_very_high_number_of_frames__high_risk_.md)

Processing a large number of frames requires significant CPU time for decoding and rendering. An attacker can submit an image with an excessive number of frames to overload the CPU, making the application unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [**HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries**](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries.md)

`flanimatedimage` relies on other libraries (like `libgif` or `libpng`) for image decoding. If these underlying libraries have known vulnerabilities, a crafted image can trigger these vulnerabilities through `flanimatedimage`.

## Attack Tree Path: [**CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Image Decoding Libraries Used by flanimatedimage (e.g., libgif, libpng)**](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_image_decoding_libraries_used_by_flanimatedimage__e__95488ef3.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Crafted GIF/APNG Triggering Vulnerabilities in These Libraries **(HIGH RISK)**](./attack_tree_paths/provide_crafted_gifapng_triggering_vulnerabilities_in_these_libraries__high_risk_.md)

The attacker crafts an image specifically designed to exploit a known vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or format string bug) in the underlying image decoding library used by `flanimatedimage`. When `flanimatedimage` uses the vulnerable library to process this image, the vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to remote code execution or a crash.
