## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Image Parsing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_image_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This is the highest risk area. `flanimatedimage` must parse potentially untrusted GIF and APNG image files. Flaws in the parsing logic can lead to various vulnerabilities.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **1.1. Malformed GIF/APNG Input [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Crafting images that deviate from the standard format to exploit parser weaknesses.
        *   **1.1.1. Trigger Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Exploiting insufficient buffer size checks during parsing.
            *   **1.1.1.1. Provide GIF/APNG with oversized headers/chunks exceeding buffer limits:**  Manipulating header or chunk size fields to be larger than expected, causing out-of-bounds writes when the parser attempts to read or store this data.
        *   **1.1.2. Trigger Integer Overflow/Underflow [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Exploiting integer arithmetic vulnerabilities in size calculations.
            *   **1.1.2.1. Provide GIF/APNG with large size parameters leading to integer overflow in memory allocation:**  Providing very large values for image dimensions or frame sizes that, when used in memory allocation calculations, result in an integer overflow, leading to a smaller buffer than expected and subsequent buffer overflows.
        *   **1.1.3. Trigger Logic Errors in Parser [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Exploiting flaws in the parser's state machine or logic.
            *   **1.1.3.1. Provide GIF/APNG with invalid format flags causing parser to enter unexpected states:** Setting contradictory or invalid format flags that confuse the parser and cause it to enter an incorrect state, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
            *   **1.1.3.2. Provide GIF/APNG with inconsistent data across frames leading to parsing inconsistencies:** Creating multi-frame images where data is inconsistent between frames (e.g., palette changes, dimensions) in a way that the parser does not handle correctly, leading to errors.
        *   **1.1.4. Trigger Resource Exhaustion during Parsing [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Crafting images that consume excessive resources during the parsing process.
            *   **1.1.4.1. Provide GIF/APNG with extremely large number of frames causing excessive processing time:** Creating images with a very large number of frames, forcing the parser to spend excessive CPU time processing them, leading to Denial of Service.
            *   **1.1.4.2. Provide GIF/APNG with highly complex frame structures causing CPU intensive parsing:** Creating images with complex frame structures or compression that are computationally expensive to parse, leading to Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Rendering Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - Resource Exhaustion]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_rendering_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** While less likely to be direct vulnerabilities *in* `flanimatedimage`, crafted images can trigger resource exhaustion during the rendering process handled by underlying iOS APIs.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **2.2. Trigger Resource Exhaustion during Rendering [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Creating images that demand excessive resources from the rendering engine.
        *   **2.2.1. Provide GIF/APNG with very large frame dimensions causing excessive memory usage during rendering:** Creating images with extremely large frame dimensions, requiring excessive memory to store textures and render, leading to memory exhaustion and potential crashes.
        *   **2.2.2. Provide GIF/APNG with very high frame rate causing excessive CPU usage during rendering:** Creating images with a very high frame rate, demanding excessive CPU and GPU resources to render smoothly, leading to performance degradation and Denial of Service.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Logic/Implementation Flaws in flanimatedimage Code [CRITICAL NODE - DoS & Memory Leaks]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_logicimplementation_flaws_in_flanimatedimage_code__critical_node_-_dos_&_memory_leaks_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in the library's own code logic, beyond parsing, such as resource management and error handling.
*   **Focus Areas:**
    *   **3.2. Memory Leaks due to Improper Resource Management [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Flaws in how `flanimatedimage` manages memory for decoded frames and cached data.
        *   **3.2.1. Provide a sequence of GIFs/APNGs that trigger memory leaks in frame caching or decoding:** Repeatedly loading and unloading animated images in a way that causes `flanimatedimage` to leak memory, eventually leading to application slowdown or crashes due to memory exhaustion over time.
    *   **3.3. Denial of Service via Unexpected Input Handling [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Input that triggers unhandled errors or exceptions within the library's logic.
        *   **3.3.2. Provide input that triggers unhandled exceptions leading to application crashes:** Providing specific GIF/APNG inputs that cause `flanimatedimage` to throw exceptions that are not properly caught and handled by the application, leading to application crashes.
