# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `flanimatedimage`, is an iOS library designed to efficiently display animated GIF and WebP images within iOS applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enhance user experience in iOS applications by enabling smooth and performant display of animated images.
  - Improve application visual appeal and engagement through rich media content.
  - Optimize resource utilization (memory, CPU) when handling animated images, contributing to better application performance and battery life.
  - Provide a robust and reliable solution for developers to integrate animated image support into their iOS projects.

- Business Risks:
  - Library defects or bugs could lead to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or visual glitches, negatively impacting user experience and application reputation.
  - Performance issues within the library, such as memory leaks or CPU intensive operations, could degrade application performance and user satisfaction.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library, although less likely for a client-side image rendering library, could potentially be exploited if the library processes untrusted image data.
  - Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates could lead to compatibility issues with newer iOS versions or image formats, requiring application developers to find alternative solutions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Dependency management is likely handled through CocoaPods or similar, which provides a degree of dependency version control. Implemented: Project build configuration (e.g., Podfile).
  - security control: Standard iOS security features are in place for applications using this library, such as sandboxing and code signing. Implemented: iOS operating system and application development environment.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on open-source library implies a degree of trust in the library developers and community for security and maintenance.
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities within the library code, requiring timely updates and patches.
  - accepted risk: Risk of denial-of-service or resource exhaustion if the library is used to process extremely large or malformed animated images.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `flanimatedimage` during development and updates.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan the Objective-C code for potential security flaws.
  - security control: Conduct regular code reviews, including security-focused reviews, to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities or coding best practice violations.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. This is a client-side library and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. This library does not enforce authorization. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using the library.
  - Input Validation:
    - security requirement: The library should perform robust input validation on image data (GIF and WebP) to prevent processing of malformed or malicious image files that could lead to crashes or vulnerabilities. Validation should include format checks, size limits, and sanity checks on image metadata.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. This library is primarily focused on image rendering and does not require cryptographic operations. If image loading involves HTTPS, that is handled by the iOS networking stack, not this library directly.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Displaying animated images within iOS applications to enhance user experience and visual appeal.
  - Maintaining application performance and stability when handling animated images.

- Data to Protect:
  - Image data (GIF, WebP): Sensitivity is generally low as these are typically public images. However, integrity and availability are important to ensure proper application functionality and user experience.
  - Source code of the `flanimatedimage` library: Sensitivity is moderate. Confidentiality is less critical as it is open-source, but integrity and availability are important for maintaining the project and preventing malicious modifications.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any specific use cases where `flanimatedimage` is used to display sensitive or user-generated animated images? (Assumption: Primarily used for displaying general-purpose, non-sensitive animated images).
  - What is the process for reporting and patching vulnerabilities in `flanimatedimage`? (Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability reporting and patching process through GitHub).
  - Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints for applications using `flanimatedimage`? (Assumption: Performance is a key consideration, and the library is designed for efficient animation rendering).
  - Is there a formal security testing process in place for `flanimatedimage` beyond community review? (Assumption: Security testing relies primarily on community review and standard development practices, with potential for optional SAST integration).

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to enhance user experience in iOS applications through efficient animated image display. Performance and reliability are key business priorities.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security risks are relatively low for a client-side image rendering library. Focus is on input validation to prevent crashes and basic secure development practices. The library does not handle sensitive data or authentication/authorization.
  - DESIGN: The library is designed as a self-contained component within iOS applications. Deployment is standard iOS application deployment through the App Store or enterprise distribution. Build process follows typical iOS development workflows, potentially incorporating CI/CD and dependency management.
