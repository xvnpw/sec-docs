# Threat Model Analysis for flipboard/flanimatedimage

## Threat: [Malicious GIF/APNG Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_gifapng_parsing_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted GIF or APNG image. When `flanimatedimage` parses this malicious file, it triggers a vulnerability in the image decoding logic. This could be delivered through websites displaying attacker-controlled images or via user-uploaded content. Exploitation could involve triggering specific parsing paths within `flanimatedimage` that are vulnerable to buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues.

* **Impact:**
    * **Memory Corruption:** Parsing errors lead to critical memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or heap overflows. This can be exploited to overwrite critical data structures or program code in memory.
    * **Potential Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities could allow a sophisticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device. This grants the attacker full control over the application and potentially the device itself.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malformed image could cause a critical parsing error leading to immediate application crash or hang, effectively denying service.

* **Affected Component:** Image Decoding Module (specifically the core GIF and APNG parsing functions within `flanimatedimage`).

* **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical**. The potential for code execution elevates this to a critical risk in worst-case scenarios. Even without code execution, memory corruption and DoS are severe impacts.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Critical: Keep `flanimatedimage` Updated:** Immediately update to the latest version of `flanimatedimage`. Security patches for parsing vulnerabilities are critical and are often addressed in library updates. Monitor the `flanimatedimage` repository and security advisories for updates.
    * **Sandboxing (Advanced, High Security Environments):** For applications handling untrusted image sources and requiring very high security, consider isolating the image decoding process within a secure sandbox or separate process. This limits the damage if a parsing vulnerability is exploited.
    * **Strict Input Validation (Limited but Recommended):** While format-specific parsing vulnerabilities are hard to prevent with generic input validation, implement basic checks like file size limits and rudimentary header validation before passing images to `flanimatedimage`. This offers a minimal layer of defense against trivially malicious files, but is not a primary mitigation for sophisticated attacks. Focus on keeping the library updated as the primary defense.
