# Threat Model Analysis for facebookarchive/three20

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Network Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_network_communication.md)

* **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic facilitated by Three20's networking components. This occurs because Three20 might not enforce strict certificate validation or the application uses it to make requests over insecure protocols. The attacker can eavesdrop on or modify sensitive data transmitted through `TTURLRequest`, `TTURLJSONResponse`, or `TTURLImageRequest`.
* **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, leading to identity theft, financial loss, or privacy breaches. Manipulation of data can compromise application functionality.
* **Affected Three20 Component:** `TTURLRequest`, `TTURLJSONResponse`, `TTURLImageRequest` (components handling network requests).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement certificate pinning to explicitly trust specific certificates. Ensure proper validation of server certificates within the application's network handling logic (as Three20 might not enforce it strictly). Enforce HTTPS for all network communication initiated by Three20 components. Consider replacing Three20's networking features with more secure alternatives like `URLSession`.

## Threat: [Insecure Local Data Storage via Caching](./threats/insecure_local_data_storage_via_caching.md)

* **Description:** The application relies on Three20's caching mechanisms (`TTURLCache`, `TTPhotoCache`) to store sensitive data locally without proper encryption. An attacker gaining access to the device's file system can retrieve this unencrypted data.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potentially leading to identity theft, privacy violations, or other security breaches.
* **Affected Three20 Component:** `TTURLCache`, `TTPhotoCache`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid storing sensitive data in Three20's caches. If caching is necessary, encrypt the data before it is stored using iOS provided APIs like `Data Protection`. Do not rely on Three20 for secure storage of confidential information.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Image Decoding](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_image_decoding.md)

* **Description:** A specially crafted malicious image is loaded using Three20's image handling components (`TTImageView`, `TTURLImageRequest`). Vulnerabilities in the underlying image processing libraries used by Three20 could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.
* **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application or the device.
* **Affected Three20 Component:** `TTImageView`, `TTURLImageRequest`, potentially underlying image decoding libraries utilized by Three20.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid relying on Three20's image handling if possible. Validate image headers and file types before processing them with Three20. Consider using more modern and actively maintained image loading libraries. Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes due to malformed images.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web Views](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_web_views.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses Three20's `TTWebView` to display external web content without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the displayed content. These scripts can then execute in the context of the web view, potentially stealing user data or performing unauthorized actions within the application's scope.
* **Impact:** Exposure of user data, session hijacking, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user within the web view context.
* **Affected Three20 Component:** `TTWebView`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid displaying untrusted web content within `TTWebView`. If necessary, implement strict content security policies (CSP). Sanitize any external content before displaying it in the web view. Consider alternative ways to display web content that offer better security controls.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Transit due to Insecure Protocols](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_transit_due_to_insecure_protocols.md)

* **Description:** The application uses Three20's networking features to communicate with backend servers using insecure protocols like HTTP instead of HTTPS. This is a direct consequence of using `TTURLRequest` or related components without enforcing secure connections. Attackers can eavesdrop on the communication and intercept sensitive data.
* **Impact:** Confidential data can be exposed, leading to identity theft, financial loss, or privacy breaches.
* **Affected Three20 Component:** `TTURLRequest`, `TTURLJSONResponse`, `TTURLImageRequest` (components initiating network requests).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce HTTPS for all network communication initiated by Three20 components. Disable support for insecure protocols within the application's network configuration. Migrate to modern networking libraries that enforce secure communication by default.

## Threat: [Use of Deprecated or Vulnerable Underlying Libraries](./threats/use_of_deprecated_or_vulnerable_underlying_libraries.md)

* **Description:** Three20, being an archived library, may rely on older versions of system libraries or third-party libraries that have known security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities within Three20's dependencies can be exploited by attackers targeting the application.
* **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in the underlying library, potentially including arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
* **Affected Three20 Component:** Potentially all components, depending on the vulnerable underlying library used by Three20.
* **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Identify and assess the risk of using outdated dependencies within Three20. The most effective mitigation is to migrate away from Three20 entirely. If migration is not immediately feasible, carefully review the known vulnerabilities of the libraries Three20 depends on and consider if any mitigations can be applied at the application level.

## Threat: [Lack of Security Updates for Newly Discovered Vulnerabilities](./threats/lack_of_security_updates_for_newly_discovered_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** As Three20 is an archived project, it no longer receives security updates. Any newly discovered vulnerabilities within the Three20 codebase itself will remain unpatched, leaving applications using it permanently vulnerable.
* **Impact:** Applications remain vulnerable to known exploits targeting Three20, potentially leading to various security breaches.
* **Affected Three20 Component:** All components of the Three20 library.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:** The primary mitigation is to migrate away from Three20 to actively maintained and secure alternatives. Regularly assess the application's security posture and acknowledge the increasing risk associated with using an archived library. Implement compensating controls where possible, but recognize their limitations.
