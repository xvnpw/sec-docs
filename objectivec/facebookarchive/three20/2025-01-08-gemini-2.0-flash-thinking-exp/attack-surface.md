# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookarchive/three20

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities due to Archived Status](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_vulnerabilities_due_to_archived_status.md)

* **Description:** The Three20 library is archived and no longer receives security updates or bug fixes. This means any vulnerabilities discovered after its archival remain unaddressed.
    * **How Three20 Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By using Three20, the application inherits all its existing and future (undiscovered) vulnerabilities without any possibility of official patches from the library maintainers. This directly exposes the application to known and unknown security flaws within Three20 and its dependencies.
    * **Example:** A newly discovered critical remote code execution vulnerability in a third-party library used by Three20 (e.g., an image decoding library) will not be fixed within Three20, leaving applications using it vulnerable.
    * **Impact:** Potentially any impact depending on the nature of the unpatched vulnerability, ranging from application crashes and denial of service to remote code execution and data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Primary:** Migrate away from Three20 to a modern, actively maintained UI framework. This eliminates the dependency on the vulnerable library.
        * **Secondary (Difficult and Risky):** Attempt to manually backport security fixes from other projects or develop custom patches for Three20 (extremely challenging, resource-intensive, and requires deep understanding of the codebase, introducing potential for new errors).
        * **Code Audits:** Conduct thorough security code audits to identify and potentially mitigate *known* vulnerabilities within the application's usage of Three20. This does not address future or zero-day vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Image Decoding Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_decoding_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Three20 handles image downloading and decoding. Vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoders (e.g., for PNG, JPEG, GIF) can be exploited by serving maliciously crafted images.
    * **How Three20 Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Three20's image loading and caching mechanisms directly rely on these potentially vulnerable decoders. The library itself might not implement sufficient input validation or security checks around the image decoding process, making it susceptible to exploits in the underlying decoders.
    * **Example:** An attacker serves a specially crafted PNG image through a source used by the application's Three20 image views. This malicious image exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the PNG decoder used by Three20, leading to application crash or potentially remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential for remote code execution, potentially allowing attackers to gain control of the application or device.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Primary:** Migrate away from Three20. Modern frameworks often have better integrated and more secure image handling capabilities.
        * **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):** While validating image sources might help in some cases, it doesn't protect against vulnerabilities within the decoding process itself.
        * **Sandboxing (Complex):** Attempting to sandbox the image decoding process specifically for Three20 can be complex and might not be fully effective without modifying the library itself.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_communication.md)

* **Description:** Three20's networking components might not enforce modern security best practices for network communication, such as using the latest TLS versions or performing robust certificate validation.
    * **How Three20 Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the application relies on Three20 for making network requests, the library's lack of enforcement of strong TLS protocols or proper certificate validation directly exposes the application to man-in-the-middle attacks. Three20's implementation choices regarding networking security directly impact the application's vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and a server. Because Three20 doesn't enforce TLS 1.2 or higher or doesn't properly validate the server's certificate, the attacker can decrypt the communication, steal sensitive data, or inject malicious responses.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive user information (credentials, personal data), potential for injecting malicious content or redirecting users to phishing sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Primary:** Migrate away from Three20 and use the operating system's built-in networking libraries or a modern, secure networking framework.
        * **Force TLS Version (Potentially Difficult/Limited):**  Attempting to force the underlying networking libraries used by Three20 to use specific TLS versions might be difficult or impossible without modifying the Three20 library itself.
        * **Certificate Pinning (Complex):** Implementing certificate pinning would require understanding and potentially modifying how Three20 handles network requests and certificate validation.
