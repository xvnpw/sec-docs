# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookarchive/three20

## Attack Surface: [Outdated and Unpatched Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/outdated_and_unpatched_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The library relies on older versions of external libraries or system components that may contain known security vulnerabilities.
**Three20 Contribution:** Three20 is an archived and unmaintained project. It inherently uses dependencies that are likely outdated and no longer receive security updates. This is a direct consequence of using Three20.
**Example:** Three20 might depend on an older version of an image processing library with a known buffer overflow vulnerability. Exploiting this through a crafted image processed by Three20 could lead to remote code execution.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Primary Mitigation:** Migrate away from Three20 to actively maintained libraries or native iOS frameworks. This eliminates the risk by removing the outdated dependencies.
*   If migration is not immediately possible (highly discouraged):
    *   Identify and attempt to manually update vulnerable dependencies *within* Three20 (extremely complex, risky, and generally not feasible).
    *   Conduct rigorous security testing, specifically focusing on dependency vulnerabilities, to understand the concrete risks.

## Attack Surface: [Image Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the way Three20 processes image files, potentially leading to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or parsing errors.
**Three20 Contribution:** Three20 includes its own image loading and caching functionalities. Its image parsing code, due to its age and lack of recent security reviews, is more likely to contain vulnerabilities compared to actively maintained libraries. This is a direct vulnerability within Three20's code.
**Example:** A maliciously crafted PNG image, when loaded by Three20's image loading components, could trigger a buffer overflow in Three20's image parsing logic, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Application Crash.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Primary Mitigation:** Migrate away from Three20. Replace Three20's image handling with secure, modern image processing libraries or native iOS frameworks.
*   If migration is not immediately possible (highly discouraged):
    *   Implement robust input validation on image files *before* they are processed by Three20. However, this is a weak mitigation as vulnerabilities might exist deep within Three20's parsing logic.
    *   Consider bypassing Three20's image loading for untrusted image sources and use alternative, secure image handling methods.

## Attack Surface: [Code Quality and Bugs Due to Age](./attack_surfaces/code_quality_and_bugs_due_to_age.md)

**Description:** General vulnerabilities arising from poor coding practices, bugs, and lack of modern security considerations inherent in older, unmaintained codebases.
**Three20 Contribution:** Three20 is an old, archived project. Its codebase was developed without the benefit of modern secure coding practices and security knowledge.  The accumulation of bugs and lack of security maintenance is a direct consequence of using Three20.
**Example:** A subtle memory management bug within Three20's core code, which was not considered a security issue during development, could now be exploited using modern techniques to achieve memory corruption and potentially remote code execution. This bug is inherent to Three20's codebase.
**Impact:** Various, including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure, depending on the specific bug.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Primary Mitigation:** Migrate away from Three20.  Replacing the entire library removes the risk associated with its aging codebase.
*   If migration is not immediately possible (highly discouraged):
    *   Conduct extremely thorough and expert-level code review and security audits of the *entire* Three20 codebase. This is a very resource-intensive and complex undertaking.
    *   Use advanced static analysis tools to detect code quality issues and potential vulnerabilities within Three20's code.  However, these tools may not catch all types of vulnerabilities.
