# Threat Model Analysis for facebookarchive/three20

## Threat: [Unpatched Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/unpatched_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or newly discovered vulnerabilities *within the Three20 library code itself*. Due to the archived and unmaintained nature of Three20, these vulnerabilities will likely remain unpatched. Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or complete device compromise.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the user's device, potentially leading to full device compromise, data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.
*   **Three20 Component Affected:** Potentially any component of Three20, including but not limited to: Networking (`TTURLRequest`, `TTURLCache`), image handling (`TTImageView`, `TTThumbsViewController`), UI components (`TTTableView`, `TTNavigator`), and core utility functions. The lack of maintenance means *any* part of the library could harbor exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities) to **High** (for significant information disclosure or denial of service vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Thoroughly audit the application's usage of Three20 and the Three20 code itself to identify potential vulnerabilities *before* deployment. Focus on areas handling external data or complex logic.
    *   **Sandboxing and Isolation:**  Employ strong operating system-level sandboxing to limit the damage an attacker can do even if they exploit a Three20 vulnerability.
    *   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** Consider advanced RASP techniques to detect and potentially block exploitation attempts at runtime, although this is complex for a legacy library.
    *   **Immediate Replacement of Three20:** The *most critical mitigation* is to prioritize replacing Three20 with actively maintained and secure alternatives. This eliminates the root cause of unpatched vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation (Indirectly via Three20)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation__indirectly_via_three20_.md)

*   **Description:** Three20 relies on older versions of other libraries and frameworks.  Vulnerabilities in *these dependencies*, while not directly in Three20's code, become a threat *because* the application is using Three20 and its outdated dependencies. Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in these underlying components.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to direct Three20 vulnerabilities, exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, and device compromise, depending on the severity of the vulnerability and the affected dependency.
*   **Three20 Component Affected:** Indirectly affects all components of Three20 that rely on vulnerable dependencies.  Identifying the specific affected Three20 component requires dependency analysis.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if dependencies have known Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities) to **Medium** (if vulnerabilities are less severe, but still exploitable).  We are including this as **High** here because the *unpatched nature* in the context of Three20 elevates the risk.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Analysis and Vulnerability Scanning:**  Conduct a thorough analysis of Three20's dependencies and use vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in the specific versions used.
    *   **Vendor Patch Monitoring (for system libraries):** Monitor for security patches for system libraries that Three20 depends on, although direct patching might be limited.
    *   **Replace Three20:**  Again, the most effective mitigation is to replace Three20, which inherently removes the dependency on its outdated components.

## Threat: [Insecure HTTP Communication leading to MitM and Cache Poisoning (TTURLRequest, TTURLCache)](./threats/insecure_http_communication_leading_to_mitm_and_cache_poisoning__tturlrequest__tturlcache_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `TTURLRequest` to transmit sensitive data over unencrypted HTTP (and the application doesn't strictly enforce HTTPS *despite* using Three20), attackers can perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This allows them to intercept sensitive data and potentially inject malicious responses. If caching is enabled via `TTURLCache` for these insecure requests, the cache can be poisoned with malicious content.
*   **Impact:**  **High Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data (credentials, personal information). **Critical Impact:** Cache poisoning leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if malicious HTML/JavaScript is injected and cached, or other application logic manipulation if cached data is used for critical functions.
*   **Three20 Component Affected:** `TTURLRequest`, `TTURLCache`.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if cache poisoning leads to XSS or RCE) to **High** (if sensitive data is transmitted insecurely and is intercepted).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Enforce HTTPS:**  *Regardless of Three20's defaults*, the application *must* enforce HTTPS for *all* network communication, especially when handling sensitive data. Configure `TTURLRequest` to *only* use HTTPS URLs.
    *   **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Implement HSTS on the server-side to force clients to use HTTPS and prevent downgrade attacks.
    *   **Certificate Pinning:**  Consider certificate pinning for enhanced HTTPS security to prevent MitM attacks by validating server certificates against trusted sources.
    *   **Disable Caching of Sensitive HTTP Responses:** If HTTPS cannot be fully guaranteed for legacy reasons (highly discouraged), *never* cache responses obtained over HTTP, especially if they contain sensitive data.

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities leading to RCE or DoS (TTImageView, TTThumbsViewController)](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities_leading_to_rce_or_dos__ttimageview__ttthumbsviewcontroller_.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted images, when processed by Three20's image handling components (`TTImageView`, `TTThumbsViewController`), could exploit vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries used by Three20 or the underlying system. This could lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other vulnerabilities exploitable for Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Impact:** **Critical Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's device. **High Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) causing application crashes or instability.
*   **Three20 Component Affected:** `TTImageView`, `TTThumbsViewController`, and potentially other image-handling components within Three20.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for RCE vulnerabilities) to **High** (for DoS vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Image Type and Size):** Validate image file types and sizes to reject unexpected or excessively large files that could trigger vulnerabilities.
    *   **Image Sanitization/Re-encoding (with caution):**  Consider re-encoding images using a modern, secure image processing library *before* they are processed by Three20. However, ensure the sanitization process itself is secure and doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement strict resource limits to prevent excessive memory or CPU usage during image processing, mitigating DoS attacks.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Operating system sandboxing is crucial to limit the damage if an image processing vulnerability is exploited.
    *   **Replace Three20 Image Handling:** If image handling is a critical part of the application, consider replacing Three20's image components with modern, actively maintained libraries.
