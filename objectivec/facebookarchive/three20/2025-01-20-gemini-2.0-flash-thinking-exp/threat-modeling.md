# Threat Model Analysis for facebookarchive/three20

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack due to Lack of Strict HTTPS Enforcement](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_due_to_lack_of_strict_https_enforcement.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker positioned between the user's device and the application's server intercepts network traffic. They can eavesdrop on communication, potentially stealing sensitive data being transmitted. They might also modify the data in transit, leading to unexpected application behavior or data corruption. This is directly related to how Three20's networking components are configured and used.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality of data is compromised (e.g., user credentials, personal information). Data integrity can be violated if the attacker modifies the traffic.
    *   **Affected Three20 Component:** `TTURLRequest`, `TTURLJSONResponse`, `TTURLXMLResponse`, and potentially any custom classes using Three20's networking features. The core issue lies in the configuration and usage of these components regarding secure connections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure all network requests are made over HTTPS. Configure `TTURLRequest` and related classes to strictly use HTTPS.
        *   **Implement Certificate Pinning:**  Pin the server's SSL certificate or public key within the application to prevent MITM attacks even if a compromised Certificate Authority is involved.
        *   **Regularly Review Network Configurations:**  Ensure that no configurations inadvertently allow insecure connections.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Cached Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_cached_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the device's file system and retrieves sensitive data stored in Three20's caching mechanisms. This could include user credentials, API keys, or other confidential information that was not properly protected during caching by Three20's components.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality of sensitive data is compromised. Attackers can use this information for malicious purposes, such as account takeover or unauthorized access to services.
    *   **Affected Three20 Component:** `TTURLCache`, `TTImageView` (for cached images), and potentially any custom caching implementations built on top of Three20. The vulnerability lies in how these components store data on the file system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Encrypt Cached Data:** Encrypt sensitive data before storing it in the cache. Utilize iOS's built-in encryption capabilities (e.g., using the Keychain for credentials or File Protection for other data).
        *   **Minimize Caching of Sensitive Data:** Avoid caching sensitive information if possible. If caching is necessary, reduce the cache duration.
        *   **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure that the application's cache directory has appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access by other applications.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Image Loading and Processing](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_image_loading_and_processing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image that exploits vulnerabilities within Three20's image loading or processing functionalities. This could lead to denial-of-service (crashing the application) or, in more severe cases, potentially remote code execution if the underlying image processing libraries used by Three20 have critical flaws.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability or crashes (DoS). In severe cases, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's device.
    *   **Affected Three20 Component:** `TTImageView`, `TTURLCache` (for cached images), and potentially any internal image decoding libraries used by Three20.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update Three20 (If Possible):** While Three20 is archived, if there are any community-maintained forks with security patches, consider using them.
        *   **Sanitize Image URLs:** Ensure that image URLs are from trusted sources.
        *   **Implement Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle issues during image loading and prevent application crashes.
        *   **Consider Alternative Image Loading Libraries:** If feasible, consider replacing Three20's image loading components with more modern and actively maintained libraries.

## Threat: [Use of Outdated and Unmaintained Library](./threats/use_of_outdated_and_unmaintained_library.md)

*   **Description:**  Since Three20 is an archived project, it no longer receives security updates. This means any newly discovered vulnerabilities within the library will remain unpatched, making applications using it increasingly vulnerable over time. This directly impacts all functionalities provided by Three20.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes susceptible to known and future vulnerabilities in Three20, potentially leading to various security compromises.
    *   **Affected Three20 Component:**  All components of the Three20 library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Migrate Away from Three20:** The most effective mitigation is to migrate the application to a modern, actively maintained library or framework that provides similar functionalities. This eliminates the risk associated with using an outdated library.
        *   **Isolate Three20 Usage:** If immediate migration is not feasible, try to isolate the usage of Three20 components as much as possible to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
