# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookarchive/three20

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Flaws in how Three20 decodes and processes image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF) can lead to crashes, memory corruption, or potentially remote code execution.
    * **How Three20 Contributes:** Three20 provides classes and methods for loading and displaying images, handling the decoding process. Vulnerabilities within these components directly expose the application.
    * **Example:**  A specially crafted malicious PNG image loaded via `TTImageView` could trigger a buffer overflow in Three20's image decoding logic.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:** Validate image sources and potentially implement server-side checks before allowing images to be processed by Three20.
        * **Consider Alternative Libraries:** If feasible, replace Three20's image handling components with more modern and actively maintained libraries.
        * **Runtime Checks (Limited):** While difficult, attempt to implement runtime checks or sandboxing to limit the impact of potential memory corruption.

## Attack Surface: [General Risk of Using an Archived Library](./attack_surfaces/general_risk_of_using_an_archived_library.md)

* **Description:**  The fact that Three20 is archived means it will not receive any further security updates. Any newly discovered vulnerabilities will remain unpatched.
    * **How Three20 Contributes:**  The lack of ongoing maintenance makes the application inherently more vulnerable over time.
    * **Example:** A new critical vulnerability is discovered in a core component of Three20, and there will be no official fix available.
    * **Impact:** Increasing vulnerability to known and future exploits.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Prioritize Migration:** The most effective long-term mitigation is to migrate away from Three20 to a more actively maintained and secure alternative.
        * **Implement Robust Security Practices:**  Implement strong security practices throughout the application to mitigate the risks posed by Three20's vulnerabilities.
        * **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities related to Three20 or its dependencies.
