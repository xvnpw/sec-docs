#### 4.6. Complementary Strategies

While manual security code review is valuable, it should ideally be part of a layered security approach. Complementary strategies to consider include:

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools:**  Utilize SAST tools specialized for Objective-C to automatically scan the codebase for common vulnerability patterns, including memory management issues and potential injection points. While SAST tools might miss complex vulnerabilities, they can provide a baseline level of security and identify easily detectable issues.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools:**  If applicable, DAST tools can be used to test the running application and identify vulnerabilities in runtime behavior, including those related to `three20` components exposed through the application's interface.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Employ tools to scan the application's dependencies, including `three20` itself (if possible, though it's an in-project library), for known vulnerabilities. While `three20` is not a typical dependency in modern package managers, understanding if there are known vulnerabilities associated with its components or common usage patterns is beneficial.
*   **Runtime Error Detection and Monitoring:** Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to detect and monitor runtime errors, including memory-related errors or unexpected behavior in `three20` interactions. This can help identify potential vulnerabilities that might slip through code review and testing.
*   **Consider Migration/Replacement:**  Long-term, the most effective security strategy might be to migrate away from `three20` entirely and replace its functionality with modern, actively maintained libraries or native iOS frameworks. This eliminates the inherent risks associated with relying on a deprecated and potentially less secure library.

#### 4.7. Implementation Details Assessment

The described implementation steps in the mitigation strategy are generally sound and practical:
