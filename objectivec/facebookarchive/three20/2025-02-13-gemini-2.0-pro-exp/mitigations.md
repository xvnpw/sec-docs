# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for facebookarchive/three20

## Mitigation Strategy: [Focused Vulnerability Scanning and Static Analysis (Three20-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/focused_vulnerability_scanning_and_static_analysis__three20-specific_.md)

1.  **Identify Three20 Code:** Precisely delineate all directories and files within your project that are part of the Three20 library.
2.  **Configure Static Analysis Tools:**
    *   **SonarQube:** Create a dedicated Quality Profile *exclusively* for Three20. Scope this profile to include *only* the identified Three20 files.
    *   **Semgrep:** Develop custom rules or adapt existing Objective-C rulesets to target common vulnerability patterns. Configure Semgrep to scan *only* the Three20 directories.
    *   **Xcode Analyzer:** While you can't directly target Three20, ensure it's enabled at its highest sensitivity.
3.  **Regular, Targeted Scans:** Schedule frequent scans (e.g., nightly) using the configured tools, *specifically* targeting the Three20 codebase.
4.  **Prioritized Review (Three20 Only):** Manually review *all* warnings and errors flagged *within the Three20 code*, regardless of severity. Do not dismiss any Three20-specific findings without thorough investigation.
5.  **Document Three20 Findings:** Maintain detailed records of any findings, including vulnerability type, location within Three20, potential impact, and remediation status.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Three20 (High Severity):** Directly identifies publicly known vulnerabilities within the Three20 library itself.
        *   **Potential Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Three20 (Unknown Severity):** May help uncover previously unknown vulnerabilities specific to Three20's code.
        *   **Three20-Specific Code Quality Issues (Low-Medium Severity):** Detects code quality problems within Three20 that could be exploitable.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Three20:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known Three20 vulnerabilities.
        *   **Potential Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Three20:** Offers a *chance* of finding zero-days within Three20, but this is not guaranteed.
        *   **Three20-Specific Code Quality Issues:** Improves the overall security posture of the Three20 components used in your application.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   SonarQube scans the entire project weekly.
        *   Xcode analyzer is enabled with default settings.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No dedicated SonarQube profile for Three20. Scans are not focused.
        *   Semgrep is not used.
        *   No process for prioritized review of *only* Three20-specific warnings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Three20 Dependency Auditing and Cautious Forking](./mitigation_strategies/three20_dependency_auditing_and_cautious_forking.md)

1.  **Identify Three20's Dependencies:** Use `CocoaPods` (if used for Three20) or manually inspect Three20's project files and source code to create a *complete* list of all libraries that Three20 itself depends on.
2.  **Vulnerability Research (Three20 Dependencies):** For *each* dependency used by Three20, search for known vulnerabilities using:
    *   NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
    *   GitHub Security Advisories
    *   Relevant security blogs and mailing lists
3.  **Update (If Possible & Compatible with Three20):** If a Three20 dependency has a newer, secure version *and* that version is demonstrably compatible with Three20 (requires rigorous testing), update it.
4.  **Forking (Three20 Dependencies - Last Resort):** If a vulnerable Three20 dependency has no updates, or updates break Three20:
    *   Create a *private* fork of the dependency's repository.
    *   Apply *only* the essential security patches to the forked dependency. Avoid any other modifications.
    *   Meticulously document *every* change made in the forked dependency.
    *   Implement a comprehensive test suite specifically for the forked dependency to ensure the patch doesn't introduce new problems *and* remains compatible with Three20.
    *   Continuously monitor the original dependency for official updates. If a secure update is released, switch back to it (after thorough testing with Three20).
5. **Three20 Forking (Extreme Last Resort):** If critical security patches are needed directly within the Three20 codebase itself, and no other option exists:
    *   Create a *private* fork of the Three20 repository.
    *   Apply *only* the necessary security patches. Avoid any other changes.
    *   Meticulously document *every* change made in the forked Three20.
    *   Implement a comprehensive test suite specifically for the forked Three20 code.
    *   Continuously monitor for any community efforts or discussions related to Three20 security, although this is unlikely given its archived status.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies of Three20 (High Severity):** Directly addresses vulnerabilities in libraries that Three20 relies on, reducing the overall attack surface related to Three20's operation.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Three20 Dependencies (Medium-High Severity):** Mitigates the risk of a compromised dependency of Three20 being used as an attack vector.
        * **Vulnerabilities inside Three20 itself (High Severity):** Directly addresses vulnerabilities in Three20 library.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies of Three20:** Significantly reduces risk if vulnerable dependencies are updated or patched.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Three20 Dependencies:** Reduces the risk, but doesn't eliminate it (Three20 itself remains a potential supply chain risk).
        * **Vulnerabilities inside Three20 itself:** Significantly reduces risk if vulnerabilities are patched.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic dependency checks during builds.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No systematic vulnerability research for *Three20's* dependencies.
        *   No established forking process or documentation specifically for Three20 or its dependencies.
        *   No dedicated testing for forked dependencies or a forked Three20.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize and Review Risky Three20 Component Usage](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_and_review_risky_three20_component_usage.md)

1.  **Code Audit (Three20 Usage):** Analyze your codebase to create a precise list of *all* Three20 classes and methods that your application *actually* uses.
2.  **Risk Assessment (Three20 Components):** Categorize each used Three20 component based on its inherent risk:
    *   **High Risk:** Three20 components related to networking (`TTURLRequest`, `TTURLCache`), data persistence, and any custom URL scheme handlers built on Three20.
    *   **Medium Risk:** Three20 components that handle user input or display data (e.g., `TTTableViewController`, `TTTextEditor`).
    *   **Low Risk:** Three20 utility classes or components with limited functionality and no direct external interaction.
3.  **Prioritize Replacement (Focus on Three20):** Prioritize replacing *high-risk Three20 components* first. If a risky Three20 component is deemed essential, thoroughly review its *implementation within the Three20 source code* for potential security weaknesses.
4.  **Document Three20 Component Risk:** Maintain documentation of the risk assessment and replacement plan *specifically for each Three20 component*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Specific Three20 Components (Variable Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by minimizing the use of potentially vulnerable parts of the Three20 library. The severity depends on the specific Three20 component.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Specific Three20 Components:** Reduces risk proportionally to the number of risky Three20 components removed or replaced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No formal audit or risk assessment of Three20 component usage.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The entire process is missing. No analysis, prioritization, or documentation specific to Three20 components exists.
