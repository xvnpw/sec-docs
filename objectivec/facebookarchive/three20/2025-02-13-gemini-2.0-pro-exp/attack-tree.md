## Attack Tree Path: [Unintended File Access via `TTURLRequest` (Leaf 1.1.2) `[CRITICAL]`](./attack_tree_paths/unintended_file_access_via__tturlrequest___leaf_1_1_2____critical__.md)

*   **Description:** If `TTURLRequest` allows arbitrary file URLs (`file://`) and doesn't properly sanitize paths, an attacker could read arbitrary files from the filesystem. This is extremely dangerous on the server-side, potentially exposing configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data. If the attacker can write to a location that is later executed, this could lead to RCE.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depends on whether `file://` is allowed and the effectiveness of path sanitization)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Arbitrary file read is a major security breach; RCE is a worst-case scenario)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple directory traversal payloads like `../../etc/passwd` are often effective)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (File access might be logged, but the malicious intent might not be immediately obvious without careful analysis)

## Attack Tree Path: [SSRF via `TTURLRequest` (Leaf 1.1.3) `[CRITICAL]`](./attack_tree_paths/ssrf_via__tturlrequest___leaf_1_1_3____critical__.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `TTURLRequest` to make requests based on user-supplied URLs, and Three20 doesn't validate these URLs, an attacker can perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This allows the attacker to make the *server* send requests to internal resources (databases, internal APIs, cloud metadata services) or other external systems that the attacker couldn't directly access. This can expose sensitive data, internal services, and potentially lead to RCE if a vulnerable internal service is accessible.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Common vulnerability if user-supplied URLs are used without strict validation)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Access to internal networks and services; potential for RCE)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Finding a vulnerable endpoint and crafting the SSRF payload; may require some reconnaissance)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Understanding of internal network structure may be required for maximum impact)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Server logs might show unusual requests, but the attacker's IP address is masked; requires correlation of requests)

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Injection into View Controllers (Leaf 2.1.2) `[HIGH RISK]`](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_injection_into_view_controllers__leaf_2_1_2____high_risk__.md)

*   **Description:** If `TTNavigator` allows arbitrary parameters to be passed to view controllers via the URL, an attacker could inject malicious values. The impact depends entirely on how the view controller uses these parameters.  Examples include:
    *   **SQL Injection:** If a parameter is used in a database query without proper sanitization.
    *   **Command Injection:** If a parameter is used in a system command.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If a parameter is reflected back to the user without proper encoding.
    *   **Denial of Service:** If a parameter can be used to trigger excessive resource consumption.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Very common vulnerability if parameters are not validated and sanitized)
*   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (Ranges from information disclosure to RCE, depending on the specific injection type)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Crafting malicious parameter values; may require some understanding of the application's logic)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Depends on the complexity of the injection vulnerability)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Depends on the type of injection and how it's logged; may require specialized security testing)

## Attack Tree Path: [XSS in `TTTextEditor` or other text-handling components (Leaf 2.2.1) `[HIGH RISK]`](./attack_tree_paths/xss_in__tttexteditor__or_other_text-handling_components__leaf_2_2_1____high_risk__.md)

*   **Description:** If `TTTextEditor` or other components that display user-generated content don't properly sanitize input, they are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will then be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This allows the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the application, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Extremely common vulnerability if input sanitization is not implemented correctly)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Cookie theft, session hijacking, phishing, defacement)
*   **Effort:** Low (Standard XSS payloads are readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Might be visible in the browser's developer tools, but could be obfuscated; requires careful examination of rendered HTML)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting `NSCoding` or other serialization mechanisms (Leaf 3.1.1) `[CRITICAL]`](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting__nscoding__or_other_serialization_mechanisms__leaf_3_1_1____critical__.md)

*   **Description:** If Three20 uses `NSCoding` (or similar serialization mechanisms) to store or transmit data, and it deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious serialized objects. When these objects are deserialized, they can execute arbitrary code, leading directly to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is a very serious and often easily exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** High (If `NSCoding` is used with any data that could be influenced by an attacker)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE is a direct consequence, giving the attacker full control)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires crafting a malicious serialized object; "gadget chains" may be needed)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert (Requires a deep understanding of Objective-C object serialization and exploitation techniques)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Often requires static analysis to identify the use of `NSCoding` with untrusted data, or dynamic analysis with specialized tools to detect the execution of malicious code during deserialization)
