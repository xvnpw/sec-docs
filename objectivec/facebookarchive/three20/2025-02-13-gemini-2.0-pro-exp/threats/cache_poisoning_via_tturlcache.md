Okay, let's break down this cache poisoning threat in Three20's `TTURLCache`.  This is a critical analysis, especially given that Three20 is an archived project and likely contains unpatched vulnerabilities.

## Deep Analysis: Cache Poisoning via TTURLCache

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Understand the specific mechanisms by which an attacker could poison the `TTURLCache`.
*   Identify the root causes and contributing factors that make this attack possible.
*   Assess the feasibility and impact of the attack in a real-world application context.
*   Refine the existing mitigation strategies and propose additional, concrete steps to prevent or mitigate the threat.
*   Determine if the proposed mitigations are sufficient, or if a complete replacement of `TTURLCache` is necessary.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the `TTURLCache` component of the Three20 library and its interaction with `TTURLRequest`.  We will consider:

*   The caching logic and storage mechanisms used by `TTURLCache`.
*   How `TTURLRequest` interacts with the cache (fetching, storing, invalidating).
*   Potential vulnerabilities in how URLs are used as cache keys.
*   The handling of HTTP headers related to caching (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `ETag`).
*   The data serialization and deserialization processes used for cached objects.
*   The application's specific usage patterns of `TTURLCache` (what types of data are cached, how long they are cached for, etc.).  This is crucial, as the application's context heavily influences the attack surface.

We will *not* cover:

*   General network security issues (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks) unless they directly relate to `TTURLCache` poisoning.
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the Three20 library, except where they directly contribute to the cache poisoning threat.
*   Vulnerabilities in the application's code that are unrelated to `TTURLCache`.

**1.3. Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  We will examine the source code of `TTURLCache` and related classes in the Three20 library (available on GitHub, even though it's archived).  This is the most critical step. We'll look for:
    *   Missing or insufficient input validation.
    *   Improper handling of HTTP headers.
    *   Weaknesses in key generation.
    *   Insecure deserialization.
    *   Lack of integrity checks.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical):**  While we won't be setting up a live testing environment (due to the archived nature of the library and potential security risks), we will *hypothetically* describe how dynamic analysis *could* be performed. This includes:
    *   Using a proxy (like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP) to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses.
    *   Crafting malicious responses to test the cache's behavior.
    *   Monitoring the application's memory and file system for evidence of cache poisoning.
*   **Threat Modeling Refinement:** We will revisit the initial threat model and refine it based on our findings from the code review and hypothetical dynamic analysis.
*   **Best Practices Review:** We will compare the `TTURLCache` implementation against current security best practices for caching mechanisms.
*   **Documentation Review:** We will examine any available documentation for `TTURLCache` to understand its intended behavior and limitations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Potential Attack Vectors (Based on Code Review and Hypothetical Scenarios):**

Let's analyze potential attack vectors, assuming a typical usage scenario where `TTURLCache` is used to cache responses from network requests:

*   **2.1.1. Insufficient Key Validation / Key Collisions:**

    *   **Code Review Focus:** Examine how `TTURLCache` generates cache keys from URLs.  Is it a simple one-to-one mapping, or does it normalize the URL in any way?  Are query parameters included in the key?  Are they order-dependent?
    *   **Hypothetical Attack:** An attacker could craft requests with slightly different URLs (e.g., adding or reordering query parameters) that resolve to the *same* cache key.  If the server's response varies based on these parameters, the attacker could poison the cache with a response intended for a different request.
        *   Example:
            *   Legitimate request: `/api/products?id=123` (returns product details)
            *   Attacker request: `/api/products?id=123&param=malicious` (returns malicious data, but the server might still use the same base URL for caching)
        *   If `TTURLCache` only uses `/api/products?id=123` as the key, the attacker's response could overwrite the legitimate response.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Ensure the cache key includes *all* relevant parts of the URL, including query parameters, in a consistent and order-independent manner.  Consider using a cryptographic hash of the *entire* request (including headers, if relevant) as the key.

*   **2.1.2. Ignoring or Misinterpreting HTTP Cache Headers:**

    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Check how `TTURLCache` handles HTTP headers like `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `ETag`, and `Vary`. Does it correctly respect these headers to determine cache validity and freshness?  Does it handle `no-cache` and `no-store` directives properly?
    *   **Hypothetical Attack:** An attacker could manipulate the server's response headers to:
        *   Set an excessively long `Expires` value, causing malicious content to be cached for an extended period.
        *   Omit `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers, potentially leading to incorrect caching behavior.
        *   Provide a weak or predictable `ETag`, allowing the attacker to overwrite the cache entry with a different response.
        *   Exploit the `Vary` header if the server uses it to differentiate responses based on request headers (e.g., `Accept-Encoding`, `User-Agent`). The attacker could send a request with a specific header value, poison the cache for that variation, and then other users with the same header value would receive the poisoned response.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly adhere to RFC 7234 (HTTP/1.1 Caching) guidelines.  Implement robust parsing and validation of all relevant cache headers.  Consider a whitelist of allowed `Cache-Control` directives.

*   **2.1.3. Insecure Deserialization:**

    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Examine how `TTURLCache` stores and retrieves cached data.  Does it use a serialization format like `NSKeyedArchiver` (which is known to be vulnerable to insecure deserialization if the attacker can control the serialized data)?
    *   **Hypothetical Attack:** If the attacker can inject malicious data into the cache, and `TTURLCache` uses an insecure deserialization mechanism, the attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution when the poisoned data is loaded. This is a *very* high-impact vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Avoid using insecure deserialization methods like `NSKeyedArchiver` for cached data.  If serialization is necessary, use a secure alternative like `NSSecureCoding` and ensure that only trusted classes are allowed to be deserialized.  Consider using a simpler, safer format like JSON (with proper validation) if possible.

*   **2.1.4. Lack of Integrity Checks:**

    *   **Code Review Focus:**  Does `TTURLCache` perform any integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) on the cached data before using it?
    *   **Hypothetical Attack:**  Even if the attacker can't directly control the cache keys or headers, they might be able to modify the cached data on disk (if they have access to the device's file system, perhaps through another vulnerability). Without integrity checks, the application would unknowingly load and use the corrupted data.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Calculate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the cached data when it's stored and verify the hash when the data is retrieved.  If the hash doesn't match, discard the cached data and re-fetch it from the server.

*   **2.1.5.  Cache Size Limits and Eviction Policies:**

    *   **Code Review Focus:** Does `TTURLCache` have appropriate limits on the size of the cache?  What is the eviction policy (e.g., LRU, FIFO)?  Could an attacker flood the cache with malicious entries, evicting legitimate data and causing a denial-of-service?
    *   **Hypothetical Attack:** An attacker could send numerous requests with unique URLs, causing the cache to grow excessively large and potentially consume all available storage space.  They could also try to evict specific, frequently accessed entries by strategically filling the cache with their own data.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement reasonable limits on the total cache size and the size of individual cache entries.  Use a robust eviction policy (LRU is generally preferred) that is resistant to manipulation.

**2.2. Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful cache poisoning attack on `TTURLCache` can range from moderate to critical, depending on the type of data being cached and how the application uses it:

*   **Display of Incorrect/Malicious Content:**  If the cache is used to store UI elements or data displayed to the user, the attacker could inject misleading information, phishing links, or offensive content.
*   **Execution of Malicious Code:**  If the cached data is used to construct UI elements (e.g., HTML, JavaScript) or is deserialized in an insecure way, the attacker could achieve remote code execution (RCE). This is the most severe outcome.
*   **Data Corruption:**  If the cached data represents application state or configuration settings, the attacker could corrupt this data, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
*   **Denial of Service:**  By flooding the cache or evicting critical entries, the attacker could disrupt the application's functionality.

**2.3. Refined Mitigation Strategies:**

Based on the analysis above, we refine and expand the initial mitigation strategies:

1.  **Avoid Sensitive Data:**  *Never* cache sensitive data (user credentials, personal information, API keys, etc.) using `TTURLCache`. This is non-negotiable.

2.  **Cryptographic Keying:** Use a strong, cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the *entire* request (URL, relevant headers) as the cache key. This prevents key collision attacks.

3.  **Strict HTTP Header Handling:** Implement a robust parser for HTTP cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `ETag`, `Vary`) that strictly adheres to RFC 7234.  Whitelist allowed `Cache-Control` directives.

4.  **Secure Deserialization:**  *Absolutely avoid* `NSKeyedArchiver` for cached data. Use `NSSecureCoding` with a strict whitelist of allowed classes, or prefer a safer format like JSON with thorough validation.

5.  **Integrity Checks (Mandatory):**  Calculate and verify a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the cached data *before* using it. This is crucial to detect any tampering.

6.  **Cache Size and Eviction:** Implement reasonable limits on cache size and individual entry size. Use a robust eviction policy (LRU).

7.  **Input Validation:**  While this is a general best practice, it's particularly important here.  Validate *all* data received from the network *before* it's even considered for caching.

8.  **Modern Caching Solution (Strongly Recommended):**  Given the age and archived status of Three20, the *most secure* approach is to **replace `TTURLCache` with a modern, actively maintained caching library.**  Consider using `URLCache` (built into iOS) with proper configuration, or a third-party library like `SDWebImage` or `Kingfisher` (which are designed for image caching but can be adapted for other data types). These libraries have undergone more extensive security scrutiny and are more likely to be up-to-date with current best practices.

9.  **Regular Security Audits:** Even with a modern caching solution, regular security audits and penetration testing are essential to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendation

The `TTURLCache` component of the archived Three20 library presents a significant security risk due to potential cache poisoning vulnerabilities.  While the mitigations outlined above can reduce the risk, they are complex to implement correctly and may not be fully effective against all possible attack vectors.

**Therefore, the strongest recommendation is to replace `TTURLCache` with a modern, actively maintained caching solution.** This is the most reliable way to ensure the security of the application's caching mechanism. If replacement is absolutely not feasible, *all* of the refined mitigation strategies must be implemented meticulously, and the application should undergo rigorous security testing. The use of Three20 should be carefully reevaluated, as other components may also contain unpatched vulnerabilities.
