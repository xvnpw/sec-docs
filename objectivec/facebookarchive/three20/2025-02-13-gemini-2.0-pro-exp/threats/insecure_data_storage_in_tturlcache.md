# Deep Analysis: Insecure Data Storage in TTURLCache (Three20)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with insecure data storage within the `TTURLCache` component of the Three20 library.  We aim to:

*   Identify the specific mechanisms by which `TTURLCache` stores data.
*   Determine the default security posture of this storage.
*   Analyze the potential attack vectors an adversary could exploit.
*   Evaluate the real-world impact of a successful compromise.
*   Refine and expand upon the provided mitigation strategies.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers using (or considering using) Three20.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the `TTURLCache` component within the Three20 library.  We will consider:

*   **Code Analysis:** Examining the source code of `TTURLCache` (available on the provided GitHub repository, even though it's archived) to understand its storage implementation.
*   **iOS File System Security:**  Understanding the default file system permissions and security mechanisms on iOS, and how they relate to `TTURLCache`'s storage location.
*   **Attack Scenarios:**  Modeling realistic attack scenarios where an adversary could gain access to the cached data.
*   **Data Sensitivity:**  Categorizing the types of data that might be cached and their associated sensitivity levels.
*   **Mitigation Techniques:**  Evaluating the effectiveness and practicality of various mitigation strategies.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other components of Three20 (unless they directly interact with `TTURLCache` in a way that exacerbates the vulnerability).
*   General iOS security best practices (beyond those directly relevant to this specific threat).
*   Vulnerabilities in other caching libraries (although we may briefly mention alternatives).

## 3. Methodology

Our analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Source Code Review:**  We will examine the `TTURLCache.h` and `TTURLCache.m` files from the Three20 GitHub repository to understand:
    *   The file paths used for storing cached data.
    *   The methods used for writing and reading data (e.g., `NSData writeToFile:atomically:`, `[NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:]`).
    *   Any existing encryption or access control mechanisms (or lack thereof).
    *   Cache invalidation and deletion logic.

2.  **iOS File System Analysis:** We will research and document the default file system permissions and security features of iOS relevant to application data storage, including:
    *   Application sandbox restrictions.
    *   Data protection classes (e.g., `NSFileProtectionComplete`, `NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen`).
    *   The impact of device jailbreaking on file system security.

3.  **Attack Vector Identification:** We will brainstorm and document potential attack vectors, considering:
    *   **Jailbroken Devices:**  The most likely scenario, where an attacker has elevated privileges.
    *   **Application Vulnerabilities:**  Other vulnerabilities in the application (e.g., path traversal) that could be leveraged to access the cache.
    *   **Backup Exploitation:**  Extracting cached data from device backups (if backups are not properly encrypted).
    *   **Physical Access:**  An attacker with physical access to an unlocked device.

4.  **Impact Assessment:** We will analyze the potential impact of data exposure, considering different types of sensitive data:
    *   Usernames and passwords.
    *   Session tokens.
    *   API keys.
    *   Personal information (names, addresses, etc.).
    *   Financial data.
    *   Proprietary application data.

5.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:** We will critically evaluate the provided mitigation strategies and propose additional or refined approaches.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Source Code Review (TTURLCache)

Based on a review of the Three20 source code (specifically `TTURLCache`), the following observations are made:

*   **Storage Location:** `TTURLCache` stores cached data in the application's `Caches` directory.  The specific path is constructed using `NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSCachesDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES)`.  This directory is *not* automatically encrypted by default on iOS.
*   **File Writing:**  The code uses `[data writeToFile:path atomically:YES]` to write data to the cache.  The `atomically:YES` flag provides some protection against data corruption, but *no* security against unauthorized access.
*   **No Encryption:**  There is *no* built-in encryption mechanism within `TTURLCache`.  Data is stored in plain text (or whatever format the original data was in).
*   **Cache Keying:**  Cache keys are typically based on URLs.  This means that an attacker who can guess or obtain URLs used by the application can potentially predict the corresponding cache file names.
*   **Cache Invalidation:**  `TTURLCache` has methods for invalidating and deleting cached items, but these rely on the application developer to implement them correctly.  If the application doesn't properly manage the cache, sensitive data can persist indefinitely.
* **Image Caching:** There is dedicated method for image caching.

### 4.2 iOS File System Security

*   **Application Sandbox:** iOS applications operate within a sandbox, which restricts their access to other applications' data and system resources.  However, the `Caches` directory is *within* the application's sandbox, so any process running within the application (including potentially malicious code injected through another vulnerability) has access to it.
*   **Data Protection:** iOS offers Data Protection classes, which provide encryption for files.  However, the `Caches` directory is *not* encrypted by default.  The application developer must explicitly enable Data Protection for files within the `Caches` directory.  `TTURLCache` does *not* do this.
*   **Jailbreaking:**  A jailbroken device bypasses many of iOS's security restrictions, including the application sandbox.  On a jailbroken device, an attacker can easily access the `Caches` directory of any application.
*   **Backups:**  The `Caches` directory is *not* included in iCloud backups by default.  However, it *may* be included in unencrypted iTunes backups.

### 4.3 Attack Vectors

1.  **Jailbroken Device (Primary Threat):**  On a jailbroken device, an attacker with file system access can directly browse to the application's `Caches` directory and read the contents of any files stored there by `TTURLCache`.  This is the most straightforward and likely attack vector.

2.  **Application Vulnerability Exploitation:**  If the application has another vulnerability (e.g., a path traversal vulnerability that allows reading arbitrary files within the sandbox), an attacker could exploit that vulnerability to read the contents of the `TTURLCache` files.

3.  **Unencrypted Backup Extraction:**  If the user creates an unencrypted iTunes backup of their device, an attacker with access to that backup can extract the contents of the `Caches` directory.

4.  **Physical Access (Unlocked Device):**  An attacker with physical access to an unlocked device could potentially use a file manager application (if installed) or connect the device to a computer to access the `Caches` directory.  This is less likely than the other attack vectors, but still possible.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful compromise depends on the type of data stored in the cache.  Examples include:

*   **Session Tokens:**  An attacker could steal a user's session token and impersonate them, gaining access to their account and data.
*   **API Keys:**  Exposure of API keys could allow an attacker to make unauthorized API calls, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or financial loss.
*   **Personal Information:**  Exposure of personal information could lead to identity theft, fraud, or other privacy violations.
*   **Cached Images:** Even seemingly innocuous data like cached images could reveal sensitive information, depending on the application's context (e.g., medical images, private photos).

### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

The original mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but we can expand and refine them:

1.  **Avoid Caching Sensitive Data (Strongly Recommended):**  The best mitigation is to *never* store sensitive data in `TTURLCache` (or any unencrypted cache).  This is the most secure approach.

2.  **Use iOS Keychain (for Credentials and Small Secrets):**  For storing usernames, passwords, and small secrets (like API keys), the iOS Keychain is the recommended solution.  It provides hardware-backed encryption and access controls.

3.  **Use `NSFileProtectionComplete` (or Better):**  If you *must* cache data that is not highly sensitive but still requires some protection, use Data Protection with at least the `NSFileProtectionComplete` attribute.  This encrypts the file when the device is locked.  `NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication` or `NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen` may be even better choices, depending on your needs.  This requires modifying the file writing logic in `TTURLCache` (or using a different caching solution).

4.  **Implement Custom Encryption:**  If you need to cache sensitive data and cannot use the Keychain or Data Protection directly, implement your own encryption layer *before* writing data to `TTURLCache`.  Use a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256) with a securely managed key.  This key should *not* be stored in the cache itself.

5.  **Short Cache Expiration:**  Minimize the lifetime of cached data.  Implement aggressive cache invalidation and deletion policies to reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker.

6.  **Regular Cache Clearing:**  Provide a mechanism for users to clear the cache manually (e.g., a "Clear Cache" button in the application settings).

7.  **Consider Alternatives:**  Explore alternative caching libraries that provide built-in security features, such as:
    *   **PINCache:**  A popular, modern caching library for iOS.
    *   **HanekeSwift:**  Another well-regarded caching library.
    *   **SDWebImage:** Primarily for image caching, but offers more control over caching behavior than `TTURLCache`.

8. **Educate Developers:** Ensure that all developers working with Three20 are aware of the security risks associated with `TTURLCache` and the recommended mitigation strategies.

## 5. Conclusion

The `TTURLCache` component of Three20 presents a significant security risk due to its lack of built-in encryption and reliance on the default (unencrypted) `Caches` directory on iOS.  The primary threat is from attackers on jailbroken devices, but other attack vectors exist.  The impact can range from session hijacking to exposure of sensitive personal or financial data.  The most effective mitigation is to avoid caching sensitive data altogether.  If caching is necessary, strong encryption and careful cache management are essential.  Developers should strongly consider using alternative caching libraries with better security features or implementing robust security measures themselves.  The use of Three20, especially `TTURLCache`, should be carefully evaluated and, in most cases, avoided in favor of more secure alternatives.
