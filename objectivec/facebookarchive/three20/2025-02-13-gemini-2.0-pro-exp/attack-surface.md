# Attack Surface Analysis for facebookarchive/three20

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Three20 Code](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_three20_code.md)

*   **Description:** The Three20 codebase is unmaintained; vulnerabilities discovered after its archival are unpatched.
*   **Three20 Contribution:** The library's code *is* the attack surface. Flaws within its components are directly exploitable.
*   **Example:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability in `TTURLRequest`'s handling of redirects could allow an open redirect attack, sending users to a phishing site.  Or, a flaw in `TTImageView`'s image processing could lead to a buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Varies widely (XSS, Open Redirects, DoS, potentially RCE in worst-case scenarios).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Audit (Essential):** A thorough security audit of the application's *use of Three20* is crucial. Focus on how Three20 components are used and interact with user input.
    *   **Input Validation and Output Encoding (Essential):** Rigorously validate all input and encode output, *especially* where Three20 components display data. This is the primary defense against XSS.
    *   **Migration (Essential):** Migrating away from Three20 is the *only* definitive solution.
    *   **WAF:** Use Web Application Firewall.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Dependencies (Directly Bundled)](./attack_surfaces/outdated_dependencies__directly_bundled_.md)

*   **Description:** Three20 *may* directly bundle outdated, vulnerable libraries within its own codebase.
*   **Three20 Contribution:** If Three20 includes outdated libraries *within its own source*, these vulnerabilities are directly introduced, regardless of system-level libraries.
*   **Example:** If Three20 bundles an old version of a networking library *inside* its own code (rather than relying on a system-installed version), that bundled library's vulnerabilities are directly present.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Analysis (Focused):** Examine Three20's source code to identify any *bundled* dependencies.  Attempt to update these *within the Three20 codebase* (extremely difficult and likely to break functionality).
    *   **Forking and Patching (Extremely High Effort):** Fork Three20 and manually patch any bundled, vulnerable dependencies. This is a *very* high-effort, unsustainable approach.
    *   **Migration (Essential):** Migration is the only practical long-term solution.
    * **Isolate the application:** If possible, run the application in sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UI Components (Direct Handling)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_ui_components__direct_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Three20's UI components (e.g., `TTTableView`, `TTTableViewController`) might not properly sanitize user-generated content *within their own rendering logic*.
*   **Three20 Contribution:** These components are directly responsible for rendering, and if *their internal code* doesn't handle untrusted input securely, they are the XSS injection point.
*   **Example:** If `TTTableView`'s internal rendering code directly inserts user-provided text into the DOM without escaping, an attacker can inject `<script>` tags.
*   **Impact:** Session Hijacking, Defacement, Phishing, Data Theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Audit (Focused):** Audit the *Three20 source code* for these components, specifically looking at how they handle and render data. Identify any areas where user input is directly inserted into the UI without proper escaping.
    *   **Output Encoding (Within Three20 - Very Difficult):** Ideally, you would modify Three20's code to perform proper output encoding. This is *extremely* difficult and risky, as it requires deep understanding of the library and could introduce instability.
    *   **Migration (Essential):** The practical solution is to migrate to a framework with built-in XSS protection.
    *   **WAF:** Use Web Application Firewall.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - `TTURLRequest`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__-__tturlrequest_.md)

*   **Description:** If user input is used *directly* to construct URLs for `TTURLRequest` without proper validation *within the application's use of Three20*, the application is vulnerable to SSRF.
*   **Three20 Contribution:** `TTURLRequest` is the component *making* the network requests. The vulnerability arises from how the *application* uses this component.
*   **Example:** If the application takes a user-provided URL and *directly* passes it to `TTURLRequest` without any validation, an attacker can access internal resources.
*   **Impact:** Access to Internal Systems, Data Leakage, Cloud Resource Compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Essential):** *Within the application code that uses `TTURLRequest`*, strictly validate all user-supplied URLs. Use a whitelist of allowed domains and URL schemes.  Do *not* pass user-provided URLs directly to `TTURLRequest` without thorough sanitization.
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled URLs:** If possible, avoid using user-supplied URLs directly. Use internal identifiers or proxies instead.
    *   **Code Review:** Review all code that uses `TTURLRequest` to ensure proper input validation.
