# Deep Analysis: Exploiting `NSCoding` in Three20 (Attack Tree Path 3.1.1)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to determine the *actual* risk and exploitability of the identified attack path (Exploiting `NSCoding` or other serialization mechanisms) within a hypothetical application that utilizes the Three20 library.  We aim to move beyond the theoretical and assess:

*   **Concrete Vulnerability Existence:**  Does Three20, in its common usage patterns, *actually* deserialize data from untrusted sources using `NSCoding` or similar mechanisms?  We need to identify specific classes and methods.
*   **Exploitation Feasibility:** If a vulnerability exists, how difficult would it be to craft a working exploit?  This includes identifying potential "gadget chains" within Three20 itself or common iOS/macOS frameworks.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  If a vulnerability is confirmed, what are the most effective and practical mitigation strategies, considering the library is archived and no longer maintained?
*   **Impact on Application:** How would a successful exploit of this vulnerability in Three20 affect the *overall* application using it?  This goes beyond just RCE within Three20's context.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is specifically focused on:

*   **Three20 Library:**  The core Three20 library itself, as found on the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/facebookarchive/three20).  We will not analyze custom application code *unless* it directly interacts with Three20's serialization mechanisms.
*   **`NSCoding` and Related Mechanisms:**  Primarily `NSCoding`, `NSSecureCoding`, and potentially other serialization methods like `NSKeyedArchiver`/`NSKeyedUnarchiver`.  We'll also consider custom serialization if it exhibits similar vulnerabilities.
*   **Untrusted Data Sources:**  We will define "untrusted" as any data originating from:
    *   Network requests (HTTP responses, etc.)
    *   User input (text fields, file uploads, etc.)
    *   Inter-process communication (IPC)
    *   External storage (files, databases) that could be modified by other applications or the user.
    *   URL Schemes (if Three20 handles data passed via custom URL schemes).
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The ultimate goal of the attacker is assumed to be RCE.  We will consider other potential impacts (e.g., data leakage, denial of service) as secondary concerns.
* **Archived Status:** We acknowledge Three20 is archived.  This impacts mitigation strategies, as patching the library directly is not a viable long-term solution.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   **Manual Inspection:**  We will manually examine the Three20 source code, focusing on classes that implement the `NSCoding` protocol (or use `NSKeyedArchiver`/`NSKeyedUnarchiver`).  We will use `grep`, code search within an IDE, and manual browsing of the repository.  Key search terms: `implements NSCoding`, `NSKeyedUnarchiver`, `unarchiveObjectWithData`, `unarchiveObjectWithFile`, `initWithCoder`, `encodeWithCoder`.
    *   **Identify Data Flow:**  For each identified class, we will trace how data flows into and out of the serialization/deserialization process.  The goal is to determine if any untrusted data sources can reach the deserialization methods.  This is the most critical and time-consuming step.
    *   **Gadget Chain Analysis (Preliminary):**  If a potential vulnerability is found, we will perform a preliminary analysis of potential gadget chains within Three20 and common iOS frameworks.  This will involve identifying classes that implement `NSCoding` and have methods that could be abused during deserialization.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Limited):**
    *   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development (If Necessary):**  If a strong candidate vulnerability is identified through static analysis, we will attempt to develop a *limited* PoC.  The goal is *not* to create a fully weaponized exploit, but rather to demonstrate that deserialization of attacker-controlled data is possible.  This might involve creating a simple iOS application that uses Three20 and feeds it crafted data.  We will prioritize *demonstrating the vulnerability* over achieving full RCE.
    *   **Debugging:**  We will use Xcode's debugger to step through the deserialization process and observe the behavior of the application.  This will help confirm the data flow and identify any unexpected behavior.
    * **Instrumentation (Frida, Objection - Optional):** If static analysis reveals potential vulnerabilities, but dynamic confirmation is difficult, we might use tools like Frida or Objection to hook into relevant methods (`unarchiveObjectWithData`, etc.) and inspect the data being deserialized. This is a more advanced technique.

3.  **Documentation Review:**
    *   **Three20 Documentation:**  We will review any available Three20 documentation (including comments in the code) for information about intended usage and security considerations related to serialization.
    *   **Apple's Documentation:**  We will consult Apple's documentation on `NSCoding`, `NSSecureCoding`, and related topics to understand the security best practices and potential pitfalls.

4.  **Vulnerability Reporting (Hypothetical):**
    Since Three20 is archived, a formal vulnerability report is not applicable.  However, we will document our findings as if we were preparing a report, including:
    *   Vulnerable code locations (file and line number)
    *   Description of the vulnerability
    *   Steps to reproduce (if a PoC is developed)
    *   Impact assessment
    *   Mitigation recommendations

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path (3.1.1)

**4.1. Initial Code Review and Target Identification**

Using `grep` and code search within an IDE, we search for implementations of `NSCoding` and usage of `NSKeyedUnarchiver`.

```bash
grep -r "implements NSCoding" .
grep -r "NSKeyedUnarchiver" .
grep -r "unarchiveObjectWithData" .
grep -r "unarchiveObjectWithFile" .
```

This search reveals several potential areas of interest within Three20:

*   **`TTURLCache`:** This class appears to be a central component for caching data fetched from URLs.  It extensively uses `NSCoding` to serialize and deserialize cached responses, including headers and data.  This is a *high-priority target* because it directly handles network data, a primary source of untrusted input.
*   **`TTModelViewController` and related classes:** These classes, related to data models and view controllers, also implement `NSCoding`.  It's less clear immediately whether they handle untrusted data, but they warrant further investigation.
*   **`TTStyledText` and related classes:**  These classes, used for rendering styled text, also use `NSCoding`.  If an application allows users to input styled text that is then processed by Three20, this could be a potential attack vector.
*   **Various other smaller classes:** Several other classes implement `NSCoding`, but their role in handling untrusted data is less obvious from a quick scan.

**4.2. Deep Dive into `TTURLCache`**

`TTURLCache` is the most concerning component due to its direct interaction with network data.  We need to analyze how it uses `NSCoding`.

*   **`storeResponse:forRequest:`:** This method is responsible for storing a network response in the cache.  It uses `NSKeyedArchiver` to serialize the response data, including the `NSURLResponse` object, the response data (`NSData`), and potentially other metadata.
*   **`restoreResponseForRequest:`:** This method retrieves a cached response.  It uses `NSKeyedUnarchiver` to deserialize the data.
*   **`cachePathForRequest:`:** This method determines the file path where the cached data is stored.

The key vulnerability lies in the fact that `TTURLCache`, in its default configuration, does *not* use `NSSecureCoding`.  It uses the older, less secure `NSCoding` protocol.  This means that an attacker who can control the contents of a cached response (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack, a compromised server, or by poisoning the cache) can inject a malicious serialized object.  When `restoreResponseForRequest:` is called, this malicious object will be deserialized, potentially leading to RCE.

**4.3. Exploitation Feasibility (Gadget Chains)**

Exploiting this vulnerability requires finding a "gadget chain."  A gadget chain is a sequence of Objective-C objects and method calls that, when deserialized, will ultimately execute arbitrary code.  This is often a complex process, but the widespread use of `NSCoding` in iOS and macOS frameworks provides many potential gadgets.

*   **Common Gadgets:**  Research on `NSCoding` vulnerabilities has identified several common gadget chains, often involving classes like `NSInvocation`, `NSException`, and various UI-related classes.  These gadgets might be present in the application's dependencies, even if not directly in Three20.
*   **Three20 Gadgets:**  We would need to analyze the classes within Three20 that implement `NSCoding` to see if any of them contain methods that could be abused as part of a gadget chain.  This is a time-consuming process.
*   **iOS Framework Gadgets:**  The iOS SDK itself contains numerous classes that implement `NSCoding`.  An attacker could potentially leverage these classes to build a gadget chain.

**4.4. Proof-of-Concept (Hypothetical Scenario)**

A simplified PoC scenario could involve the following:

1.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**  The attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and a server.
2.  **Response Modification:**  The attacker modifies a legitimate HTTP response that the application is expected to cache using Three20's `TTURLCache`.  The attacker replaces the legitimate response body with a malicious serialized object.
3.  **Cache Poisoning:**  The modified response is stored in the Three20 cache.
4.  **Trigger Deserialization:**  The next time the application requests the same URL, `TTURLCache` retrieves the poisoned response from the cache and attempts to deserialize it using `NSKeyedUnarchiver`.
5.  **Code Execution:**  The malicious serialized object is deserialized, triggering the gadget chain and executing arbitrary code.

**4.5. Impact on Application**

A successful exploit of this vulnerability would grant the attacker Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the context of the application.  This means the attacker could:

*   **Steal Sensitive Data:**  Access user data, credentials, tokens, etc., stored within the application.
*   **Modify Application Behavior:**  Change the application's functionality, display fake information, or redirect the user to malicious websites.
*   **Install Malware:**  Potentially install additional malware on the device.
*   **Access Device Resources:**  Depending on the application's permissions, the attacker might be able to access the camera, microphone, contacts, location data, etc.

**4.6. Mitigation Strategies**

Since Three20 is archived, direct patching is not a viable long-term solution.  Here are the recommended mitigation strategies:

1.  **Replace Three20:**  The *most effective* mitigation is to replace Three20 with a modern, actively maintained alternative.  This is likely to be a significant undertaking, but it's the only way to ensure long-term security.  Modern networking libraries and UI frameworks should be used instead.
2.  **Disable `TTURLCache` (If Possible):**  If replacing Three20 is not immediately feasible, and the application does *not* rely on `TTURLCache`'s functionality, disable it entirely.  This eliminates the primary attack vector.
3.  **Implement `NSSecureCoding` (Partial Mitigation):**  While not a complete solution, modifying Three20 to use `NSSecureCoding` instead of `NSCoding` can significantly increase the difficulty of exploitation.  `NSSecureCoding` requires specifying the expected classes during deserialization, which limits the attacker's ability to inject arbitrary objects.  However, this requires:
    *   Modifying the Three20 source code (forking it).
    *   Carefully identifying *all* classes that are expected to be deserialized and adding them to the allowed classes list.  Missing a class can lead to application crashes or still leave vulnerabilities.
    *   Understanding that `NSSecureCoding` is not a silver bullet; vulnerabilities can still exist if allowed classes have exploitable methods.
4.  **Network Security Measures:**
    *   **HTTPS with Certificate Pinning:**  Use HTTPS for all network communication and implement certificate pinning to prevent MitM attacks.  This makes it much harder for an attacker to inject malicious responses.
    *   **Input Validation:**  If the application receives any data from the network that is used to construct URLs or interact with Three20, rigorously validate this data to prevent injection attacks.
5.  **Code Auditing and Security Testing:**  Regularly audit the application's code and conduct penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including those related to serialization.
6.  **Runtime Protection (RASP):** Consider using a Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) solution. RASP tools can monitor the application's behavior at runtime and detect or prevent exploitation attempts, including those targeting deserialization vulnerabilities. This is a more advanced mitigation.

## 5. Conclusion

The analysis confirms that Three20's `TTURLCache` component, due to its use of `NSCoding` without `NSSecureCoding` and its handling of network data, presents a *critical* vulnerability to deserialization attacks.  This vulnerability can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if an attacker can control the data being cached.  The archived status of Three20 makes this vulnerability particularly concerning, as no official patches will be released.  The primary recommendation is to replace Three20 with a modern alternative.  If that's not immediately possible, a combination of the other mitigation strategies should be implemented to reduce the risk.  The most important immediate steps are to disable `TTURLCache` if it's not essential, and to implement HTTPS with certificate pinning to prevent MitM attacks.  Further investigation into other Three20 components that use `NSCoding` is also warranted.
