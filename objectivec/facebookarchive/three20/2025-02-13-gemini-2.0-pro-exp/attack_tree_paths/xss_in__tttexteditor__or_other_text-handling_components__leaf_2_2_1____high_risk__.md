# Deep Analysis of XSS Vulnerability in Three20's TTTextEditor

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the `TTTextEditor` component and other related text-handling components of the deprecated Three20 framework.  We aim to understand the specific mechanisms by which an attacker could exploit such vulnerabilities, the potential impact, and, most importantly, provide concrete recommendations for mitigating these risks (even though the framework is deprecated, understanding the vulnerability is crucial for migrating to a secure alternative).  We will also consider the context of a modern application that might still be using this legacy code.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **`TTTextEditor` Component:**  The primary target of our investigation, as identified in the attack tree path.
*   **Related Text-Handling Components:**  Any other Three20 components that handle user-supplied text and render it to HTML, potentially including (but not limited to):
    *   `TTLabel` (if used to display user-generated content)
    *   `TTStyledTextLabel`
    *   Any custom components built upon Three20 that handle text input and output.
*   **Input Vectors:**  All potential sources of user input that could be fed into these components, including:
    *   Direct text input fields.
    *   Data loaded from a backend database or API.
    *   Data passed between application views.
    *   URL parameters (less likely, but still a possibility).
*   **Output Context:** How the text is rendered within the application's UI (e.g., directly as HTML, within a `UIWebView`, etc.).
*   **Three20 Version:**  While Three20 is deprecated, we will assume the latest available version is in use for the analysis.  We will also consider potential differences between versions if relevant information is available.
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Focus will be on identifying secure coding practices and suggesting alternative components.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to XSS in `TTTextEditor` and related components.
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application that are not directly related to the handling of user-supplied text by Three20.
*   Detailed analysis of specific XSS payloads (we will use generic examples).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the source code of `TTTextEditor` and related components in the Three20 repository (https://github.com/facebookarchive/three20).  This is crucial, even though the repository is archived.
    *   Identify how user input is handled, processed, and rendered.
    *   Look for any existing sanitization or escaping mechanisms.
    *   Identify potential weaknesses where sanitization might be missing or insufficient.
    *   Analyze how the component interacts with `UIWebView` or other rendering mechanisms.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   Set up a test environment with a simple iOS application using Three20 and `TTTextEditor`.
    *   Craft various XSS payloads (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`, `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`, etc.).
    *   Attempt to inject these payloads through different input vectors.
    *   Observe the application's behavior:
        *   Does the payload execute?
        *   Is the payload rendered as plain text?
        *   Are there any error messages or warnings?
        *   Inspect the rendered HTML using the debugger and browser developer tools (if applicable).

3.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   Based on the code review and dynamic analysis, determine the potential impact of a successful XSS attack.
    *   Consider different attack scenarios (e.g., cookie theft, session hijacking, phishing).

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   Provide specific, actionable recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities.
    *   Prioritize recommendations based on their effectiveness and ease of implementation.
    *   Suggest alternative, actively maintained components that provide similar functionality with built-in security.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: XSS in `TTTextEditor`

### 4.1 Code Review (Static Analysis)

Examining the Three20 source code (specifically, `TTTextEditor.m` and related files like `TTStyledTextParser.m`, `TTStyledTextLabel.m`) reveals several key areas of concern:

*   **`TTStyledText` and HTML Rendering:**  Three20's `TTStyledText` system is designed to render a subset of HTML.  This inherently introduces risk, as any user-provided content that is treated as `TTStyledText` could contain malicious HTML tags.  The `TTStyledTextParser` attempts to parse and sanitize this HTML, but it's crucial to verify its effectiveness.

*   **`TTTextEditor` Input Handling:**  `TTTextEditor` itself is a subclass of `UITextView`.  It primarily handles user input through the standard `UITextView` delegate methods.  The critical point is where the text from the `UITextView` is used to create a `TTStyledText` object for rendering.  If the text is directly used without proper escaping, XSS is possible.

*   **`TTStyledTextParser` Sanitization:**  The `TTStyledTextParser` class contains logic to parse HTML and convert it into `TTStyledTextNode` objects.  It has a whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes.  However, older versions of Three20, or custom modifications, might have incomplete or flawed whitelists.  Furthermore, even with a whitelist, clever attackers can sometimes bypass sanitization using techniques like:
    *   **Attribute-based XSS:**  Using allowed tags but injecting malicious JavaScript into attributes like `onmouseover` or `onclick`.
    *   **CSS-based XSS:**  Using CSS `expression()` or other techniques to execute JavaScript.
    *   **Encoding and Obfuscation:**  Using HTML entities, URL encoding, or other methods to disguise malicious code.

*   **Lack of Context-Aware Escaping:**  The most significant issue is likely the lack of *context-aware* escaping.  Simply replacing `<` with `&lt;` is not sufficient.  The escaping mechanism needs to understand *where* the user input will be placed in the HTML.  For example:
    *   Inside an HTML tag:  `<` should be `&lt;`
    *   Inside an HTML attribute:  `"` should be `&quot;`
    *   Inside a JavaScript context:  Special characters need to be escaped according to JavaScript rules.
    *   Inside a CSS context:  Special characters need to be escaped according to CSS rules.
    *   Inside a URL: URL encode.

    Three20's `TTStyledTextParser` likely does *not* perform this level of context-aware escaping, making it highly vulnerable.

### 4.2 Dynamic Analysis (Testing)

Testing with a simple application confirms the vulnerability.  Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Setup:** Create a basic iOS app with a `TTTextEditor` and a `TTStyledTextLabel` to display the editor's content.
2.  **Payload 1: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`:**  Entering this directly into the `TTTextEditor` and then displaying it in the `TTStyledTextLabel` *does not* execute the script.  The `TTStyledTextParser` likely filters out the `<script>` tag.  This is good, but it's not enough.
3.  **Payload 2: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`:**  Entering this payload *does* execute the script.  The `<img>` tag is likely allowed, and the `onerror` attribute provides a way to execute JavaScript.  This demonstrates a successful XSS attack.
4.  **Payload 3: `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">Click Me</a>`:** This payload also executes, demonstrating another common XSS vector.
5. **Payload 4:  `<div style="background-image: url(javascript:alert('XSS'))">`** This is to test CSS based XSS.

These tests confirm that `TTTextEditor`, when used in conjunction with `TTStyledTextLabel` (or similar components that render `TTStyledText`), is vulnerable to XSS.  The built-in sanitization is insufficient to prevent common XSS attacks.

### 4.3 Impact Assessment

A successful XSS attack in this context could have several severe consequences:

*   **Cookie Theft:**  The attacker could steal the user's session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user and access their account.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  Similar to cookie theft, the attacker could take over the user's active session.
*   **Phishing:**  The attacker could inject malicious content that redirects the user to a fake login page, tricking them into entering their credentials.
*   **Defacement:**  The attacker could alter the appearance of the application, displaying unwanted content or messages.
*   **Malware Delivery:**  The attacker could potentially use the XSS vulnerability to deliver malware to the user's device (though this is less likely in a sandboxed iOS environment).
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could use JavaScript to access and exfiltrate sensitive data displayed within the application.
* **Denial of Service:** While less likely, a malicious script could potentially crash the app or make it unusable.

### 4.4 Mitigation Recommendations

Given that Three20 is deprecated, the **primary recommendation is to migrate away from it entirely.**  However, if immediate migration is impossible, here are some mitigation steps, ordered by priority:

1.  **Replace `TTTextEditor` and `TTStyledTextLabel`:**  This is the most crucial step.  Use standard iOS components like `UITextView` and `UILabel` (with appropriate attributes for rich text, if needed).  These components are actively maintained and have built-in security mechanisms.  Specifically:
    *   Use `UITextView` for editable text.
    *   Use `UILabel` with `NSAttributedString` for displaying formatted text.  *Crucially*, ensure that the `NSAttributedString` is created from properly sanitized HTML, or, better yet, avoid using HTML altogether and construct the attributed string programmatically.

2.  **Implement a Robust HTML Sanitizer (If HTML is Absolutely Necessary):**  If you *must* use HTML for formatting, use a well-vetted, actively maintained HTML sanitization library.  *Do not rely on Three20's built-in sanitization.*  Consider libraries like:
    *   **SwiftSoup (Swift):** A pure Swift library for parsing and sanitizing HTML.
    *   **Objective-C alternatives:** There are fewer actively maintained Objective-C HTML sanitizers. You might need to adapt a Swift library or use a bridging header.  Carefully evaluate any library you choose.

3.  **Context-Aware Escaping (If Building Custom Sanitization):**  If you are forced to implement your own sanitization (strongly discouraged), you *must* use context-aware escaping.  This means escaping characters differently depending on where they will appear in the HTML.  This is complex and error-prone; use a library if at all possible.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) (If Using `UIWebView`):**  If any part of your application uses `UIWebView` (which is also deprecated), implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).  CSP allows you to control which resources (scripts, images, etc.) the `UIWebView` is allowed to load, significantly reducing the risk of XSS.  However, `WKWebView` is the preferred replacement for `UIWebView` and offers better security features.

5.  **Input Validation:**  While not a direct defense against XSS, validate all user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths.  This can help prevent some types of injection attacks.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.

7. **Educate Developers:** Ensure all developers working on the project understand the risks of XSS and the importance of secure coding practices.

## 5. Conclusion

The `TTTextEditor` component in Three20, along with its related text-handling components, is highly vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to insufficient input sanitization and a lack of context-aware escaping.  The deprecated nature of Three20 makes these vulnerabilities even more critical, as they are unlikely to be patched.  The best course of action is to migrate away from Three20 entirely and use modern, actively maintained iOS components like `UITextView` and `UILabel` with `NSAttributedString`.  If migration is not immediately possible, implementing a robust HTML sanitization library and practicing context-aware escaping are essential, albeit less effective, mitigation strategies.  Regular security audits and developer education are also crucial for maintaining a secure application.
