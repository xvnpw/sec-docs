Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Parameter Injection into View Controllers" attack tree path, focusing on the context of the (now archived) Three20 library.

## Deep Analysis: Parameter Injection into View Controllers (Three20)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with parameter injection vulnerabilities within applications utilizing the Three20 library's `TTNavigator` component.  We aim to identify:

*   Specific code patterns within Three20 and application code that are susceptible to parameter injection.
*   The potential consequences of successful exploitation, considering various injection types (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection, DoS).
*   Practical mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent or minimize the risk of parameter injection.
*   How to detect this vulnerability during code reviews and security testing.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the `TTNavigator` component of the Three20 library and its interaction with view controllers.  We will consider:

*   How `TTNavigator` handles URL mapping and parameter passing.
*   Common patterns of view controller initialization and data handling that might be vulnerable.
*   The interaction between `TTNavigator` and other Three20 components (e.g., `TTURLRequest`, `TTModelViewController`) that might influence the vulnerability.
*   The impact of using Three20 in conjunction with other libraries or frameworks.  While we won't deeply analyze *every* possible combination, we'll acknowledge potential interactions.
*   We will *not* cover vulnerabilities unrelated to `TTNavigator`'s parameter handling (e.g., general iOS security best practices outside the scope of Three20).

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the source code of `TTNavigator` and related Three20 components to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This includes looking for:
    *   How URLs are parsed and parameters extracted.
    *   How parameters are passed to view controllers (e.g., via `init` methods, properties, or custom methods).
    *   Any existing sanitization or validation mechanisms (or lack thereof).
    *   Use of potentially dangerous functions (e.g., `stringWithFormat:` without proper escaping, direct use of parameters in SQL queries or system commands).

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical):**  While we won't be running live tests on a production system, we will *hypothetically* construct scenarios and payloads to illustrate how an attacker might exploit identified vulnerabilities.  This will involve:
    *   Crafting malicious URLs with injected parameters.
    *   Tracing the flow of these parameters through the application.
    *   Predicting the outcome based on the code review findings.

3.  **Literature Review:** We will consult existing security advisories, blog posts, and documentation related to Three20 and similar navigation frameworks to identify known vulnerabilities and best practices.

4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attacker profiles and their motivations to understand the likelihood and impact of different attack scenarios.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Parameter Injection into View Controllers

**2.1.  Understanding `TTNavigator` and Parameter Passing**

The core of the vulnerability lies in how `TTNavigator` maps URLs to view controllers and passes parameters.  `TTNavigator` uses a URL-based navigation system.  A typical Three20 URL might look like this:

```
tt://myViewController/edit?userID=123&itemName=MyItem
```

*   `tt://`:  The custom URL scheme.
*   `myViewController/edit`:  The path, which `TTNavigator` maps to a specific view controller class (e.g., `MyViewController`).  The `edit` part might indicate a specific action or mode.
*   `?userID=123&itemName=MyItem`:  The query parameters.  These are the key to the injection vulnerability.

`TTNavigator` parses this URL and performs the following (simplified) steps:

1.  **URL Scheme Check:** Verifies that the URL starts with a registered scheme (e.g., `tt://`).
2.  **Path Mapping:**  Uses a mapping table (defined by the application) to find the view controller class associated with the path (`myViewController/edit`).
3.  **Parameter Extraction:**  Parses the query string (`?userID=123&itemName=MyItem`) into a dictionary of key-value pairs.
4.  **View Controller Instantiation:** Creates an instance of the mapped view controller class.
5.  **Parameter Passing:**  This is the *critical* step.  `TTNavigator` needs to somehow pass the extracted parameters to the newly created view controller.  There are several ways this *could* happen (and each has different security implications):

    *   **Direct Property Setting:**  `TTNavigator` might directly set properties on the view controller instance using Key-Value Coding (KVC).  For example:
        ```objectivec
        [viewController setValue:[params objectForKey:@"userID"] forKey:@"userID"];
        ```
        This is *highly dangerous* if the view controller doesn't properly validate or sanitize the `userID` property.

    *   **Custom Initialization Methods:**  The application might define custom `init` methods that accept parameters.  For example:
        ```objectivec
        // In MyViewController.h
        - (id)initWithUserID:(NSString *)userID itemName:(NSString *)itemName;

        // In TTNavigator (hypothetical)
        MyViewController *vc = [[MyViewController alloc] initWithUserID:params[@"userID"] itemName:params[@"itemName"]];
        ```
        The vulnerability here depends on how `initWithUserID:itemName:` handles the parameters.

    *   **URL Action Methods:** Three20 has the concept of "URL actions," which are methods that can be invoked based on the URL.  These methods might receive the parameters as arguments.
        ```objectivec
        // In MyViewController.h
        - (void)editWithParameters:(NSDictionary *)parameters;

        // In TTNavigator (hypothetical)
        [viewController editWithParameters:params];
        ```
        Again, the vulnerability depends on how `editWithParameters:` handles the input.

    *   **Passing the Entire Parameter Dictionary:** `TTNavigator` might pass the entire `NSDictionary` of parameters to the view controller through a designated method or property. This shifts the responsibility of extracting and validating parameters entirely to the view controller.

**2.2.  Specific Injection Scenarios (Hypothetical)**

Let's consider some hypothetical scenarios based on the above parameter passing mechanisms:

**Scenario 1: SQL Injection via Direct Property Setting**

*   **Vulnerable Code (MyViewController.m):**
    ```objectivec
    @interface MyViewController : UIViewController
    @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *userID;
    @end

    @implementation MyViewController
    - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        // Directly using the userID property in a SQL query (BAD!)
        NSString *query = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '%@'", self.userID];
        // ... execute the query ...
    }
    @end
    ```
*   **Attacker URL:**
    ```
    tt://myViewController/edit?userID=1';DROP TABLE users;--
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The attacker injects a malicious SQL statement into the `userID` parameter.  Because `MyViewController` directly uses `self.userID` in an unsanitized `stringWithFormat:` call, the resulting query becomes:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1';DROP TABLE users;--'
    ```
    This could lead to the deletion of the `users` table.

**Scenario 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom Initialization**

*   **Vulnerable Code (MyViewController.m):**
    ```objectivec
    @interface MyViewController : UIViewController
    @property (nonatomic, strong) UILabel *itemNameLabel;
    - (id)initWithItemName:(NSString *)itemName;
    @end

    @implementation MyViewController
    - (id)initWithItemName:(NSString *)itemName {
        if ((self = [super init])) {
            self.itemNameLabel = [[UILabel alloc] init];
            self.itemNameLabel.text = itemName; // Directly setting the label text (BAD!)
            [self.view addSubview:self.itemNameLabel];
        }
        return self;
    }
    @end
    ```
*   **Attacker URL:**
    ```
    tt://myViewController/edit?itemName=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The attacker injects a JavaScript snippet into the `itemName` parameter.  Because `initWithItemName:` directly sets the `itemNameLabel.text` property without any encoding, the JavaScript code will be executed when the label is displayed.

**Scenario 3: Denial of Service (DoS) via URL Action Method**

*   **Vulnerable Code (MyViewController.m):**
    ```objectivec
    @interface MyViewController : UIViewController
    - (void)processDataWithParameters:(NSDictionary *)parameters;
    @end

    @implementation MyViewController
    - (void)processDataWithParameters:(NSDictionary *)parameters {
        NSString *dataSize = parameters[@"dataSize"];
        if (dataSize) {
            NSInteger size = [dataSize integerValue];
            // Allocate a large chunk of memory based on the parameter (BAD!)
            void *memory = malloc(size);
            // ... (potentially do something with the memory) ...
            free(memory);
        }
    }
    @end
    ```
*   **Attacker URL:**
    ```
    tt://myViewController/process?dataSize=1000000000
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The attacker provides a very large value for the `dataSize` parameter.  The `processDataWithParameters:` method attempts to allocate a huge amount of memory, potentially leading to a crash or denial of service.

**Scenario 4: Command Injection**
* **Vulnerable Code (MyViewController.m):**
    ```objectivec
        @interface MyViewController : UIViewController
            @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *command;
        @end

        @implementation MyViewController
            - (void)viewDidLoad {
                [super viewDidLoad];
                // Directly using the command property in system call (BAD!)
                if (self.command) {
                    system([self.command UTF8String]);
                }
            }
        @end
    ```
*   **Attacker URL:**
    ```
    tt://myViewController/edit?command=;reboot
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The attacker injects a malicious command into the `command` parameter. Because `MyViewController` directly uses `self.command` in an unsanitized `system` call, the resulting command becomes:
    ```
    ;reboot
    ```
    This could lead to the reboot of device.

**2.3.  Mitigation Strategies**

The key to preventing parameter injection vulnerabilities is to **never trust user input** and to **validate and sanitize all parameters** before using them.  Here are specific mitigation strategies:

1.  **Input Validation:**
    *   **Whitelist Approach (Strongly Recommended):**  Define a strict set of allowed values or patterns for each parameter.  Reject any input that doesn't match the whitelist.  For example, if `userID` is expected to be a positive integer, validate that it contains only digits and is within an acceptable range.
    *   **Blacklist Approach (Less Reliable):**  Try to identify and block known malicious patterns.  This is generally less effective than whitelisting because attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists.
    *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that parameters are of the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, date).  Use appropriate conversion methods (e.g., `integerValue`, `doubleValue`) and check for errors.

2.  **Output Encoding:**
    *   **Context-Specific Encoding:**  When displaying user-supplied data (e.g., in a label, text view, or web view), use appropriate encoding to prevent XSS.  For example:
        *   **HTML Encoding:**  Use a library function to escape HTML entities (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`).  iOS doesn't have a built-in HTML encoder for general strings, but you can find third-party libraries or create your own.  For `UIWebView`, you should ensure that you're loading data securely (e.g., using `loadHTMLString:baseURL:` with a safe base URL).
        *   **JavaScript Encoding:** If you're generating JavaScript code that includes user input, use appropriate escaping to prevent script injection.

3.  **Parameterized Queries (for SQL Injection):**
    *   **Never** construct SQL queries using string concatenation with user-supplied data.
    *   **Always** use parameterized queries (prepared statements) provided by the database API (e.g., SQLite's `sqlite3_prepare_v2`, `sqlite3_bind_*`, `sqlite3_step`).  This ensures that the database treats user input as data, not as part of the SQL command.

4.  **Safe API Usage:**
    *   Avoid using potentially dangerous functions like `system()` or `exec()` with user-supplied data.  If you must use them, ensure that the input is strictly validated and sanitized.
    *   Be cautious when using `stringWithFormat:`.  Always use format specifiers appropriately and ensure that user input is not directly used as a format string.

5.  **Resource Limits:**
    *   Implement limits on the size or amount of data that can be processed based on user input.  This can help prevent DoS attacks.
    *   Set timeouts for operations that might be vulnerable to DoS.

6.  **Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   Follow secure coding guidelines for iOS development.
    *   Regularly review code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Use static analysis tools to identify potential security issues.
    *   Conduct penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

7.  **Three20 Specific Recommendations:**

    *   **Avoid Direct Property Setting:**  Do *not* rely on `TTNavigator` to automatically set properties on your view controllers based on URL parameters.  This is inherently insecure.
    *   **Use Custom Initialization or URL Action Methods:**  Implement custom `init` methods or URL action methods that explicitly receive and *validate* parameters.
    *   **Centralized Validation:**  Consider creating a centralized validation mechanism (e.g., a helper class or category) to handle parameter validation for all view controllers.  This promotes consistency and reduces code duplication.
    *   **Review `TTNavigator` Customizations:** If you've customized `TTNavigator` (e.g., by subclassing or modifying its behavior), carefully review your changes for potential security implications.

**2.4. Detection During Code Reviews and Security Testing**

*   **Code Reviews:**
    *   Look for any instances where URL parameters are directly used without validation or sanitization.
    *   Check for the use of `stringWithFormat:` with user-supplied data.
    *   Verify that parameterized queries are used for all database interactions.
    *   Examine how view controllers are initialized and how parameters are passed to them.
    *   Look for the use of potentially dangerous functions (e.g., `system()`, `exec()`).

*   **Security Testing:**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of random or semi-random inputs for URL parameters and observe the application's behavior.  Look for crashes, errors, or unexpected results.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Attempt to manually exploit potential injection vulnerabilities using techniques like SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Fortify, Coverity) to automatically identify potential security issues in the code.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** Use tools like Instruments (for memory analysis and leak detection) or a web proxy (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) to intercept and modify network traffic and observe the application's response.

### 3. Conclusion

Parameter injection vulnerabilities in applications using Three20's `TTNavigator` are a serious concern.  The library's URL-based navigation system, while convenient, can easily lead to security flaws if developers are not careful.  By understanding how `TTNavigator` handles parameters and by implementing robust validation, sanitization, and secure coding practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these vulnerabilities.  Regular code reviews, security testing, and the use of appropriate tools are essential for identifying and mitigating these risks.  Since Three20 is archived, migrating to a more modern and actively maintained navigation solution is strongly recommended for long-term security and maintainability.
