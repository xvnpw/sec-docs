# Deep Analysis: SSRF via TTURLRequest in Three20

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability associated with the `TTURLRequest` class within the Three20 library.  We aim to understand the precise mechanisms by which this vulnerability can be exploited, identify the specific code patterns that introduce the risk, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and assess the overall impact on application security.  This analysis will inform development and security teams about the necessary steps to prevent and remediate this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target Component:**  The `TTURLRequest` class and its related methods within the Three20 library (https://github.com/facebookarchive/three20).  We will examine how this class handles URL creation and request execution.
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).  We will not analyze other potential vulnerabilities within Three20.
*   **Application Context:**  Applications that utilize Three20 for network requests, specifically where user-supplied data (e.g., input fields, URL parameters, headers) can influence the URL used in a `TTURLRequest`.
*   **Archived Status:** We acknowledge that Three20 is archived and no longer actively maintained.  This analysis is relevant for legacy applications still using the library and serves as a cautionary tale for similar patterns in modern libraries.

## 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the source code of `TTURLRequest` and related classes (e.g., `TTURLRequestQueue`, URL handling utilities) within the Three20 library.  We will look for:
        *   Lack of URL validation or sanitization.
        *   Direct use of user-supplied input in URL construction.
        *   Absence of allowlists or denylists for URL schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`, `file`, `gopher`).
        *   Insufficient checks on response codes or content that could indicate an SSRF attempt.
    *   Identify any existing security mechanisms (if any) intended to prevent SSRF.
    *   Analyze how `TTURLRequest` interacts with lower-level networking APIs (e.g., `NSURLRequest`, `NSURLConnection` or `NSURLSession`).

2.  **Hypothetical Exploit Scenario Development:**
    *   Construct realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit the SSRF vulnerability.  This will include:
        *   Identifying potential input vectors (e.g., a profile picture URL field, a "fetch content from URL" feature).
        *   Crafting malicious URLs targeting internal services (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin`, `file:///etc/passwd`, `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`).
        *   Describing the expected attacker outcome (e.g., accessing internal API endpoints, reading local files, retrieving cloud metadata).

3.  **Mitigation Strategy Recommendation:**
    *   Propose specific, actionable steps to mitigate the SSRF vulnerability.  This will include:
        *   Implementing robust URL validation using allowlists (preferred) or denylists.
        *   Using a dedicated URL parsing and validation library.
        *   Avoiding direct concatenation of user input with URL components.
        *   Considering network-level restrictions (e.g., firewall rules) to limit outbound connections from the application server.
        *   Implementing robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data.
        *   Recommending migration away from the archived Three20 library to a modern, actively maintained alternative.

4.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   Re-evaluate the impact and likelihood of the vulnerability based on the findings of the code review and exploit scenarios.
    *   Consider the potential consequences of a successful SSRF attack, including data breaches, service disruption, and potential for remote code execution (RCE).

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SSRF via `TTURLRequest`

### 4.1 Code Review Findings

Based on a review of the Three20 source code (specifically, `TTURLRequest` and related files), the following observations are crucial:

*   **Primary Vulnerability Point:** The core issue lies in how `TTURLRequest` constructs and sends requests.  It relies on `NSURLRequest` (or potentially `NSURLConnection` in older versions) to handle the actual network communication.  The vulnerability arises when the URL passed to `TTURLRequest` is directly or indirectly derived from user input *without proper validation*.

*   **Lack of Built-in Validation:**  `TTURLRequest` itself does *not* perform any significant URL validation beyond what `NSURLRequest` inherently provides.  `NSURLRequest` does some basic parsing and validation, but it's *not* designed to prevent SSRF.  It will happily create requests to `file://`, `http://localhost`, or other potentially dangerous schemes if the provided string is a syntactically valid URL.

*   **Delegation to `NSURLRequest`:**  The responsibility for handling the URL and making the request is largely delegated to `NSURLRequest`.  This means that any SSRF protections must be implemented *before* the URL is passed to `TTURLRequest`.

*   **`TTURLRequestQueue` Interaction:**  While `TTURLRequestQueue` manages the queuing and execution of requests, it doesn't add any SSRF-specific security measures.  It simply processes the `TTURLRequest` objects it receives.

*   **No Allowlist/Denylist:**  The Three20 library, in its original form, does not provide any built-in mechanisms for allowlisting or denylisting URLs or URL schemes.  This is a significant security gap.

### 4.2 Hypothetical Exploit Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Profile Picture URL**

1.  **Input Vector:**  A user profile page allows users to specify a URL for their profile picture.
2.  **Attacker Action:**  The attacker provides a malicious URL: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/role-name` (This is a common AWS metadata endpoint).
3.  **Application Behavior:**  The application uses `TTURLRequest` to fetch the image from the provided URL.  No validation is performed.
4.  **Attacker Outcome:**  The server makes a request to the AWS metadata service.  The response, containing sensitive IAM credentials, is potentially processed by the application (e.g., displayed as the profile picture or stored in a database).  The attacker can then retrieve these credentials.

**Scenario 2: "Fetch Content from URL" Feature**

1.  **Input Vector:**  The application has a feature that allows users to enter a URL and fetch its content (e.g., to preview a link or embed content).
2.  **Attacker Action:**  The attacker enters `file:///etc/passwd`.
3.  **Application Behavior:**  The application uses `TTURLRequest` to fetch the content from the provided URL.
4.  **Attacker Outcome:**  The server reads the `/etc/passwd` file from its local filesystem.  The contents of this file (containing user account information) are returned to the attacker.

**Scenario 3: Internal API Access**

1.  **Input Vector:** A URL parameter in a seemingly harmless API endpoint is used to construct a URL for an internal service.
2.  **Attacker Action:** The attacker manipulates the URL parameter to point to an internal API endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/admin/users`.
3.  **Application Behavior:** The application uses `TTURLRequest` to make a request to the internal API.
4.  **Attacker Outcome:** The attacker gains access to the internal `/admin/users` endpoint, potentially allowing them to view, modify, or delete user data.

### 4.3 Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Strict URL Allowlisting (Strongly Recommended):**
    *   Define a precise list of allowed URL schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`) and domains.
    *   *Before* creating a `TTURLRequest`, validate the user-supplied URL against this allowlist.  Reject any URL that doesn't match.
    *   Example (Conceptual - needs adaptation to Objective-C):

        ```objectivec
        // Allowed domains and schemes
        NSArray *allowedDomains = @[@"example.com", @"cdn.example.com"];
        NSArray *allowedSchemes = @[@"http", @"https"];

        // User-supplied URL (from input)
        NSString *userURLString = ...;

        // Parse the URL
        NSURL *userURL = [NSURL URLWithString:userURLString];

        // Validate the scheme
        if (![allowedSchemes containsObject:userURL.scheme]) {
            // Reject the URL - invalid scheme
            return; // Or handle the error appropriately
        }

        // Validate the domain
        BOOL domainAllowed = NO;
        for (NSString *allowedDomain in allowedDomains) {
            if ([userURL.host isEqualToString:allowedDomain] || [userURL.host hasSuffix:[@"." stringByAppendingString:allowedDomain]]) {
                domainAllowed = YES;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!domainAllowed) {
            // Reject the URL - invalid domain
            return; // Or handle the error appropriately
        }

        // If validation passes, create the TTURLRequest
        TTURLRequest *request = [TTURLRequest requestWithURL:userURLString delegate:self];
        // ...
        ```

2.  **URL Parsing and Validation Library:**
    *   Use a dedicated URL parsing and validation library (if available) to ensure that the URL is well-formed and meets security requirements.  This can help prevent subtle parsing inconsistencies that could lead to bypasses.

3.  **Avoid Direct Concatenation:**
    *   Never directly concatenate user input with URL components.  Always use proper URL encoding and construction methods.

4.  **Network-Level Restrictions:**
    *   Configure firewall rules to restrict outbound connections from the application server.  Only allow connections to known, trusted external services.  Block access to internal IP address ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`) and the cloud metadata service IP (`169.254.169.254`).

5.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* user-supplied data, not just URLs.  This helps prevent other injection vulnerabilities that could be combined with SSRF.

6.  **Migration to a Modern Library (Highest Priority):**
    *   Since Three20 is archived, the *best* long-term solution is to migrate to a modern, actively maintained networking library like `NSURLSession`.  `NSURLSession` provides more built-in security features and is actively updated to address security vulnerabilities.  This migration should be prioritized.

7.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect unusual network activity.  Log all outgoing requests, including the full URL, and set up alerts for requests to internal IP addresses or suspicious domains.

### 4.4 Impact Assessment (Re-evaluation)

*   **Likelihood:** High.  Given the lack of built-in validation in `TTURLRequest` and the common practice of using user-supplied URLs, the likelihood of this vulnerability existing in applications using Three20 is high.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High.  Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   **Data Breaches:** Access to sensitive internal data, including database contents, API keys, and cloud credentials.
    *   **Service Disruption:** Attackers could potentially disrupt internal services by sending malicious requests.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If an internal service is vulnerable to RCE, SSRF could be used as a stepping stone to achieve full system compromise.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Finding a vulnerable endpoint might require some reconnaissance, but crafting the SSRF payload itself is often straightforward.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.  Basic understanding of HTTP and URL structures is required.  Exploiting more complex scenarios (e.g., accessing internal APIs) might require more advanced knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  Server logs might show unusual requests, but the attacker's IP address is masked.  Detecting SSRF often requires correlating requests and identifying patterns of malicious behavior.

## 5. Conclusion

The SSRF vulnerability via `TTURLRequest` in Three20 is a serious security concern.  The lack of built-in URL validation makes it relatively easy for attackers to exploit this vulnerability if user-supplied data influences the URLs used in network requests.  The recommended mitigation strategies, particularly strict URL allowlisting and migration to a modern networking library, are crucial for protecting applications from this attack.  The archived status of Three20 further emphasizes the need for migration to ensure ongoing security and maintainability.
