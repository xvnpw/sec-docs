## Threat: [Excessive Shimmer Instance Creation (DoS)](./threats/excessive_shimmer_instance_creation__dos_.md)

**1. Threat: Excessive Shimmer Instance Creation (DoS)**

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to trigger the creation of a very large number of Shimmer instances simultaneously. This could be achieved if the application dynamically creates Shimmer instances based on user input (which it should *not* do). This directly leverages the Shimmer library's instantiation mechanism.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Slows down the application significantly, potentially making it unusable.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Client-Side):** Could consume excessive CPU or GPU resources on the user's device, leading to browser crashes or freezes in extreme cases. This directly impacts the user's device.
*   **Affected Shimmer Component:** The code responsible for creating and managing Shimmer instances. This would depend on how Shimmer is integrated into the application, but it would likely involve the main Shimmer component (e.g., `Shimmer`, `ShimmerFrameLayout`) and any surrounding logic that controls its instantiation. This is a *direct* interaction with the library's core functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Due to the archived nature of the library. If it were maintained, this would be Medium).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Instance Control:**  Do *not* allow user input to directly control the number or complexity of Shimmer instances. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Indirect):** If Shimmer instances are created in response to user actions (e.g., scrolling), implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from triggering a flood of requests.
    *   **Lazy Loading:** Only initialize Shimmer effects when the corresponding elements are about to become visible in the viewport.
    *   **Limit Total Instances:**  Enforce a hard limit on the maximum number of Shimmer instances that can be active at any given time.
