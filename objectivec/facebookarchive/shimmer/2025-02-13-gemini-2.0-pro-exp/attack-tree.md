## Attack Tree Path: [1. Degrade User Experience [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__degrade_user_experience__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker aims to make the application slow, unresponsive, or visually unpleasant by exploiting how the Shimmer component is used. This degrades the user experience without necessarily causing a complete crash.
    *   **Overall Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Overall Impact:** Medium
    *   **Overall Effort:** Low
    *   **Overall Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Overall Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Excessive Resource Consumption (DoS-like) {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__excessive_resource_consumption__dos-like__{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to overload the application by causing the Shimmer component to consume excessive CPU or memory resources. This can lead to slowdowns, freezes, or even browser crashes.
        *   **Overall Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Overall Impact:** Medium
        *   **Overall Effort:** Low
        *   **Overall Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Overall Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Trigger Excessive Re-renders [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__trigger_excessive_re-renders__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability where the application rapidly updates the properties (props) of the Shimmer component.  If the application doesn't handle these updates efficiently (e.g., with debouncing or throttling), this can lead to excessive re-renders of the Shimmer effect, consuming significant resources.
            *   **Overall Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Overall Impact:** Medium
            *   **Overall Effort:** Low
            *   **Overall Skill Level:** Beginner
            *   **Overall Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Rapidly Changing Props (if poorly implemented) {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__rapidly_changing_props__if_poorly_implemented__{critical}.md)

*   **Description:**  This is the specific mechanism for triggering excessive re-renders.  The attacker might manipulate user input, network requests, or other factors that influence the props passed to Shimmer, causing them to change very rapidly.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** Medium
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement debouncing or throttling on prop updates to the Shimmer component.  Rate-limit updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Large Number of Shimmer Instances {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__large_number_of_shimmer_instances_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker causes the application to render a very large number of Shimmer components simultaneously.  Each Shimmer instance consumes resources, so a large number can overwhelm the browser.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
            *   **Mitigation:** Limit the number of simultaneously displayed Shimmer components. Use pagination or lazy loading.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) - Specific to Shimmer Component](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos__-_specific_to_shimmer_component.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to make the Shimmer component itself unusable, either by crashing it or freezing its animation. This is a more targeted DoS than the resource consumption attacks.
    * **Overall Likelihood:** Low
    * **Overall Impact:** Medium
    * **Overall Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Overall Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Overall Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Crash Shimmer Component (if possible)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__crash_shimmer_component__if_possible_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker tries to find inputs or conditions that cause the Shimmer component to crash, resulting in an error or blank space where the shimmer effect should be.
        * **Overall Likelihood:** Low
        * **Overall Impact:** Medium
        * **Overall Effort:** Low to Medium
        * **Overall Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        * **Overall Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Provide Invalid Props {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__provide_invalid_props_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides intentionally invalid or unexpected values for the properties (props) of the Shimmer component.  If the component doesn't handle these invalid props gracefully, it might crash.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming good input validation); High (without validation)
            *   **Impact:** Medium
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust prop type validation and error handling. Use TypeScript or similar for strong typing. Sanitize all inputs.
