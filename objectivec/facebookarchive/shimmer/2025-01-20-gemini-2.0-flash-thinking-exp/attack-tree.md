# Attack Tree Analysis for facebookarchive/shimmer

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data processed or displayed by the application, or manipulate the application's behavior by exploiting Shimmer's functionalities.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Compromise Application Using Shimmer [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   Bypass Shimmer Masking **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Disable JavaScript
        *   Goal Achieved: User disables JavaScript, preventing Shimmer from executing and revealing underlying data.
*   Exploit Shimmer's Masking Logic **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Reverse-Engineer Masking Patterns
        *   Goal Achieved: Attacker analyzes the Shimmer configuration and masking patterns used by the application to develop techniques for reversing the masking and revealing the original data.
    *   Exploit Client-Side Logic Flaws
        *   Goal Achieved: Attacker identifies vulnerabilities in the application's JavaScript code that interacts with Shimmer, allowing them to manipulate the masking process or access unmasked data before it's processed by Shimmer.
*   Abuse Application's Reliance on Shimmer **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Inject Malicious Content Before Shimmer
        *   Goal Achieved: Attacker injects malicious HTML or JavaScript into the page before Shimmer is initialized, potentially compromising the application before masking occurs.
    *   Exploit Misconfiguration of Shimmer
        *   Goal Achieved: Attacker identifies misconfigurations in how the application uses Shimmer, such as incorrect selectors, insufficient masking rules, or improper handling of edge cases, leading to data exposure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Shimmer Masking](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_shimmer_masking.md)

**Attack Vector: Disable JavaScript**
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Low
*   Detection Difficulty: Low
*   Description: An attacker (or even a regular user) disables JavaScript in their browser settings. This prevents Shimmer from executing, and any data intended to be masked client-side will be displayed in its unmasked form.
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement server-side filtering and sanitization of sensitive data.
    *   Avoid relying solely on client-side masking for security.
    *   Consider alternative ways to present sensitive data when JavaScript is disabled (though this can be complex).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Shimmer's Masking Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shimmer's_masking_logic.md)

**Attack Vector: Reverse-Engineer Masking Patterns**
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Medium
*   Skill Level: Medium
*   Detection Difficulty: Low
*   Description: An attacker analyzes the JavaScript code, Shimmer configuration, and observed masking patterns to understand how the masking is implemented. With this knowledge, they can develop techniques to reverse the masking and reveal the original data.
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Use complex and unpredictable masking patterns.
    *   Obfuscate the Shimmer configuration if possible.
    *   Consider server-side masking for highly sensitive data.
    *   Regularly review and update masking configurations.

**Attack Vector: Exploit Client-Side Logic Flaws**
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Medium
*   Skill Level: Medium
*   Detection Difficulty: Low
*   Description: Vulnerabilities in the application's own JavaScript code that interacts with Shimmer can be exploited. This could involve manipulating how Shimmer is called, accessing data before it's masked, or bypassing the masking logic altogether.
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement secure coding practices for all JavaScript code.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on the integration with Shimmer.
    *   Perform static and dynamic analysis of the JavaScript code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Application's Reliance on Shimmer](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_application's_reliance_on_shimmer.md)

**Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Content Before Shimmer**
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High
*   Effort: Low to Medium
*   Skill Level: Medium
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   Description: If the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the page. This code executes before Shimmer is initialized, potentially compromising the application before any masking can occur.
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement robust XSS prevention measures: input validation, output encoding, Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vector: Exploit Misconfiguration of Shimmer**
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: Medium to High
*   Effort: Low to Medium
*   Skill Level: Low to Medium
*   Detection Difficulty: Low
*   Description: Incorrect configuration of Shimmer, such as using wrong CSS selectors, insufficient masking rules, or improper handling of edge cases, can lead to data being displayed unmasked or partially masked.
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Carefully configure Shimmer and thoroughly test the configuration.
    *   Use a consistent and well-defined approach to masking.
    *   Regularly review and update the Shimmer configuration as the application evolves.
    *   Provide clear documentation and training for developers on Shimmer configuration.
