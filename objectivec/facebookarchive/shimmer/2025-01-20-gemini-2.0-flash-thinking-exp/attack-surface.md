## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Shimmer Configuration](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_shimmer_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the application by manipulating the configuration data used to generate Shimmer placeholders. This script executes in the victim's browser when the placeholder is rendered.
    *   **How Shimmer Contributes:** If the application allows user-controlled input (directly or indirectly) to influence Shimmer's configuration (e.g., colors, shapes, text content within the placeholder), it creates an avenue for injecting arbitrary HTML and JavaScript. Shimmer then renders this malicious content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a URL parameter or form field that is used to set the background color of a Shimmer placeholder. Instead of a color code, they inject `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`. When the placeholder is rendered, the JavaScript `alert('XSS')` executes.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's session, redirection to malicious sites, stealing of sensitive information, defacement of the application, or execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict Input Validation:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs that could potentially influence Shimmer's configuration on the server-side.
        *   Output Encoding: Encode any dynamic data used in Shimmer configurations before rendering it in the HTML to prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   Avoid User-Controlled Configuration: Minimize or eliminate the ability for users to directly control Shimmer's configuration. If necessary, provide a limited and strictly validated set of options.
