# Threat Model Analysis for facebookarchive/shimmer

## Threat: [Client-Side Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Placeholder Rendering](./threats/client-side_resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_placeholder_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application's logic or API calls to trigger the rendering of an extremely large number of Shimmer placeholders. This could be achieved by sending requests that imply a massive dataset is loading, even if it's not. The attacker aims to overwhelm the victim's browser by forcing it to allocate significant resources to render these placeholders.

**Impact:** The victim's browser may become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) on the client-side. This can disrupt the user experience, potentially causing frustration and forcing the user to close the tab or browser.

**Affected Component:** Shimmer's core rendering logic, specifically the functions responsible for creating and displaying the placeholder elements.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the number of Shimmer placeholders rendered based on expected data volumes.
*   Use pagination or lazy loading techniques to avoid loading and displaying large datasets at once.
*   Implement timeouts or cancellation mechanisms for long-running data requests that trigger Shimmer.
*   Monitor client-side performance and resource usage to detect potential abuse.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Shimmer Distribution](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_shimmer_distribution.md)

**Description:**  A sophisticated attacker could potentially compromise the Shimmer repository or its distribution channels (e.g., package managers). This could involve injecting malicious code into the library itself, which would then be included in applications using Shimmer.

**Impact:**  If the Shimmer library is compromised, any application using it could be vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, including remote code execution, data theft, and backdoors.

**Affected Component:** The entire Shimmer library as distributed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Verify the integrity of the Shimmer library when including it in your project using checksums or other verification methods.
*   Be cautious about using unofficial or forked versions of the library.
*   Implement security measures to protect your own build and deployment pipeline from supply chain attacks.
*   Monitor for any unusual activity or changes in the Shimmer library's repository or distribution channels.
