## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Data Rendered After Shimmer](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_data_rendered_after_shimmer.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Sanitize Data Rendered After Shimmer

*   **Description:**
    1.  Specifically identify all application components where dynamic content replaces Shimmer placeholders once loading is complete.
    2.  For each of these components, meticulously analyze the data being rendered and its source.
    3.  Implement robust output encoding or sanitization *specifically for this dynamically loaded data* to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Focus on the context where this data is inserted into the DOM after Shimmer disappears.
    4.  Utilize appropriate sanitization libraries (like DOMPurify for HTML in JavaScript) to process the data *before* it replaces the Shimmer effect.
    5.  Conduct targeted testing on these components to ensure that XSS is prevented in the content rendered after Shimmer.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:**  Malicious scripts can be injected through unsanitized data that replaces Shimmer placeholders, leading to account compromise, data theft, and other attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS Mitigation - Significant Impact:**  Directly addresses and significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from dynamic content loaded after Shimmer is displayed.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented - General Backend Sanitization:** Backend systems might sanitize data, but frontend sanitization specifically for content replacing Shimmer might be inconsistent or overlooked.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Frontend-Specific Sanitization for Shimmer Replacement Content:**  Explicit implementation of output encoding and sanitization in frontend components responsible for rendering data *after* Shimmer effects are removed.  Lack of focused code review on this specific aspect.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Shimmer Usage in Security-Sensitive Areas](./mitigation_strategies/limit_shimmer_usage_in_security-sensitive_areas.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Limit Shimmer Usage in Security-Sensitive Areas

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify application views or components that display sensitive user data and currently utilize Shimmer as a loading indicator.
    2.  Re-evaluate the necessity of Shimmer in these *security-sensitive areas*. Consider if the visual benefit outweighs the potential for reduced security vigilance.
    3.  If Shimmer is retained, implement heightened security scrutiny for the data loading and rendering processes in these areas, ensuring no security measures are relaxed due to the presence of Shimmer.
    4.  Explore alternative loading indicators (e.g., simple spinners) for sensitive areas if they promote a stronger focus on security compared to using Shimmer's placeholder content.
    5.  Prioritize optimizing data loading speed in sensitive areas to minimize loading times and reduce the perceived need for Shimmer, thus reducing potential indirect security risks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Oversight due to False Sense of Security - Medium Severity:**  The visual distraction of Shimmer might inadvertently lead developers to pay less attention to the security of the content that replaces it, especially in sensitive areas.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Indirect) - Low to Medium Severity:** If Shimmer usage contributes to rushed or less secure data loading implementations in sensitive areas, it could indirectly increase the risk of information disclosure.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Oversight Reduction - Moderate Impact:** By limiting Shimmer in sensitive contexts, it encourages a more deliberate and security-focused approach to handling sensitive data loading and display.
    *   **Information Disclosure Risk Reduction - Minor to Moderate Impact:** Indirectly reduces the risk by promoting better security practices in areas where sensitive information is displayed, even if Shimmer itself is not directly vulnerable.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Not Explicitly Implemented - UI/UX driven Shimmer usage:** Shimmer usage is likely determined by UI/UX design without specific security considerations for sensitive data areas.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Security-Driven Guidelines for Shimmer Usage in Sensitive Areas:**  Establish internal guidelines that restrict or carefully control Shimmer usage in components displaying sensitive information. Integrate these guidelines into security training and design reviews.
