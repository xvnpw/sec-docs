## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration Injection](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when malicious scripts are injected into a website and executed in a user's browser. This can happen when user-controlled data is improperly handled and rendered in the DOM, even in the context of configuring UI elements.
*   **How Shimmer Contributes:**  If application developers dynamically configure Shimmer animations using unsanitized user input, it can create an XSS vulnerability.  While Shimmer itself doesn't process user content, misuse of its configuration can be exploited.  Specifically, if animation styles or attributes are set based on user-provided data without proper sanitization.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious payload in a query parameter intended to control Shimmer's animation style. If the application directly uses this parameter to set Shimmer's style attribute without sanitization, the malicious script could be injected and executed when Shimmer renders.
    *   `https://example.com/page?shimmer_style="<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>"` - If the application uses `shimmer_style` parameter to directly set the `style` attribute of a Shimmer element.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, stealing sensitive user data, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Absolutely avoid directly using unsanitized user input to configure Shimmer animations or any DOM manipulation. Sanitize and validate all external data before using it in Shimmer configurations. Use appropriate encoding and escaping techniques.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks. Configure CSP to restrict inline scripts and styles, and only allow resources from trusted origins.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Periodically audit the application code, specifically focusing on areas where Shimmer configuration is dynamic, to identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/client-side_denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Client-side Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to make an application unusable by legitimate users through excessive resource consumption within the user's browser.
*   **How Shimmer Contributes:**
    *   **Overly Complex Animations:**  Using excessively complex or resource-intensive Shimmer animations, especially in large numbers, can overload the user's browser, consuming excessive CPU and memory.
    *   **Unbounded Animation Generation:** Dynamically generating a very large number of Shimmer animations based on uncontrolled factors can lead to resource exhaustion and browser unresponsiveness.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker manipulates input to cause the application to render an extremely large number of Shimmer loading animations simultaneously on a single page (e.g., thousands or tens of thousands). This can overwhelm the user's browser, leading to a freeze or crash.
    *   A developer unintentionally creates a scenario where Shimmer animations are continuously added to the DOM without proper removal or recycling, leading to memory leaks and eventual browser DoS.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unusable or extremely slow for legitimate users, leading to a severe degradation of user experience and effectively denying service on the client-side. Browser crashes can also occur.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Optimize Animation Complexity:** Design Shimmer animations to be lightweight and efficient. Avoid unnecessary complexity in animations and minimize the number of animated elements.
    *   **Limit Animation Count:** Implement controls to limit the number of Shimmer animations rendered simultaneously, especially when dealing with dynamic content. Use techniques like pagination or virtualization to manage large datasets.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling (Client-Side):** Monitor client-side performance metrics. If resource usage (CPU, memory) becomes excessive due to Shimmer animations, implement throttling or adaptive degradation strategies to reduce animation complexity or count.
    *   **Performance Testing and Load Testing (Client-Side):** Conduct thorough performance testing, simulating various load conditions and user scenarios, to identify and address potential client-side DoS vulnerabilities related to Shimmer usage. Test on low-powered devices as well.
    *   **Lazy Loading and Virtualization:** For lists or grids, implement lazy loading or virtualization to render Shimmer animations only for visible items, significantly reducing the number of active animations and resource consumption.
