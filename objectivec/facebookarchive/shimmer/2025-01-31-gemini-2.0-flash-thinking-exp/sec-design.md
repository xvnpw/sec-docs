# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Shimmer, is a JavaScript library designed to enhance user experience in web applications by providing performant loading placeholders. The primary business goal is to improve user perceived performance and reduce user frustration during content loading. This contributes to better user engagement and satisfaction with web applications that integrate Shimmer.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of decreased user experience if Shimmer library itself introduces performance issues or visual glitches.
- Risk of developer adoption failure if the library is difficult to use, poorly documented, or incompatible with common web development frameworks.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in the Shimmer library that could be exploited in web applications using it, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks.
- Risk of supply chain attacks if the library or its dependencies are compromised, affecting all applications that use it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Repository hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub)
- security control: Open source project, allowing community review and contributions. (Implemented: GitHub)
- accepted risk: Reliance on JavaScript ecosystem and npm for dependency management, which can introduce supply chain risks.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Provide clear documentation and examples on secure usage of the library, especially regarding input handling if the library accepts any configuration.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a client-side library. However, if the library interacts with any backend services (which is not apparent from the description), authentication would be a requirement for those interactions.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a client-side library. Authorization would be relevant in the context of the web applications that use Shimmer, to control access to the content being loaded.
- Input validation: If Shimmer library accepts any configuration options or data from the web application, it must perform input validation to prevent injection attacks. For example, if Shimmer allows customization of placeholder styles via user-provided strings, these strings must be carefully sanitized to prevent XSS.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to Shimmer library as a placeholder rendering component. Cryptography would be relevant for the web applications using Shimmer if they handle sensitive data.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Maintaining a positive user experience in web applications by providing loading placeholders.
- Ensuring developer trust and adoption of the Shimmer library.
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Shimmer library package in the npm registry.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of the Shimmer library: Sensitive as it represents the intellectual property and contains the logic of the library. Confidentiality and integrity are important.
- Build artifacts (JavaScript library package): Integrity and availability are crucial to ensure users download and use a safe and functional library.
- User data within web applications using Shimmer: While Shimmer itself doesn't directly handle user data, the web applications that use it do. The sensitivity of this data depends on the specific application and is outside the direct scope of Shimmer library's risk assessment, but is indirectly relevant as Shimmer is part of the application's ecosystem.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended scope of customization for the Shimmer library? Does it accept user-provided styles or scripts? If so, input validation and output encoding become critical security requirements.
- Are there any backend services or APIs that the Shimmer library interacts with (even indirectly)? If so, authentication and authorization considerations would be relevant.
- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in the Shimmer library?
- What is the expected lifetime and maintenance plan for the Shimmer library?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve user experience in web applications by providing loading placeholders. The library is intended for general use in web development.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows basic secure development practices, including using version control and open-source principles. Security scanning and dependency management are recommended but not explicitly stated as existing controls.
- DESIGN: The Shimmer library is primarily a client-side JavaScript library. It is distributed via npm and used in web applications running in web browsers. The build process involves standard JavaScript build tools and practices.
