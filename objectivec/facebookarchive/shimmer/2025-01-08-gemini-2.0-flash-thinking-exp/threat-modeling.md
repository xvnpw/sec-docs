# Threat Model Analysis for facebookarchive/shimmer

## Threat: [Malicious Modification of Shimmer JavaScript](./threats/malicious_modification_of_shimmer_javascript.md)

**Description:** An attacker capable of injecting or modifying JavaScript (e.g., through XSS) could alter the Shimmer library's behavior. This could involve preventing the shimmer from appearing, making it appear indefinitely, or even triggering malicious actions when the shimmer is displayed or removed.

**Impact:**
- **Denial of Service (Client-Side):** Malicious JavaScript could create infinite loops or resource-intensive operations when the shimmer is active, freezing the user's browser.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The attacker could potentially intercept or log data related to the loading process that is being managed by the application and the shimmer effect.
- **UI Manipulation:**  The attacker could manipulate the UI in unexpected ways when the shimmer is supposed to appear or disappear.

**Affected Component:** Shimmer JavaScript modules and functions.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
- Employ Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure that the Shimmer library loaded is the expected version and hasn't been tampered with.
- Avoid directly embedding user-controlled data within JavaScript code that interacts with Shimmer.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Shimmer Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_shimmer_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The Shimmer library might rely on other client-side libraries or dependencies. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them through the application.

**Impact:**
- **Various Client-Side Attacks:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the browser, or other client-side attacks.

**Affected Component:** Shimmer's dependencies (e.g., any underlying JavaScript libraries it might use).

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical to High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly update the Shimmer library to the latest version, which will often include updates to its dependencies.
- Utilize dependency management tools to track and update Shimmer's dependencies.
- Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues related to Shimmer and its dependencies.
- Employ Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Shimmer and its dependencies to ensure integrity.
