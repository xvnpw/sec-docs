## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Shimmer](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_shimmer.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and encompasses all potential attack vectors leveraging the Shimmer library. Success means the attacker has gained unauthorized access or control over the application or its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Animation Logic for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_animation_logic_for_malicious_purposes.md)

This category of attacks focuses on manipulating the intended behavior of Shimmer animations to achieve malicious goals. This can range from subtle UI manipulation to resource exhaustion and bypassing security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Animation Timing to Bypass Security Checks](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_animation_timing_to_bypass_security_checks.md)

**DETAILS:** Alter animation durations or delays to create race conditions or bypass security checks tied to UI elements appearing or disappearing.

**IMPACT:** High - Circumventing UI-based security, triggering unintended actions.

**LIKELIHOOD:** Low

**EFFORT:** Medium

**SKILL LEVEL:** Medium

**DETECTION DIFFICULTY:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Animations in Security-Sensitive Contexts](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_animations_in_security-sensitive_contexts.md)

**DETAILS:** Force Shimmer animations to occur during critical security processes (e.g., authentication), potentially disrupting or bypassing them.

**IMPACT:** High - Authentication bypass, access control issues.

**LIKELIHOOD:** Low

**EFFORT:** Medium

**SKILL LEVEL:** Medium

**DETECTION DIFFICULTY:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Flaws with Shimmer](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_flaws_with_shimmer.md)

This category highlights vulnerabilities arising from how the application developers have integrated the Shimmer library. Improper handling of asynchronous operations or triggering animations in sensitive contexts can create significant security risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Graphics Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_graphics_libraries.md)

**DETAILS:** While not directly a Shimmer vulnerability, if Shimmer relies on vulnerable graphics libraries, these could be exploited to compromise the application. (Requires understanding Shimmer's dependencies).

**IMPACT:** High - Application crash, potential for remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability).

**LIKELIHOOD:** Very Low

**EFFORT:** High

**SKILL LEVEL:** High

**DETECTION DIFFICULTY:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Animation Logic for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_animation_logic_for_malicious_purposes.md)

This path encompasses several techniques to misuse Shimmer's animation capabilities.
    * **Cause Unexpected Visual Behavior:** Manipulating animation parameters to mislead users.
    * **Trigger Resource Intensive Animations:**  Overloading the application with numerous or complex animations leading to performance issues.
    * **Manipulate Animation Timing to Bypass Security Checks:** Exploiting timing dependencies in security logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Resource Intensive Animations](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_resource_intensive_animations.md)

**DETAILS:** Force the application to execute complex or numerous Shimmer animations simultaneously, leading to performance degradation or denial of service.

**IMPACT:** Medium - Application slowdown, temporary unavailability, battery drain.

**LIKELIHOOD:** Medium

**EFFORT:** Low

**SKILL LEVEL:** Low

**DETECTION DIFFICULTY:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Animation Timing to Bypass Security Checks](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_animation_timing_to_bypass_security_checks.md)

**DETAILS:** Alter animation durations or delays to create race conditions or bypass security checks tied to UI elements appearing or disappearing.

**IMPACT:** High - Circumventing UI-based security, triggering unintended actions.

**LIKELIHOOD:** Low

**EFFORT:** Medium

**SKILL LEVEL:** Medium

**DETECTION DIFFICULTY:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Flaws with Shimmer](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_flaws_with_shimmer.md)

This path highlights the risks associated with improper integration of Shimmer.
    * **Trigger Animations in Security-Sensitive Contexts:**  Interfering with security processes through animations.
    * **Abuse Asynchronous Nature of Animations:** Exploiting the non-blocking nature of animations to create race conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Animations in Security-Sensitive Contexts](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_animations_in_security-sensitive_contexts.md)

**DETAILS:** Force Shimmer animations to occur during critical security processes (e.g., authentication), potentially disrupting or bypassing them.

**IMPACT:** High - Authentication bypass, access control issues.

**LIKELIHOOD:** Low

**EFFORT:** Medium

**SKILL LEVEL:** Medium

**DETECTION DIFFICULTY:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Asynchronous Nature of Animations](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_asynchronous_nature_of_animations.md)

**DETAILS:** Exploit the asynchronous nature of Shimmer animations to create race conditions or manipulate application state before or after an animation completes.

**IMPACT:** Medium - Inconsistent application state, potential for data corruption.

**LIKELIHOOD:** Medium

**EFFORT:** Medium

**SKILL LEVEL:** Medium

**DETECTION DIFFICULTY:** High
