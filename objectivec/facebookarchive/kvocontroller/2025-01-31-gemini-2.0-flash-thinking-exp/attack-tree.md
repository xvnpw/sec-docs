## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via kvocontroller [Root Node]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_kvocontroller__root_node_.md)

Critical Node, High-Risk Path
    * **Attack Vector:** This is the root goal. Exploiting vulnerabilities related to `kvocontroller` to compromise the application. It's critical because success means application compromise, and it's a high-risk path because developer misuse (the next level down) is a likely avenue to achieve this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misuse of kvocontroller API by Developers](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_of_kvocontroller_api_by_developers.md)

Critical Node, High-Risk Path
    * **Attack Vector:** Developers incorrectly using the `kvocontroller` API, leading to vulnerabilities in the application. This is critical as it's a common source of security issues and a high-risk path because developer errors are a likely occurrence.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Improper Observer Registration/Deregistration](./attack_tree_paths/1__improper_observer_registrationderegistration.md)

High-Risk Path
    * **Attack Vector:** Developers failing to correctly register and, more importantly, deregister observers when they are no longer needed. This leads to resource leaks and potential unexpected behavior. It's a high-risk path due to the likelihood of developer oversight in complex applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Memory Leaks & Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_memory_leaks_&_resource_exhaustion.md)

High-Risk Path
        * **Attack Vector:** Accumulation of observers due to improper deregistration leading to memory leaks and resource exhaustion. This is a high-risk path because memory leaks are a common programming error and can lead to denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Fail to deregister observers leading to accumulation of observers](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_fail_to_deregister_observers_leading_to_accumulation_of_observers.md)

High-Risk Path
            * **Attack Vector:** The specific coding error of forgetting to call the deregistration methods provided by `kvocontroller`. This is a high-risk path as it's a direct cause of memory leaks in this context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit: Trigger frequent KVO notifications to exhaust resources (memory, CPU)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_trigger_frequent_kvo_notifications_to_exhaust_resources__memory__cpu_.md)

High-Risk Path
                * **Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers actions that cause the application to repeatedly register observers without proper deregistration. By then triggering frequent KVO notifications, the accumulated observers consume resources, leading to denial of service. This is a high-risk path because it's relatively easy for an attacker to trigger application actions and KVO notifications.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Incorrect Key Path Handling](./attack_tree_paths/2__incorrect_key_path_handling.md)

High-Risk Path
    * **Attack Vector:** Developers making mistakes in choosing or handling key paths used for observation, leading to unintended information exposure or manipulation. This is a high-risk path because incorrect key path handling can directly expose sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Observing Sensitive Key Paths Unintentionally](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_observing_sensitive_key_paths_unintentionally.md)

Critical Node, High-Risk Path
        * **Attack Vector:** Developers inadvertently observing key paths that expose sensitive data or internal application state that should not be accessible. This is a critical node and high-risk path because it directly leads to information disclosure, a high-impact vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Observe key paths that expose sensitive data or internal application state](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_observe_key_paths_that_expose_sensitive_data_or_internal_application_state.md)

Critical Node, High-Risk Path
            * **Attack Vector:** The specific coding error of selecting key paths that point to sensitive data. This is a critical node and high-risk path as it's the direct cause of unintentional sensitive data observation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit: Trigger KVO notifications on sensitive key paths and intercept/log the observed values.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_trigger_kvo_notifications_on_sensitive_key_paths_and_interceptlog_the_observed_values.md)

Critical Node, High-Risk Path
                * **Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers KVO notifications on the unintentionally observed sensitive key paths. By intercepting logs, network traffic, or other outputs where the observer block might expose the observed values, the attacker gains access to sensitive information. This is a critical node and high-risk path because it directly exploits the information disclosure vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Vulnerabilities in Observer Block/Closure Logic](./attack_tree_paths/3__vulnerabilities_in_observer_blockclosure_logic.md)

High-Risk Path
    * **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities arising from poorly written or insecure logic within the observer blocks/closures that are executed when KVO notifications occur. This is a high-risk path because observer block logic is application-specific and prone to errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Information Disclosure in Observer Blocks](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_information_disclosure_in_observer_blocks.md)

Critical Node, High-Risk Path
        * **Attack Vector:** Observer blocks unintentionally logging, transmitting, or otherwise exposing sensitive data that they observe via KVO. This is a critical node and high-risk path because it directly leads to information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Observer block logs or transmits sensitive data observed via KVO](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_observer_block_logs_or_transmits_sensitive_data_observed_via_kvo.md)

Critical Node, High-Risk Path
            * **Attack Vector:** The specific coding error of including sensitive data handling (like logging or network transmission) within the observer block. This is a critical node and high-risk path as it's the direct cause of information disclosure from observer blocks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit: Trigger KVO notifications and intercept logs or network traffic to capture sensitive data.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_trigger_kvo_notifications_and_intercept_logs_or_network_traffic_to_capture_sensitive_data.md)

Critical Node, High-Risk Path
                * **Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers KVO notifications, causing the vulnerable observer block to execute and potentially log or transmit sensitive data. By intercepting these outputs, the attacker gains access to sensitive information. This is a critical node and high-risk path because it exploits the information disclosure vulnerability in the observer block logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Logic Bugs in Observer Blocks leading to unintended actions](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_logic_bugs_in_observer_blocks_leading_to_unintended_actions.md)

High-Risk Path
        * **Attack Vector:** Flawed logic within observer blocks that can be triggered by manipulating the observed values, leading to unintended application behavior. This is a high-risk path because logic bugs are common and can lead to various security issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Observer block contains flawed logic that can be triggered by manipulating observed values](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_observer_block_contains_flawed_logic_that_can_be_triggered_by_manipulating_observed_values.md)

High-Risk Path
            * **Attack Vector:** The specific coding error of having exploitable logic flaws within the observer block. This is a high-risk path as it's the direct cause of logic-based vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit: Manipulate observed properties to trigger logic flaws in observer blocks, leading to unintended application behavior (e.g., bypassing checks, triggering actions).](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_manipulate_observed_properties_to_trigger_logic_flaws_in_observer_blocks__leading_to_uninten_13153b4e.md)

High-Risk Path
                * **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates the properties being observed by KVO in a way that triggers the logic flaws within the observer block. This can lead to bypassing security checks, triggering unauthorized actions, or manipulating application state in a harmful way. This is a high-risk path because it exploits logic vulnerabilities to achieve application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Denial of Service via Observer Block](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_denial_of_service_via_observer_block.md)

High-Risk Path
        * **Attack Vector:** Observer blocks performing computationally expensive or blocking operations, leading to potential denial of service if notifications are triggered frequently. This is a high-risk path because DoS vulnerabilities are relatively easy to trigger.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1 Observer block performs computationally expensive or blocking operations](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1_observer_block_performs_computationally_expensive_or_blocking_operations.md)

High-Risk Path
            * **Attack Vector:** The specific coding error of including heavy operations within the observer block. This is a high-risk path as it's the direct cause of potential DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit: Repeatedly trigger KVO notifications to overload the application with observer block executions, leading to DoS.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_repeatedly_trigger_kvo_notifications_to_overload_the_application_with_observer_block_executi_34167aed.md)

High-Risk Path
                * **Attack Vector:** An attacker repeatedly triggers KVO notifications, causing the computationally expensive observer block to execute many times, overloading the application and leading to denial of service. This is a high-risk path because it's relatively easy to trigger frequent notifications and cause DoS if the observer block is poorly designed.
