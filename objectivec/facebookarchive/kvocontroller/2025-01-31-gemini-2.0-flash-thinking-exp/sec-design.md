# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `kvocontroller`, is an archived open-source library from Facebook, designed to simplify Key-Value Observing (KVO) in iOS development.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: To provide a reusable and efficient solution for managing KVO in iOS applications.
  - Priority: Enhance developer productivity and code maintainability by abstracting away the complexities of manual KVO implementation in iOS projects. This aims to reduce development time and potential errors associated with manual KVO management.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Risk of Code Defects: As an archived project, active maintenance and bug fixes are unlikely. Potential defects in the library could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in applications that depend on it, negatively impacting user experience.
  - Risk of Security Vulnerabilities: Although less likely for a UI utility library, vulnerabilities could exist. Lack of active maintenance means any discovered security issues might not be addressed, posing a risk to applications using the library.
  - Risk of Compatibility Issues:  The library might not be compatible with newer versions of iOS or Xcode, potentially requiring significant rework or abandonment of the library in future projects.
  - Risk of Dependency on Unmaintained Code: Relying on an archived library introduces a long-term dependency risk. If issues arise or new features are needed, the development team will need to address them internally, increasing maintenance burden.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Standard iOS development practices are assumed to be followed by developers using the library, including memory management and secure coding principles. (Implemented: Developer Responsibility)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk:  As an archived open-source project, there is no guarantee of ongoing security maintenance or timely patching of vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk:  Security vulnerabilities within the library might exist and remain unaddressed due to lack of active development.
  - accepted risk:  Applications integrating this library are responsible for their own overall security posture, including how they utilize KVO and handle data.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Static Code Analysis: Implement static code analysis tools to scan the library code for potential vulnerabilities before integrating it into a project.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning: Although this library likely has minimal dependencies, ensure any dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Code Review: Conduct a thorough code review of the library before integration to understand its functionality and identify potential security concerns.
  - security control: Security Testing: Perform basic security testing, including unit and integration tests focusing on edge cases and potential error conditions, to ensure the library behaves as expected and doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI utility library like `kvocontroller`. Authentication is handled at the application level.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to `kvocontroller`. Authorization is handled at the application level based on application logic and user roles.
  - Input Validation:  If `kvocontroller` takes any input from the application (e.g., property names, observer objects), ensure proper validation to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.  This should be validated within the library itself.
  - Cryptography:  Not directly applicable to `kvocontroller`. Cryptographic operations are handled at the application level if needed. However, ensure the library itself does not inadvertently introduce weaknesses if it interacts with data that might be cryptographically protected at the application level.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - iOS Application Functionality: The primary critical business process is the correct and reliable functioning of iOS applications that utilize KVO for managing data and UI updates. If `kvocontroller` introduces bugs or vulnerabilities, it could disrupt application functionality and user experience.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Application Data: The data being protected is the data handled by the iOS applications that use `kvocontroller`. The sensitivity of this data varies greatly depending on the specific application. It could range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
  - Library Code: The source code of the `kvocontroller` itself is also data to protect, primarily for integrity and availability. However, as it's open source, confidentiality is not a primary concern.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: The primary business goal for using `kvocontroller` is to improve developer efficiency and code maintainability in iOS projects.
  - Question: Are there specific performance requirements or scalability needs for KVO management in the target applications?

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: The applications using `kvocontroller` will handle their own application-level security concerns, and `kvocontroller` is expected to be a secure and reliable component.
  - Question: Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS) that the applications using `kvocontroller` must adhere to? This would influence the required security controls.

- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: `kvocontroller` is used as a static library integrated directly into iOS applications.
  - Question: Are there any plans to modify or extend the `kvocontroller` library? If so, this would necessitate a more detailed security review and potentially changes to the build process.
  - Question: Are there any specific integration points with other libraries or systems that could introduce security considerations? (Assuming minimal external dependencies for a UI utility library).
