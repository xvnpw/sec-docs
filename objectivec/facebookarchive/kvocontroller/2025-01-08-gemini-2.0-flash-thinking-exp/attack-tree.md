## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via kvocontroller Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_kvocontroller_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Success signifies a significant security breach.
*   **Description:** The attacker successfully leverages vulnerabilities related to the `kvocontroller` library to gain unauthorized access or control over the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerabilities exploited.
*   **Impact:**  Complete application compromise, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other severe consequences.
*   **Effort:** Can range from low to high depending on the complexity of the exploit.
*   **Skill Level:** Can range from basic to expert depending on the exploit.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Can be challenging if the attacker is subtle.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate Observed Object's Properties](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_observed_object's_properties.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker focuses on altering the data being monitored by `kvocontroller`.
*   **Description:** By successfully manipulating the properties of objects being observed, the attacker can trigger unintended behavior in observer objects, leading to application compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High.
*   **Effort:** Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Direct Modification of Observed Property](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__direct_modification_of_observed_property.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Directly changing the value of a property being observed.
*   **Description:** The attacker finds a way to directly modify the value of a property that `kvocontroller` is monitoring. This bypasses intended application logic and can directly influence the behavior of observers.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High.
*   **Effort:** Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerability in Code Setting Observed Property [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerability_in_code_setting_observed_property__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the code that sets the observed property's value.
*   **Description:** The attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities like injection flaws or logic errors in the code responsible for setting the values of properties being observed by `kvocontroller`.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High.
*   **Effort:** Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate Observer Object or its Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_observer_object_or_its_behavior.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting the objects that receive KVO notifications.
*   **Description:** The attacker aims to manipulate the observer objects or their internal state to influence how they react to KVO notifications, potentially leading to malicious actions.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium.
*   **Impact:** High.
*   **Effort:** Medium to High.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Replace Observer Object](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__replace_observer_object.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Substituting a legitimate observer with a malicious one.
*   **Description:** The attacker successfully replaces a legitimate observer object with a malicious one under their control. This allows them to intercept KVO notifications and execute arbitrary code or manipulate application logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Low.
*   **Impact:** High.
*   **Effort:** High.
*   **Skill Level:** High.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerability Allowing Observer Replacement [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerability_allowing_observer_replacement__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses that allow for observer replacement.
*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's object management or dependency injection mechanisms to replace legitimate observer objects with malicious ones.
*   **Likelihood:** Low.
*   **Impact:** High.
*   **Effort:** High.
*   **Skill Level:** High.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerability in kvocontroller Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vulnerability_in_kvocontroller_library_itself.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities within the `kvocontroller` library code.
*   **Description:** The attacker discovers and exploits a security vulnerability directly within the `kvocontroller` library's code (e.g., memory corruption, logic errors). While the library is archived, such vulnerabilities might still exist.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low.
*   **Impact:** High.
*   **Effort:** High.
*   **Skill Level:** High.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
