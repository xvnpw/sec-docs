## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Key-Path Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_key-path_manipulation.md)

*Description:* Attackers influence the key paths used for observation, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
*KVOController Contribution:* KVOController simplifies KVO setup but doesn't inherently validate key paths. It relies on the developer to provide correct and safe key paths.
*Example:* An attacker injects a malicious key path string (e.g., `"../../privateData"`) through a vulnerable text field that is used to dynamically construct the observed key path.
*Impact:* Application crash (`NSUnknownKeyException`), unexpected behavior, potential access to unintended data (if the key path somehow resolves to a valid but unauthorized object/property).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* input that contributes to key path construction.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only known-good key paths.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Key Paths:** Minimize the use of dynamically generated key paths, especially those based on user input or external data.  Prefer static key paths whenever possible.
    *   **Sanitization:** If dynamic key paths are unavoidable, sanitize the input thoroughly to remove any potentially malicious characters or sequences.
    *   **Code Review:** Regularly review code that handles key path creation and observation setup to ensure proper validation and sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Observer Removal (Memory Issues/Crashes)](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_observer_removal__memory_issuescrashes_.md)

*Description:* Observers are not properly removed when they are no longer needed, leading to crashes or memory leaks.
*KVOController Contribution:* KVOController *attempts* to simplify observer removal (especially with automatic removal on object deallocation), but incorrect usage can still lead to problems.
*Example:* An object registers an observer using KVOController but fails to explicitly remove the observer before the object is deallocated.  A subsequent notification attempt to the deallocated observer causes a crash.
*Impact:* Application crash (accessing deallocated memory), memory leaks, unexpected behavior.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Leverage Automatic Removal:** Utilize KVOController's features for automatic observer removal whenever possible (e.g., by observing an object and relying on its deallocation to trigger removal).
    *   **Explicit Removal:** If automatic removal is not suitable, explicitly remove observers in the `dealloc` method of the observing object or at another appropriate point in the object's lifecycle.
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review object lifecycle management and observer registration/removal code to ensure proper cleanup.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test object creation and destruction scenarios to catch any potential observer-related issues.

## Attack Surface: [Concurrency Issues (Data Corruption/Crashes)](./attack_surfaces/concurrency_issues__data_corruptioncrashes_.md)

*Description:* Race conditions and data corruption occur due to unsynchronized access to observed properties from multiple threads.
*KVOController Contribution:* KVOController doesn't inherently address concurrency issues.  KVO notifications are typically delivered on the same thread that modified the property.
*Example:* A property observed via KVOController is modified from a background thread, while the observer callback (which accesses the same property) is executed on the main thread.  Without proper synchronization, this can lead to a race condition.
*Impact:* Data corruption, application crashes, unpredictable behavior.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Thread Safety:** Ensure that observer callbacks are thread-safe.  Avoid accessing or modifying shared resources without proper synchronization.
    *   **Synchronization Primitives:** Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes, dispatch queues) to protect access to shared data from multiple threads.
    *   **Dispatch Queues:** Utilize Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to ensure that observer callbacks are executed on a specific queue (e.g., the main queue for UI updates).  KVOController allows specifying the dispatch queue for notifications.
    *   **Immutability:** If possible, make the observed properties immutable or use immutable copies within the observer callback to avoid concurrency issues.

## Attack Surface: [Archived Project Risks (Unpatched Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/archived_project_risks__unpatched_vulnerabilities_.md)

*Description:* The KVOController library is archived and no longer maintained, meaning any security vulnerabilities will remain unpatched.
*KVOController Contribution:* This is an inherent risk of using *any* archived project. The project being KVOController is the direct involvement.
*Example:* A zero-day vulnerability is discovered in KVOController's internal implementation that allows for arbitrary code execution.  Since the project is archived, no patch will be released.
*Impact:* Potential for arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other severe security compromises, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Migration (Primary):** Migrate to a supported alternative (Combine, ReactiveSwift/ReactiveCocoa, or Swift's built-in KVO) as soon as possible. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Fork and Patch (Temporary):** If migration is not immediately feasible, consider forking the KVOController repository and applying any necessary security patches yourself.  This is a temporary solution and requires significant expertise.
    *   **Code Audit:** Conduct a thorough security audit of the KVOController codebase and its dependencies to identify and potentially mitigate any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limited Usage:** If migration is impossible and forking is not an option, severely restrict the use of KVOController to non-critical parts of the application and apply all other mitigations rigorously.
