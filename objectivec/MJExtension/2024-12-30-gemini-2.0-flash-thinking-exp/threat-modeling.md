### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving MJExtension

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve the MJExtension library.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Malicious Payloads
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload and provides it to the application, which uses MJExtension to deserialize it into Objective-C objects. The attacker manipulates the JSON structure or content to trigger vulnerabilities *within MJExtension's deserialization logic itself*, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even code execution within the context of the application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application crashes or instability due to errors within MJExtension's deserialization process.
        *   Potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in MJExtension's deserialization logic that can be triggered by crafted payloads.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core Deserialization Logic (within MJExtension)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update MJExtension to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   While input validation at the application level is important, focus on ensuring MJExtension is up-to-date to mitigate inherent risks within the library.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Transformation Blocks
    *   **Description:** If the application uses MJExtension's custom transformation blocks, and vulnerabilities exist *within MJExtension's handling or execution of these blocks*, an attacker might craft input that exploits these vulnerabilities. This is specifically about flaws in how MJExtension manages and executes these custom blocks, not just flaws in the block's logic itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potential for arbitrary code execution if MJExtension's handling of custom blocks allows for it.
        *   Unexpected behavior or crashes due to errors in MJExtension's block execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Transformation Blocks Feature (within MJExtension)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep MJExtension updated to patch any vulnerabilities related to custom block handling.
        *   While reviewing the custom block logic is crucial, also consider if MJExtension itself has any known issues related to block execution.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Potential Vulnerabilities within MJExtension Library Itself
    *   **Description:** MJExtension, like any software, might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities in its core code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing specific malicious JSON payloads or triggering certain code paths *within MJExtension*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Range of impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure stemming directly from a flaw in MJExtension.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components within the MJExtension library code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with the latest version of MJExtension to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with MJExtension.
