*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Content Injection via Data Source
    *   **Description:** The application populates the `iCarousel` with data (images, views, etc.) fetched from potentially untrusted sources without proper sanitization.
    *   **How iCarousel Contributes:** `iCarousel` is designed to display the content provided to it through its data source. It renders the views or data models without inherently validating their safety.
    *   **Example:** An application fetches image URLs from a remote server and uses them to populate the `iCarousel`. A malicious actor could compromise the server and inject URLs pointing to malicious JavaScript or phishing pages disguised as images. When the `iCarousel` attempts to load these "images" (potentially in a web view or through a custom rendering process), the malicious script could execute or the user could be redirected to a phishing site.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)-like attacks within the application context, UI redressing/clickjacking by overlaying malicious content, denial of service by injecting excessively large or complex data that crashes the carousel or the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the type of content displayed and the application's handling of it).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data used to populate the `iCarousel`'s data source before passing it to the library. This includes validating URLs, ensuring image data is legitimate, and escaping any potentially harmful characters if displaying text-based content.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the `iCarousel` displays web content, implement a strict Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which the content can be loaded and the types of actions that can be performed.
        *   **Secure Content Loading:** Ensure that content is loaded securely (e.g., using HTTPS for images and other resources).
