# Attack Surface Analysis for slackhq/slacktextviewcontroller

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Text Input Leading to ReDoS](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_text_input_leading_to_redos.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts specific input strings that exploit the regular expressions used *within `slacktextviewcontroller`* for parsing mentions, hashtags, or other custom entities, causing excessive CPU consumption and potentially leading to denial of service.
* **How slacktextviewcontroller Contributes:** The library's internal parsing logic, specifically the regular expressions it employs to identify and process special text elements, is the direct source of this vulnerability. Inefficient or vulnerable regex patterns within the library are the core issue.
* **Example:** An attacker inputs a long string with a repeating pattern specifically designed to make the library's regex engine backtrack excessively while trying to match a mention or hashtag.
* **Impact:** Application slowdown, unresponsiveness, or complete denial of service, impacting all users.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Review and optimize the regular expressions used within `slacktextviewcontroller` (if possible through configuration or forked versions) for efficiency and resilience against ReDoS.
    * Implement timeouts for regex execution within the application's processing of text *originating from* the `slacktextviewcontroller`.
    * Consider alternative parsing methods *within the application* if regex performance related to the library's processing is a concern.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Rendered Mentions/Hashtags](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_rendered_mentionshashtags.md)

* **Description:** If the application renders mentions or hashtags *as identified and potentially formatted by `slacktextviewcontroller`* without proper output encoding, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within a "mention" or "hashtag" that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
* **How slacktextviewcontroller Contributes:** The library identifies and potentially formats mentions and hashtags. If the application directly uses this output *provided by the library* and renders it into the UI without sanitization, it creates the vulnerability. The library's role is in identifying and potentially formatting the potentially malicious strings.
* **Example:** An attacker creates a "mention" like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which, when processed by the library and then rendered by the application, executes the JavaScript alert.
* **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Crucially, the application developers must implement proper output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) when rendering any text content, including mentions and hashtags *that were identified by `slacktextviewcontroller`*.**
    * If possible, configure `slacktextviewcontroller` to provide plain text versions of mentions and hashtags, and handle the rendering and linking securely within the application.
    * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.
