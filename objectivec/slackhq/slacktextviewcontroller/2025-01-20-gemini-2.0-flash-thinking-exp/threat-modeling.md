# Threat Model Analysis for slackhq/slacktextviewcontroller

## Threat: [Malicious Input Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_input_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts specific input strings containing unusual characters, excessively long sequences, or deeply nested formatting that, when processed by `slacktextviewcontroller`, consumes excessive CPU or memory resources *within the library itself*. This can lead to the application component using the text view becoming unresponsive or crashing.
    - **Impact:** The part of the application utilizing the `slacktextviewcontroller` becomes unavailable or severely degraded, impacting user experience.
    - **Affected Component:** Text parsing and rendering logic within `slacktextviewcontroller`.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement input length limits *before* passing data to `slacktextviewcontroller`.
        - Consider if the library offers configuration options to limit processing complexity.
        - Monitor resource usage of the application component using the library.
        - Update to the latest version of `slacktextviewcontroller` as fixes for such issues are released.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Formatting](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_formatting.md)

- **Description:** An attacker injects malicious formatting or special characters that, when rendered by `slacktextviewcontroller`, allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code *when the library's output is displayed*. This indicates a flaw in the library's rendering or escaping of potentially harmful content.
    - **Impact:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on behalf of the user within the context where the `slacktextviewcontroller` output is displayed.
    - **Affected Component:** Text rendering engine within `slacktextviewcontroller`.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure the application properly encodes or sanitizes the output *received from* `slacktextviewcontroller` before displaying it. While the flaw is in the library, defense-in-depth is crucial.
        - Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS.
        - Regularly update `slacktextviewcontroller` to benefit from security patches addressing rendering vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through Rendering Bugs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_rendering_bugs.md)

- **Description:** A bug in the rendering logic of `slacktextviewcontroller` could potentially lead to the unintended display of sensitive information *handled or processed by the library* that should not be visible to the user. This would indicate a flaw in how the library manages or renders data.
    - **Impact:** Confidential information leakage to the user interface.
    - **Affected Component:** Text rendering engine within `slacktextviewcontroller`.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update `slacktextviewcontroller` to benefit from bug fixes.
        - Conduct thorough testing, including edge cases and unusual input, to identify potential rendering issues.
        - Avoid passing sensitive data directly to the text view if possible; instead, use placeholders or indirect references *before* the library processes it.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Pasted Content](./threats/insecure_handling_of_pasted_content.md)

- **Description:** When users paste content, `slacktextviewcontroller` might not properly sanitize or handle the pasted data *internally*, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities within the library's processing. This could include issues with handling rich text formats, embedded objects, or control characters that the library doesn't adequately manage.
    - **Impact:** Can lead to XSS (if the library renders malicious pasted content), DoS (if processing pasted content consumes excessive resources within the library), or other unexpected behavior directly caused by the library's handling of the paste operation.
    - **Affected Component:** Input processing logic, specifically handling of pasted content within `slacktextviewcontroller`.
    - **Risk Severity:** High (If it leads to XSS or significant DoS).
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - If possible, configure `slacktextviewcontroller` to handle only plain text pasting or to sanitize pasted content aggressively.
        - Update to the latest version of the library, as paste handling vulnerabilities are often addressed in updates.
