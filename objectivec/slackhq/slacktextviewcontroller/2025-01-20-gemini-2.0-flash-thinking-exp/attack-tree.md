## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Mention/Hashtag Injection -> Inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payload](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_mentionhashtag_injection_-_inject_cross-site_scripting__xss__payload.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a mention or hashtag within the `slacktextviewcontroller` input field that contains malicious JavaScript code.

**Mechanism:** When the application renders the content containing this crafted mention or hashtag, it fails to properly sanitize or encode the output. This allows the embedded JavaScript code to be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Successful execution of the XSS payload can lead to:

*   Session hijacking (stealing session cookies).
*   Account takeover.
*   Defacement of the application.
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Theft of sensitive information.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application fails to sanitize output when rendering mentions/hashtags](./attack_tree_paths/application_fails_to_sanitize_output_when_rendering_mentionshashtags.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a vulnerability in the application's rendering logic.

**Mechanism:** The application directly outputs the content processed by `slacktextviewcontroller` (including mentions and hashtags) into the HTML without proper encoding or escaping of characters that have special meaning in HTML (e.g., `<`, `>`, `
