# Threat Model Analysis for slackhq/slacktextviewcontroller

## Threat: [Input Manipulation via Custom Attachments](./threats/input_manipulation_via_custom_attachments.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious attachment (e.g., a specially formatted image or file) that exploits a vulnerability in the `SLKTextViewController`'s attachment handling logic.  This could lead to code execution, denial of service, or data corruption. The attacker might also try to inject malicious data through custom attachment previews.  This is *direct* because it targets the specific attachment processing mechanisms within STVC.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, arbitrary code execution (in severe cases), data corruption, denial of service. Could compromise the entire application and potentially the device.
*   **Affected Component:** `SLKTextViewController`'s attachment handling, including `SLKAttachment` objects, custom `NSTextAttachment` subclasses, and the `textView:shouldInteractWithAttachment:inRange:interaction:` delegate method. Custom attachment preview views are also at risk.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible) / High (if denial of service or data corruption is possible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate *all* attachment data *before* processing it. Check file types, sizes, and contents for anomalies, using robust validation routines, not just file extensions.
    *   Use *secure* libraries for handling different attachment types (e.g., image processing, file parsing).  Ensure these libraries are kept up-to-date.
    *   *Avoid* executing code from attachments directly.  If absolutely necessary, use extreme caution and strong sandboxing.
    *   Implement sandboxing or other isolation techniques to limit the impact of a compromised attachment, preventing it from accessing other parts of the application or system.
    *   Sanitize and validate data displayed in custom attachment previews.  Assume preview data is potentially malicious.
    *   Regularly update dependencies and libraries used for attachment handling, patching any known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via Autocomplete Suggestions](./threats/data_leakage_via_autocomplete_suggestions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could analyze network traffic or application memory to glean sensitive information displayed in *custom* autocomplete suggestions. If the autocomplete logic pulls data from an insecure source (e.g., a local cache that's not properly encrypted, or a backend API without proper authorization), the attacker could retrieve this data. The attacker might also try to manipulate the autocomplete data source to inject malicious suggestions. This is *direct* because it targets STVC's custom autocomplete features.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data (e.g., previously entered messages, contact information, API keys if improperly handled). Could lead to identity theft, financial loss, or unauthorized access to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** `SLKTextViewController`'s autocomplete functionality, specifically custom implementations of `textView:completionForPrefix:range:`. The `SLKAutoCompletionView` and any custom data sources used for autocomplete suggestions are also affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is involved).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure autocomplete data sources are *secure*. Use encrypted storage for local caches and implement proper authentication/authorization for backend APIs.
    *   *Avoid* storing sensitive data in autocomplete suggestions. If unavoidable, use strong encryption and consider short-lived caches.
    *   Validate and sanitize data retrieved from autocomplete data sources *before* displaying it.
    *   Limit the scope of data exposed in autocomplete suggestions (e.g., only show relevant snippets, not entire messages).
    *   Implement rate limiting on autocomplete requests to prevent attackers from rapidly querying the data source.

## Threat: [Pasteboard Data Exposure](./threats/pasteboard_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the device (especially a jailbroken device) could monitor the pasteboard for sensitive data copied *into* the `SLKTextViewController`. If the application doesn't clear the pasteboard after processing the input, the data remains accessible to other applications. This is *direct* because it involves STVC's interaction with the system pasteboard.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data copied into the text view (e.g., passwords, API keys, confidential messages). Could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected Component:** The `SLKTextView` component and its interaction with the system pasteboard (`UIPasteboard`). The `canPaste:` method and any custom paste handling logic are relevant.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is handled).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Programmatically clear the pasteboard (`UIPasteboard.general.string = ""`) *after* the input is processed (e.g., after the message is sent). This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   Consider disabling copy/paste functionality entirely for `SLKTextView` instances that handle highly sensitive data. Use `textView.editable = NO` or override `canPerformAction:withSender:` to prevent pasting.  This is a strong, but potentially user-unfriendly, mitigation.
    *   Educate users about the risks of pasting sensitive information.
    *   Use the `UIPasteboardDetectionPattern` (iOS 14+) to detect and warn users about potentially sensitive content on the pasteboard.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Text Attributes](./threats/improper_handling_of_text_attributes.md)

* **Description:** If custom text attributes (e.g., for styling, mentions, or custom links) are not handled correctly within the `SLKTextView`, an attacker might be able to inject malicious data or cause unexpected behavior.  A poorly handled URL scheme, *specifically within the context of STVC's text rendering*, could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. This is *direct* because it targets how STVC processes and displays attributed strings.
    * **Impact:**  Potential for code execution (if URL schemes are mishandled), application crashes, or unexpected UI behavior.
    * **Affected Component:** `SLKTextView` and its handling of `NSAttributedString` and custom `NSTextAttachment` subclasses. The `textView:shouldInteractWithURL:inRange:interaction:` delegate method is particularly relevant.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if code execution is possible).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate *all* URLs and other custom attributes *before* processing them within the `SLKTextView`.
        *   Use a *whitelist* of allowed URL schemes, strictly enforcing this list.
        *   *Avoid* executing code based on user-provided attributes without proper sanitization and validation.  Assume all attributes are potentially malicious.
        *   Use the system-provided URL handling mechanisms whenever possible, and ensure they are used securely.
