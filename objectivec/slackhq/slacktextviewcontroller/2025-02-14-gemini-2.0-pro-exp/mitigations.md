## Mitigation Strategy: [STVC-Specific Configuration and Feature Disabling](./mitigation_strategies/stvc-specific_configuration_and_feature_disabling.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy:  STVC-Specific Configuration and Feature Disabling**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Review Documentation:** Thoroughly review the `SlackTextViewController` documentation (API reference, configuration options, and any available security guides).
        2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Identify and disable any STVC features that are *not essential* to your application's functionality.  This includes:
            *   `autoCompletes:`  If you don't *need* auto-completion for usernames, channels, or emojis, disable it.  If you *do* need it, consider limiting the scope (e.g., only auto-complete users in the current channel).
            *   `textView.shouldEnableTypingSuggestion:` If you don't need typing suggestions, disable.
            *   `allowsPaste:` Consider if pasting rich text is truly necessary. If not, disable it to reduce the attack surface.
            *   `allowsAttachments:` If your application doesn't support attachments, disable this feature.
            *   Any other optional features related to formatting, linking, etc.
        3.  **Configure Text Input Restrictions:**
            *   `textView.textLimit:` Set a reasonable maximum character limit *directly within STVC*. This provides a client-side check (though server-side enforcement is still crucial).
            *   Explore any other STVC configuration options that allow you to restrict the type or format of input.
        4.  **Event Handling:** Carefully review the event handlers provided by STVC (e.g., `didChangeText`, `didPressLeftButton`, `didPressRightButton`).  Ensure that *your* code within these handlers does not introduce vulnerabilities.  For example, if you're doing any custom processing of the text within `didChangeText`, make sure that processing is secure.
        5.  **Custom Renderers (If Applicable):** If you are using custom renderers to display the STVC output, ensure those renderers are secure and handle potentially malicious input safely.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - By disabling unnecessary features and restricting input, you reduce the potential for malicious code to be injected and rendered.
        *   **Data Leakage (Enumeration):** (Severity: Low) - Disabling auto-completion reduces the risk of attackers enumerating users or channels.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Limiting text length helps prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
        *   **Phishing (via Mentions):** (Severity: Medium) - Disabling or restricting auto-completion reduces the attack surface for phishing.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: Moderate (reduces the attack surface, but independent sanitization is still essential).
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduction: Moderate (disabling auto-completion is a significant step).
        *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: Low (client-side limits are a first line of defense, but server-side limits are crucial).
        *   **Phishing:** Risk reduction: Moderate.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Example: Partially implemented. `textView.textLimit` is set, but other features (like auto-completion) are enabled without restriction.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A comprehensive review of all STVC configuration options and feature flags needs to be conducted.
        *   Unnecessary features need to be explicitly disabled.
        *   The scope of auto-completion (if used) needs to be restricted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side Input Pre-processing (Before STVC)](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_input_pre-processing__before_stvc_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:  Client-Side Input Pre-processing (Before STVC)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Interception:** Before any text is passed to `SlackTextViewController`, intercept it. This might be in a text field delegate method, an `onChange` handler, or wherever user input is first received.
        2.  **Basic Sanitization (Lightweight):** Perform a *lightweight*, preliminary sanitization *before* passing the text to STVC. This is *not* a replacement for a full sanitization library (as described in previous responses), but rather a quick, client-side check to remove obviously dangerous characters or patterns.  Examples:
            *   Remove or escape known dangerous characters like `<`, `>`, `&` (if not already handled by STVC).
            *   Reject input that contains obvious script tags (e.g., `<script>`).
            *   Implement a very basic regular expression whitelist to allow only a limited set of characters (if appropriate for your use case).
        3.  **Pass to STVC:** After this pre-processing, pass the (potentially modified) text to `SlackTextViewController`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Provides an *additional* layer of defense against XSS, catching simple attacks before they reach STVC.
        *   **HTML/Markdown Injection:** (Severity: Medium) - Similar to XSS, helps prevent basic injection attacks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: Low (this is a *supplementary* measure, not a primary defense).
        *   **HTML/Markdown Injection:** Risk reduction: Low (supplementary).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented. Input is passed directly to STVC without any pre-processing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The interception and lightweight sanitization logic needs to be implemented before any text is sent to STVC.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of STVC Output](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_stvc_output.md)

* **3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Handling of STVC Output**
    * **Description:**
        1.  **Retrieve Output Safely:** When retrieving the formatted text or attributed string from STVC, use the appropriate methods provided by the library (e.g., `textView.attributedText`, `textView.text`).
        2.  **Avoid Direct Use in Risky Contexts:** *Never* directly insert the raw output from STVC into a context where it could be interpreted as code (e.g., a `WKWebView` without proper sanitization, or directly into a database query).
        3.  **Output Encoding:** If you are displaying the STVC output in a UI element (e.g., a label, another text view), ensure that proper output encoding is applied. This helps prevent misinterpretation of characters.
        4. **Contextual Rendering:** If the output is displayed in different contexts (e.g., a preview vs. a full message view), ensure that the rendering is appropriate for each context. For example, a preview might have stricter limits on formatting.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Prevents vulnerabilities if the STVC output is displayed in a web view or other context where code could be executed.
        *   **HTML/Markdown Injection:** (Severity: Medium) - Ensures that the output is treated as data, not code.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: High (if the output is displayed in a web view or similar context).
        *   **HTML/Markdown Injection:** Risk reduction: Medium.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Output encoding is used when displaying the text in a `UILabel`, but not in all contexts.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The code that displays STVC output in a custom preview view needs to be reviewed to ensure proper output encoding and handling.
        *   Any use of STVC output in a web view needs *thorough* review and likely requires additional sanitization.
