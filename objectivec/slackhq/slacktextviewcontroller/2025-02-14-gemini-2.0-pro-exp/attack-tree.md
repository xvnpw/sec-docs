## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Validation/Sanitization Bypass [!] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_validationsanitization_bypass__!___critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overarching category for attacks that exploit weaknesses in how the application (or, less likely, the library) handles user-provided input.  It's the foundation for many other attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Failure to properly escape or sanitize user input before displaying it or using it in other operations.
    *   Insufficient input validation, allowing unexpected characters or data formats.
    *   Vulnerabilities in the library's internal text processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 XSS/Injection [!] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_xssinjection__!___critical_node_.md)

*   This attack aims to inject malicious scripts (typically JavaScript) into the application, which are then executed in the context of other users' browsers or the application itself.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Injecting `<script>` tags with malicious code.
        *   Using event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) to execute JavaScript.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles URLs or other data that can be used to inject scripts.
        *   Bypassing character escaping mechanisms using techniques like double encoding or Unicode encoding.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Bypass escaping mechanisms [!] (Critical Node) ---> (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_bypass_escaping_mechanisms__!___critical_node__---__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This is the specific step of crafting input that circumvents any attempts by the application or library to neutralize potentially harmful characters or code.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Using unusual Unicode characters that are not properly handled.
        *   Double encoding characters (e.g., `%253C` for `<`).
        *   Exploiting specific parsing logic within the library's text rendering.
        *   Finding edge cases or vulnerabilities in the escaping functions used by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Data Leakage (via Unintended Autocompletion/Suggestions) [!] (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_data_leakage__via_unintended_autocompletionsuggestions___!___critical_node_.md)

*   This attack focuses on extracting sensitive information through the autocompletion feature.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Providing carefully crafted input that triggers the display of previously entered data, usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the autocompletion logic to reveal data that should not be suggested.
        *   Manipulating the autocompletion data source to include sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Trigger unintended autocompletion by suggesting sensitive data](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_trigger_unintended_autocompletion_by_suggesting_sensitive_data.md)

*   This is the specific action of causing the autocompletion feature to display sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Typing partial usernames or email addresses to trigger suggestions.
        *   Entering specific characters or patterns known to trigger the display of sensitive data.
        *   Exploiting timing or race conditions in the autocompletion logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Autocomplete Manipulation [!]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_autocomplete_manipulation__!_.md)

* This attack focuses on manipulating the autocompletion feature to either leak data or trick the user.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Injecting malicious suggestions into the autocomplete data.
        * Triggering the display of malicious suggestions.
        * Bypassing any filtering of autocomplete suggestions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Poison autocomplete data ---> (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_poison_autocomplete_data_---__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This involves injecting malicious suggestions into the data source used by the autocompletion feature.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application that allow modification of the autocomplete data.
        *   If the autocomplete data is stored client-side, manipulating it directly.
        *   If the autocomplete data is user-specific, poisoning one user's data to affect others (if suggestions are shared).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 Trigger unintended autocompletion with malicious suggestions](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_trigger_unintended_autocompletion_with_malicious_suggestions.md)

*   This is the step of causing the application to display the attacker's poisoned autocomplete suggestions to the user.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Crafting input that matches the attacker's malicious suggestions.
        *   Exploiting timing or race conditions to ensure the malicious suggestions are displayed.
        *   Manipulating the user interface to make the malicious suggestions more prominent.
