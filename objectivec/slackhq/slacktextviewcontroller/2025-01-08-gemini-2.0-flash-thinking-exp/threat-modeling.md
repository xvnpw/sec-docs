# Threat Model Analysis for slackhq/slacktextviewcontroller

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Input Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_input_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a message containing malicious HTML or JavaScript code within the text input. When the `slacktextviewcontroller` renders this input, the malicious script executes in the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** User's account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application interface, redirection to malicious websites.

**Affected Component:** The input processing and rendering module of `slacktextviewcontroller`, specifically the part responsible for interpreting and displaying formatted text.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the `slacktextviewcontroller` library itself performs proper output encoding and escaping to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
* Implement robust server-side sanitization of user input *before* it is passed to the `slacktextviewcontroller` as a defense-in-depth measure.
* Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Markdown Injection Leading to Misleading Content or Actions](./threats/markdown_injection_leading_to_misleading_content_or_actions.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious Markdown syntax into the text input. The `slacktextviewcontroller` interprets this Markdown, potentially leading to the rendering of misleading links (phishing), embedding of malicious images, or unexpected formatting that could trick users into performing unintended actions.

**Impact:** Phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, display of misleading information, potential for triggering browser vulnerabilities through malicious embedded content.

**Affected Component:** The Markdown parsing and rendering logic within `slacktextviewcontroller`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review the supported Markdown features of `slacktextviewcontroller` and consider disabling or limiting features that pose a higher risk.
* Sanitize user input on the server-side to remove or neutralize potentially harmful Markdown syntax *before* it is processed by the `slacktextviewcontroller`.
* Implement client-side validation to warn users about potentially risky Markdown usage.
