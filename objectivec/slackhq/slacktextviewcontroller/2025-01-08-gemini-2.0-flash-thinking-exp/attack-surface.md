# Attack Surface Analysis for slackhq/slacktextviewcontroller

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Mention Payloads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_mention_payloads.md)

**Description:** Crafted mention strings (e.g., `@user`) designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities or cause resource exhaustion within the library.

**How `slacktextviewcontroller` Contributes:** The library's parsing logic for identifying mention syntax is the direct point of vulnerability.

**Example:** A user inputs a very long mention string like `@aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`.

**Impact:**
*   Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) leading to application slowdown or crashes directly within the text view handling.
*   Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) if the library repeatedly attempts to parse such payloads.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Length Limits:** Implement strict limits on the maximum length of mention strings the library will attempt to parse.
*   **Parsing Complexity Limits:** Design the parsing logic within the library to gracefully handle complex or excessively long mentions, preventing resource exhaustion within its own operations.
*   **Regular Expression Review (if used):** If the library uses regular expressions for mention parsing, ensure they are not susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Parsing](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_parsing.md)

**Description:** If `slacktextviewcontroller` uses regular expressions for parsing mentions or emojis, poorly written regex patterns can be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks, impacting the library's performance.

**How `slacktextviewcontroller` Contributes:** The vulnerability lies directly within the library's implementation of regular expressions for parsing.

**Example:** A crafted input string that, when processed by the library's regex engine, causes excessive backtracking and a significant increase in processing time within the text view operations.

**Impact:**
*   Severe performance degradation or complete freezing of the text view and potentially the application due to the library's resource consumption.
*   Denial of Service affecting the text input functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Careful Regex Design:** Thoroughly review and test all regular expressions used *within the library* for parsing to ensure they are not susceptible to ReDoS. Use techniques to avoid backtracking issues.
*   **Alternative Parsing Methods:** Consider using alternative parsing techniques *within the library* that are less prone to ReDoS vulnerabilities.
*   **Timeouts for Regex Operations:** Implement timeouts for regex operations *within the library* to prevent them from running indefinitely.
