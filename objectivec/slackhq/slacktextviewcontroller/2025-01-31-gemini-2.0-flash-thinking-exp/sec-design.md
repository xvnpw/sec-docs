# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is an open-source iOS library, `slacktextviewcontroller`, developed and maintained by Slack. The primary business goal for Slack in open-sourcing this component is likely to contribute to the iOS developer community by providing a reusable, high-quality text view controller similar to the one used in their own Slack iOS application. This can enhance the developer experience for iOS developers in general and potentially attract contributions and improvements from the community back to the library. For companies and developers adopting this library, the goal is to accelerate development and improve the user experience of their iOS applications by leveraging a pre-built, feature-rich text input component.

Key business priorities and goals are:

*   Provide a robust and customizable text view controller for iOS applications.
*   Enhance the user experience of iOS applications using this component by offering rich text editing capabilities.
*   Foster community engagement and contributions to improve the library.
*   Reduce development time and effort for developers needing advanced text input features in their iOS apps.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library could be inherited by applications that depend on it, potentially impacting end-users and the reputation of those applications.
*   Lack of ongoing maintenance and security updates could lead to the library becoming outdated and insecure over time.
*   Integration issues with different iOS versions or other libraries could hinder adoption and cause compatibility problems for users.
*   Performance issues within the library could negatively impact the performance of applications using it, leading to poor user experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the `slacktextviewcontroller` project:

*   security control: Open Source Codebase - The code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny, which can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub repository.
*   security control: Version Control - Git history provides traceability of changes and facilitates rollback in case of issues, including security vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub repository.
*   security control: Issue Tracking - GitHub Issues are used to report bugs and feature requests, which can include security-related issues. Implemented: GitHub repository.
*   security control: Code Review - While not explicitly stated, it is assumed that Slack employs internal code review processes for contributions to their open-source projects before merging changes. Implemented: Slack internal development process (assumed).

Accepted risks for the `slacktextviewcontroller` project:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions - As an open-source project, the project relies on the community to report and potentially contribute fixes for security vulnerabilities. The responsiveness to security issues depends on community engagement and maintainer availability.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies - The library may depend on third-party libraries, which could introduce their own vulnerabilities. The security of the `slacktextviewcontroller` is partially dependent on the security of its dependencies.

Recommended security controls to implement:

*   security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
*   security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers and users on how to report security issues responsibly.
*   security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits or penetration testing by security experts to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Signed Releases - Sign releases of the library to ensure authenticity and integrity, protecting against tampering during distribution.

Security requirements for the `slacktextviewcontroller` project:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to a UI library. Authentication is handled by the applications that integrate this library.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to a UI library. Authorization is handled by the applications that integrate this library.
*   Input Validation: While the library primarily handles text display and input, it should be designed to handle potentially malicious or unexpected input gracefully without causing crashes or unexpected behavior. Input validation should be considered in areas where the library processes external data or user input beyond basic text.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of a text view controller library. Cryptographic operations would be handled by the applications that integrate this library if needed for securing data. However, if the library were to handle any sensitive data internally (which is not expected for a UI component like this), appropriate cryptographic measures would be necessary.

```

### Build Process Description

The build process for the `slacktextviewcontroller` library starts with iOS developers committing code changes to the GitHub repository.  It is assumed that a CI system, likely GitHub Actions given it's a GitHub repository, is configured to automatically trigger builds upon code changes (e.g., push to main branch, pull requests).

The CI system performs the following steps:

1.  Checkout Code: Retrieves the latest code from the GitHub repository.
2.  Build & Test: Compiles the iOS library code and runs automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
3.  Security Checks (Recommended): Integrate security checks into the build pipeline. This should include:
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyze the source code for potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Dependency Scanning: Check for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
4.  Create Build Artifacts: Packages the compiled library into distributable artifacts, such as iOS Frameworks or Swift Packages.
5.  Publish Artifacts:  Releases the build artifacts to distribution platforms, such as GitHub Releases and package registries like CocoaPods and Swift Package Registry, making the library available to iOS developers.

Security controls in the build process:

*   security control: Code Repository Access Control - GitHub repository access controls manage who can commit code changes. Implemented: GitHub repository settings.
*   security control: CI/CD Pipeline - Automated build and test process reduces manual errors and ensures consistent builds. Implemented: Assumed GitHub Actions.
*   security control: Automated Testing - Automated tests help ensure code quality and reduce the likelihood of bugs, including security-related bugs. Implemented: Assumed in CI pipeline.
*   security control: SAST and Dependency Scanning (Recommended) - Proactively identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies during the build process. Recommended for CI pipeline.
*   security control: Signed Releases (Recommended) - Signing build artifacts ensures the integrity and authenticity of the distributed library. Recommended for release process.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:

*   The primary critical business process is the secure development and distribution of the `slacktextviewcontroller` library to ensure that applications using it are not exposed to vulnerabilities originating from the library itself. This indirectly protects the reputation of Slack as the library provider and the security of applications that depend on it. For organizations using this library, the critical process is the secure development and operation of their iOS applications, where the library is a component.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

*   The `slacktextviewcontroller` library itself does not directly handle sensitive user data. However, applications that integrate this library will likely handle various types of data, including potentially sensitive text data entered by users (e.g., messages, personal information, documents). The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the context of the consuming application and its purpose. The library should be designed and built in a way that does not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data handled by consuming applications.
