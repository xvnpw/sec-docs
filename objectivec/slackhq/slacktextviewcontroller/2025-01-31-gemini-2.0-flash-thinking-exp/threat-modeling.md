# Threat Model Analysis for slackhq/slacktextviewcontroller

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Mentions or Channel Names](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_mentions_or_channel_names.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input within mentions (e.g., `@<script>...</script>`) or channel names (e.g., `#<img src=... onerror=...>`). When `slacktextviewcontroller` processes this input and the application renders it without proper sanitization, the attacker's JavaScript code executes in the user's context. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Impact:** User account compromise, sensitive data theft, application defacement, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.

**Affected Component:** Output rendering logic of the application that displays text processed by `slacktextviewcontroller`, specifically when handling mentions and channel names.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Robust Output Encoding:**  Always implement strict output encoding (HTML escaping) for user-provided content, especially mentions and channel names, before displaying them in any web views or HTML-based UI components.
*   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement server-side or client-side input validation to restrict the characters allowed in mentions and channel names, preventing the injection of HTML or JavaScript code.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If applicable (e.g., when rendering in web views), utilize a Content Security Policy to further restrict the execution of inline scripts and control resource loading, mitigating XSS impact.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Mention/Channel Parsing](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_mentionchannel_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted input strings to `slacktextviewcontroller` that exploit inefficient regular expressions used for parsing mentions and channel names. These malicious strings cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU resources and processing time due to backtracking, leading to application freeze or unresponsiveness, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, denial of service for users, significant degradation of user experience, potential resource exhaustion on the server or client device.

**Affected Component:** Regular expression engine within `slacktextviewcontroller` responsible for parsing mentions and channel names from user input.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Review and Optimize Regular Expressions:** Analyze the regular expressions used by `slacktextviewcontroller` for parsing mentions and channels. Replace any potentially vulnerable regex patterns with more efficient and ReDoS-resistant alternatives.
*   **Implement Input Length Limits:** Enforce reasonable limits on the length of user input processed by `slacktextviewcontroller` to reduce the attack surface for ReDoS exploits.
*   **Regex Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for regular expression matching operations to prevent indefinite processing and mitigate the impact of ReDoS attacks by limiting the execution time.
*   **Fuzzing and Performance Testing:** Conduct fuzzing and performance testing with long and complex input strings to identify and address potential ReDoS vulnerabilities in the regex parsing logic.
