**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Malicious Input Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Formatting, CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Input Validation):**

*   **Attack Vector: Craft XSS Payload in Markdown (HIGH-RISK LEAF):**
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a message using Markdown syntax that includes malicious JavaScript code. When the application renders this message without proper sanitization, the JavaScript is executed in the victim's browser.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Example:** Including an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` attribute containing JavaScript: `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Client-Side Validation Weaknesses (HIGH-RISK LEAF):**
    *   **Description:** The application relies on client-side JavaScript to validate user input. An attacker can bypass this validation by manipulating the client-side code or by crafting malicious requests directly to the server, sending data that the client-side validation would have blocked.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Injecting malicious data into the application, bypassing security checks, triggering server-side errors or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Using browser developer tools to modify form data before submission or crafting a raw HTTP request with invalid data.

**2. Abuse Media Handling Features (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Upload Malicious Files):**

*   **Attack Vector: Upload File with Malicious Code (e.g., SVG with JavaScript) (HIGH-RISK LEAF):**
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a file that contains malicious code, such as an SVG image with embedded JavaScript. If the application processes or serves this file without proper sanitization or security measures, the malicious code can be executed.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the file is served and rendered in a browser, potential for server-side code execution if the application attempts to process the file in a vulnerable way.
    *   **Example:** Creating an SVG file with `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` embedded within it.
*   **Attack Vector: Trigger XSS through Media Preview (HIGH-RISK LEAF):**
    *   **Description:** The application generates a preview of uploaded media. If the process of generating or displaying this preview is vulnerable, an attacker can upload a specially crafted media file that, when previewed, executes malicious JavaScript in the user's browser.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
    *   **Example:** Uploading a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the image rendering library used for previews.

**3. Exploit Custom Actions/Commands (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Authorization Checks for Custom Actions):**

*   **Attack Vector: Bypass Authorization Checks for Custom Actions (HIGH-RISK LEAF, CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   **Description:** The application implements custom actions or commands (often triggered by specific input patterns). If the authorization checks for these actions are flawed or missing, an attacker can craft requests to execute actions they are not authorized to perform. This is especially critical if authorization is handled solely on the client-side.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Performing unauthorized actions, accessing sensitive data, modifying application state, escalating privileges.
    *   **Example:** Modifying a request to execute an administrative command without having the necessary administrative privileges.

These high-risk paths and critical nodes represent the most significant threats associated with using SlackTextViewController. Focusing mitigation efforts on these areas will provide the most effective security improvements.
