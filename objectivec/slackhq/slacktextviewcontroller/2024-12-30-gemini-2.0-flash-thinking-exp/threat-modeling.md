### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving SlackTextViewController

This document outlines high and critical security threats that directly involve the `SlackTextViewController` library.

*   **Threat:** Markdown Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious Markdown code within the text input field provided by `SlackTextViewController`. The library's rendering engine processes this code, potentially leading to the execution of unintended actions within the context where the rendered output is displayed. This could involve injecting `javascript:` URLs or malicious `<img>` tags.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): If the rendered output is displayed in a web view or similar component, the injected JavaScript can execute in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
        *   Information Disclosure: Malicious links or images could be used to track user activity or leak information about their environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Markdown Rendering Engine (within `SlackTextViewController`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization within `SlackTextViewController` Usage:** When using the library, ensure that the application sanitizes user-provided Markdown input *before* it is passed to the rendering engine of `SlackTextViewController`. Utilize a robust Markdown parsing library that allows for stripping potentially harmful elements and attributes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Rendered Output:** If the rendered output is displayed in a web view, implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts and other resources can be loaded, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.
        *   **Disable or Restrict Potentially Dangerous Markdown Features (if configurable within `SlackTextViewController` or the chosen rendering engine):** If the underlying Markdown rendering engine allows configuration, disable features like raw HTML embedding or `javascript:` URLs.

*   **Threat:** Excessive Input Length Leading to Client-Side Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely long text input through the `SlackTextViewController` input field. The library's handling or rendering of this excessive input could overwhelm the client-side resources, leading to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing on the user's device.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Client-Side Denial of Service: The application becomes unusable for the user.
        *   Poor User Experience: Significant performance degradation can occur even if the application doesn't fully crash.
    *   **Affected Component:** Text Input Handling and Rendering (within `SlackTextViewController`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Input Length Limits within `SlackTextViewController` Configuration or Application Logic:** Configure `SlackTextViewController` (if it offers such options) or implement application-level checks to enforce a reasonable maximum length for text input.
        *   **Efficient Rendering within `SlackTextViewController`:** Ensure that the library's rendering logic is efficient and can handle large amounts of text gracefully without causing excessive resource consumption. Consider if the library offers options for optimizing rendering performance.

*   **Threat:** UI Spoofing through Custom Elements
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages the customization capabilities of `SlackTextViewController` to create deceptive UI elements that mimic legitimate application features. This could trick users into performing actions they wouldn't otherwise take, such as entering credentials or sensitive information within what appears to be a genuine part of the application's interface provided by the library.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Phishing: Users might be tricked into entering sensitive information into fake UI elements controlled by the attacker.
        *   Social Engineering: Attackers could manipulate users into performing actions that benefit them by presenting a misleading interface.
    *   **Affected Component:** UI Customization Features (within `SlackTextViewController`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Review and Restriction of Custom UI Elements:** Thoroughly review and validate any custom UI elements implemented using `SlackTextViewController`. Limit the ability to create elements that could easily be mistaken for core application functionality.
        *   **Clear Visual Cues and Branding:** Ensure that legitimate UI elements provided by the application have clear and consistent visual cues and branding that distinguish them from potentially malicious custom elements.
        *   **Security Audits of UI Customization Implementation:** Conduct security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities in how UI customization is implemented and used within the application in conjunction with `SlackTextViewController`.
