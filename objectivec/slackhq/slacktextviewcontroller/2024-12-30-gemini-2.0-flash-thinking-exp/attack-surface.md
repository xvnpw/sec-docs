*   **Attack Surface:** Markdown Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Markdown code into user input fields that are rendered by `SlackTextViewController`.
    *   **How SlackTextViewController Contributes:** The library's core functionality is rendering Markdown. If the input is not sanitized before rendering, it becomes vulnerable to malicious Markdown.
    *   **Example:** A user enters `[Click Me](javascript:alert('XSS'))` in the text input. When rendered, this could execute JavaScript within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical. Could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript, steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's handling of rendered content).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization on the server-side and client-side *before* passing the input to `SlackTextViewController` for rendering. Use a well-vetted Markdown sanitization library or carefully define allowed Markdown tags and attributes.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts. This is a general application security measure but crucial when rendering user-provided content.
        *   **Contextual Output Encoding:** Ensure that rendered content is properly encoded for the output context (e.g., HTML encoding). This should ideally happen *after* `SlackTextViewController` renders the Markdown.

*   **Attack Surface:** Autocompletion/Mention Exploitation
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the autocompletion or mention functionality to inject malicious content or trigger unintended actions.
    *   **How SlackTextViewController Contributes:** The library provides the UI and logic for autocompletion and mentions. If the data source for suggestions or the handling of selected suggestions is flawed *within the library's implementation or the way the application integrates with it*, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a username or suggestion that, when autocompleted *via the library's functionality*, injects malicious Markdown or triggers an unintended API call.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Could lead to the injection of malicious content, phishing attacks, or unintended actions being performed on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if actions triggered are critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize Autocompletion Data:** Sanitize the data used for autocompletion suggestions *before* it's presented by `SlackTextViewController`.
        *   **Validate User Selection:** Validate the user's selection from the autocompletion list *after* it's provided by the library to ensure it matches expected formats and doesn't contain malicious payloads.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on autocompletion requests to prevent abuse. This is more of an application-level mitigation.
        *   **Secure Data Source Management:** Ensure the data source for autocompletion is trusted and properly secured. This is an application-level concern.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious File Upload via Attachment
    *   **Description:** Users can upload malicious files through the attachment functionality provided by or integrated with `SlackTextViewController`.
    *   **How SlackTextViewController Contributes:** The library provides the UI elements and potentially some handling for file attachments, making it the entry point for this attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads an executable file disguised as an image or a file containing malware through the attachment interface provided by the library.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical. Could lead to malware distribution, server compromise, or data breaches, depending on how the uploaded files are handled and stored.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on backend handling).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation of uploaded files, including file type, size, and content. This is crucial as the library itself likely doesn't perform comprehensive validation.
        *   **Anti-Virus Scanning:** Integrate with anti-virus scanning solutions to scan uploaded files for malware. This happens outside the library.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store uploaded files in a secure location with appropriate access controls. This is an application-level concern.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure CSP to restrict the execution of scripts from user-uploaded content domains.
        *   **File Name Sanitization:** Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal or other injection attacks. This should be done on the server-side after the upload.

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal in Attachment Handling
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate file paths related to attachments to access or overwrite unintended files.
    *   **How SlackTextViewController Contributes:** If the library allows specifying or manipulating file paths for attachments (either for uploading or displaying) *within its own functionality*, vulnerabilities can arise if these paths are not properly sanitized *by the library itself*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a file path like `../../../../etc/passwd` during an upload or download process initiated through the library's interface.
    *   **Impact:** High. Could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, data breaches, or even system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Path Validation:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of all file paths related to attachments *within the application's handling of attachments initiated by the library*.
        *   **Avoid User-Provided Paths:** Whenever possible, avoid allowing users to directly specify file paths. Use internal identifiers or controlled storage mechanisms. This is a design principle for the application using the library.
        *   **Chroot Environments:** Consider using chroot environments or similar techniques to isolate file operations. This is a server-side security measure.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Underlying Dependencies
    *   **Description:** `SlackTextViewController` relies on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies can indirectly introduce attack surfaces.
    *   **How SlackTextViewController Contributes:** By including and using these dependencies, the application inherits any vulnerabilities present in them, and these vulnerabilities can be triggered through the library's features.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a Markdown parsing library used by `SlackTextViewController` could be exploited through crafted Markdown input processed by the library.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability. Could range from low to critical.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (monitor dependency vulnerabilities) - can be Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `SlackTextViewController` and its dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to the libraries used by `SlackTextViewController`.
