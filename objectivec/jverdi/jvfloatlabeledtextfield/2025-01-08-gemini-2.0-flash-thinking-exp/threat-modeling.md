# Threat Model Analysis for jverdi/jvfloatlabeledtextfield

## Threat: [Misleading Information Display via DOM Manipulation](./threats/misleading_information_display_via_dom_manipulation.md)

* **Threat:** Misleading Information Display via DOM Manipulation
    * **Description:** An attacker could use JavaScript to directly manipulate the DOM elements created by `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` to alter the text or appearance of the floating label. This allows for displaying deceptive information, obscuring the actual input field's purpose, or showing false instructions directly within the label.
    * **Impact:** Users can be tricked into entering incorrect or sensitive information into the wrong fields, believing they are interacting with a legitimate element. This can lead to data breaches, account compromise, or other significant security violations.
    * **Affected Component:** DOM elements created by the library for the floating label (specifically the element containing the label text).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to strictly control the sources of JavaScript and prevent inline scripts that could be used for malicious DOM manipulation.
        * Sanitize and validate any user-controlled data that might indirectly influence the content or attributes of the label, although direct DOM manipulation bypasses this to some extent.
        * Regularly audit the application's JavaScript code for potential vulnerabilities that could enable unauthorized DOM manipulation.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Outdated Library](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_library.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Outdated Library
    * **Description:** If the `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` library contains known security vulnerabilities due to being outdated, attackers can exploit these flaws if the application uses a vulnerable version. These vulnerabilities could be within the library's JavaScript code itself.
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability present in the outdated version of the library. It could range from cross-site scripting (XSS) if the library improperly handles or renders user input, to other code execution possibilities depending on the nature of the flaw.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` library codebase.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Prioritize regular updates:**  Keep the `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` library updated to the latest stable version. This is the most crucial mitigation.
        * **Monitor for security advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to JavaScript libraries to be informed of any newly discovered issues.
        * **Use dependency management tools:** Employ tools that can help identify outdated dependencies and facilitate the update process.
