## Mitigation Strategy: [Accessibility Compliance (Direct `JVFloatLabeledTextField` Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/accessibility_compliance__direct__jvfloatlabeledtextfield__handling_.md)

1.  **Mitigation Strategy:** Accessibility Compliance (Direct `JVFloatLabeledTextField` Handling)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Initial Setup:**
            *   When initializing the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` instance, *directly* set its `accessibilityLabel` property.  This provides the primary description for screen readers.  Example (Swift):
                ```swift
                let emailField = JVFloatLabeledTextField()
                emailField.accessibilityLabel = "Email Address"
                ```
            *   Set the `accessibilityHint` property *on the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`* to provide additional context, if necessary.  Example:
                ```swift
                emailField.accessibilityHint = "Enter your registered email address"
                ```
        2.  **Dynamic Updates:**
            *   If the floating label's text (the `title` property of `JVFloatLabeledTextField`) changes dynamically to display an error message, *immediately* update the `accessibilityLabel` of the *same `JVFloatLabeledTextField` instance* to reflect the error.  Example:
                ```swift
                if emailField.text?.isValidEmail() == false {
                    emailField.title = "Invalid Email" // Assuming you modify the title
                    emailField.accessibilityLabel = "Email Address - Invalid format"
                }
                ```
            *   Consider using `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` with `.announcement` *in conjunction with the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`*, to ensure the error is clearly announced. This is *related* to the component, as it's triggered by the component's state.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Indirect, Component-Specific):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents screen readers from misinterpreting the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` due to incorrect or missing accessibility information, specifically related to the dynamic floating label.
        *   **Accessibility Violations (Component Level):** (Severity: Low, but legally important) - Ensures the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` component itself is accessible, contributing to overall application accessibility.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced for this specific component.  Screen reader users get accurate information about the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`'s state.
        *   **Accessibility Violations:** Risk related to the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` is eliminated (assuming thorough implementation).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `accessibilityLabel` is set during initialization in `UserProfileViewController.swift` and `RegistrationViewController.swift` *for the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` instances*.
        *   No dynamic updates to the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`'s `accessibilityLabel` are performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Dynamic updates to the `accessibilityLabel` *of the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` instances* are missing in all view controllers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Labeling (Direct `JVFloatLabeledTextField` Properties)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_labeling__direct__jvfloatlabeledtextfield__properties_.md)

2.  **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Labeling (Direct `JVFloatLabeledTextField` Properties)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Clear `placeholder` and `title`:**
            *   When creating the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`, set its `placeholder` and `title` properties to text that *clearly and unambiguously* describes the expected input.  These are the *direct properties* of the component that control its visual labeling.  Example:
                ```swift
                let firstNameField = JVFloatLabeledTextField()
                firstNameField.placeholder = "First Name"
                firstNameField.title = "First Name" // Floating label text
                ```
        2.  **Avoid Sensitive Terms in `placeholder` and `title`:**
            *   Do *not* use terms like "Password," "PIN," etc., in the `placeholder` or `title` properties of the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` unless the field is *absolutely* intended for that sensitive data.  This directly controls what the user sees as the label.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Phishing (Indirect, Component-Specific):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` itself being used to mislead users due to its displayed labels.
        *   **User Error (Component Level):** (Severity: Low) - Helps prevent users from entering the wrong data into the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` due to unclear labeling *on the component itself*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Phishing:** Risk reduced by ensuring the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`'s own labels are not misleading.
        *   **User Error:** Risk reduced at the component level by providing clear labels directly on the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Most `JVFloatLabeledTextField` instances have reasonably clear `placeholder` and `title` values.
        *   No specific documented check to ensure sensitive terms are avoided in the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`'s properties.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A review of all `JVFloatLabeledTextField` instances to ensure their `placeholder` and `title` properties are unambiguous and avoid sensitive terms is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Customization and Testing (of `JVFloatLabeledTextField`)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_customization_and_testing__of__jvfloatlabeledtextfield__.md)

3. **Mitigation Strategy:** Careful Customization and Testing (of `JVFloatLabeledTextField`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Minimize Customizations:**
            *   If you customize the appearance or behavior of `JVFloatLabeledTextField` (beyond basic properties like `placeholder` and `title`), keep those customizations as minimal as possible.  The more you deviate from the default, the higher the risk of introducing issues.
        2.  **Thorough Testing:**
            *   *Specifically test* any customizations made to the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`. This includes visual testing, functional testing, and performance testing.  Focus on how your changes affect the component's behavior.
        3.  **Code Review:**
            *   Have another developer review any code that customizes the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`, looking for potential errors or unintended side effects.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unexpected Component Behavior:** (Severity: Variable, potentially Medium) - Reduces the risk of customizations introducing bugs or unexpected behavior in the `JVFloatLabeledTextField` itself.
        *   **Performance Issues (Component-Specific):** (Severity: Low to Medium) - Helps identify and prevent performance problems caused by customizations to the `JVFloatLabeledTextField`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unexpected Component Behavior:** Risk reduced by careful coding and testing of customizations.
        *   **Performance Issues:** Risk reduced by identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks related to the customized component.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic customizations (e.g., font, color) are used in some view controllers.
        *   No specific, documented testing procedure focuses on `JVFloatLabeledTextField` customizations.
        *   No formal code review process specifically targets `JVFloatLabeledTextField` customizations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A dedicated testing plan for `JVFloatLabeledTextField` customizations is missing.
        *   A formal code review process for these customizations is missing.
