# Threat Model Analysis for jverdi/jvfloatlabeledtextfield

## Threat: [Visual Label Spoofing](./threats/visual_label_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, through a compromised dependency *within* the `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` library itself, or through runtime manipulation that specifically targets the library's code, modifies the appearance or text of the floating label *after* the user has begun interacting with the text field. The attacker could change "Password" to "Username," deceiving the user. This is distinct from application-level vulnerabilities; it assumes the attacker has compromised the *component's* code.
*   **Impact:** Users may enter sensitive information into the wrong field, leading to credential theft or other data breaches. The user's trust in the application is compromised.
*   **Affected Component:** The `UILabel` used to display the floating label, and the animation/transition logic *within the jvfloatlabeledtextfield library* that controls its position and appearance (e.g., methods related to `layoutSubviews`, animation blocks, or custom drawing code).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing (for library maintainers):** The *maintainers* of `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` must rigorously audit their own dependencies for vulnerabilities. This is crucial to prevent supply-chain attacks.
    *   **Code Review (for library maintainers):** Thorough code reviews of any changes to the `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` library are essential to catch potential vulnerabilities before they are introduced.
    *   **Runtime Integrity Checks (Limited Applicability):** While difficult to implement *within* a library, consider exploring techniques to detect if the library's code has been tampered with at runtime. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    * **Secure Coding Practices (for library maintainers):** Follow secure coding best practices to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities in the first place.

## Threat: [Runtime Label Text Tampering (Directly within the Library)](./threats/runtime_label_text_tampering__directly_within_the_library_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to visual spoofing, but specifically targeting the *text content* of the label. An attacker with runtime access, and *specifically targeting the jvfloatlabeledtextfield code*, directly modifies the `text` property of the `UILabel` representing the floating label. This assumes the attacker is able to inject code or modify memory *within the context of the running library*.
*   **Impact:** Users may be misled into entering incorrect or sensitive data, leading to security breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** The `UILabel` instance used for the floating label *within the jvfloatlabeledtextfield library*, specifically its `text` property.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Runtime Integrity Checks (Limited Applicability, for library maintainers):** As above, explore techniques to detect tampering with the library's code at runtime. This is challenging but can provide an additional layer of defense.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices (for library maintainers):** Minimize the attack surface by writing robust, well-tested code. Avoid unnecessary complexity or features that could be exploited.
    * **Obfuscation (Limited Effectiveness, for library maintainers):** Consider code obfuscation to make it *slightly* harder for an attacker to reverse engineer and modify the library's code. This is not a strong security measure on its own.
