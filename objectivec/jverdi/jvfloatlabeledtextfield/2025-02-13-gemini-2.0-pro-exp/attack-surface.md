# Attack Surface Analysis for jverdi/jvfloatlabeledtextfield

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass client-side input restrictions to submit malicious or invalid data to the server.
*   **jvfloatlabeledtextfield Contribution:** The component's primary function is visual (the floating label). It relies on standard HTML attributes and potentially custom JavaScript for validation, *both of which can be bypassed by an attacker*. It does not inherently enforce server-side validation.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses browser developer tools to remove the `required` attribute or change the `type` attribute of the input field, then submits invalid data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption.
    *   Application instability.
    *   Potential for further attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) if the server doesn't handle the invalid input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation:** *Mandatory* comprehensive server-side validation of *all* input received. This is the *critical* defense. Validate data types, lengths, formats, and allowed values.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all input on the server-side to prevent code injection attacks.
    *   **Server-Side Rendering of Validation Rules (Optional):** If possible, render validation attributes (e.g., `maxlength`) from the server to make client-side tampering harder.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Input](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_input.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send excessively large input values to overwhelm server resources or cause application crashes.
*   **jvfloatlabeledtextfield Contribution:** The component *might* use the `maxlength` HTML attribute, but this is a *client-side only* control. The component itself does *not* prevent an attacker from sending a large payload directly to the server (bypassing the client).
*   **Example:** An attacker uses `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request with an extremely long string in the text field, bypassing the client-side form and any `maxlength` attribute.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Server resource exhaustion (CPU, memory).
    *   Application unavailability.
    *   Potential database corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Length Limits:** Enforce *strict* and appropriate length limits on the server-side, *completely independent* of any client-side controls.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from flooding the server with requests, regardless of the size of the input.
    *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):** Validate input size *before* any further processing.
