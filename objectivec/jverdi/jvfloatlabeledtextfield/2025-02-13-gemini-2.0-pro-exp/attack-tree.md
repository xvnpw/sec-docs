## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_bypass.md)

This is a high-risk path because it represents the primary way an attacker can manipulate the application's data or behavior. Bypassing input validation allows the attacker to submit data that the application is not expecting, potentially leading to various vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Validation Circumvention (Assuming Client-Side Checks are Mirrored)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_validation_circumvention__assuming_client-side_checks_are_mirrored_.md)

This is the most critical node in the entire attack tree. Client-side validation is easily bypassed, so server-side validation is the *only* reliable defense against malicious input. If the server-side validation is weak, inconsistent with the client-side validation, or non-existent, the attacker has a high chance of success.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify discrepancies between client-side and server-side validation logic.](./attack_tree_paths/identify_discrepancies_between_client-side_and_server-side_validation_logic.md)

This is the attacker's primary goal when attempting to circumvent server-side validation. They will analyze the client-side code (JavaScript) to understand the validation rules and then try to craft requests that bypass those rules while still being accepted by the server.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the quality of server-side validation and whether it mirrors client-side checks.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Successful circumvention can lead to data corruption, injection attacks, and other severe vulnerabilities.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of both client-side and server-side code, and the ability to craft HTTP requests.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium (Requires knowledge of web application security, HTTP, and potentially server-side programming languages.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Can be detected through server logs, intrusion detection systems, and by monitoring for anomalous data.)

## Attack Tree Path: [Send crafted requests directly to the server, bypassing the client-side component.](./attack_tree_paths/send_crafted_requests_directly_to_the_server__bypassing_the_client-side_component.md)

The attacker uses tools like Burp Suite, ZAP, or even `curl` to send HTTP requests directly to the server, bypassing the `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` component and any client-side validation it performs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

XSS is a high-risk vulnerability because it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other serious consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reflected XSS (If input is directly reflected without sanitization)](./attack_tree_paths/reflected_xss__if_input_is_directly_reflected_without_sanitization_.md)

Reflected XSS occurs when user input is immediately returned by the application without proper sanitization, typically in an error message or search result.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject script tags into the input field, hoping the component renders them.](./attack_tree_paths/inject_script_tags_into_the_input_field__hoping_the_component_renders_them.md)

This is the critical step for a reflected XSS attack. The attacker tries to inject HTML `<script>` tags (or other methods of executing JavaScript) into the input field. If the application doesn't properly sanitize this input before displaying it, the injected script will be executed.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (If proper input sanitization and output encoding are implemented.)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Can lead to complete account takeover and other severe consequences.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Injecting script tags is relatively easy.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Requires basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Can be detected by web application firewalls, security scanners, and by monitoring for unusual JavaScript execution.)

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application.](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_javascript_in_the_context_of_the_application.md)

If the script injection is successful, the attacker's JavaScript code will run in the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored XSS (If input is stored and later displayed using the component)](./attack_tree_paths/stored_xss__if_input_is_stored_and_later_displayed_using_the_component_.md)

Stored XSS occurs when user input is stored by the application (e.g., in a database) and later displayed to other users without proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject script tags into the input field, which are stored and later rendered by the component.](./attack_tree_paths/inject_script_tags_into_the_input_field__which_are_stored_and_later_rendered_by_the_component.md)

This is the critical step for a stored XSS attack. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the input field, and the application stores this input. Later, when another user views the data containing the injected script, the script will be executed in their browser.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (If proper input sanitization and output encoding are implemented.)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Can lead to widespread account takeover and other severe consequences, affecting multiple users.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Injecting script tags is relatively easy.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Requires basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Can be detected by web application firewalls, security scanners, and by monitoring for unusual JavaScript execution.)

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application for other users.](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_javascript_in_the_context_of_the_application_for_other_users.md)

The injected script executes in the browsers of other users who view the compromised data, allowing the attacker to perform actions on their behalf.
