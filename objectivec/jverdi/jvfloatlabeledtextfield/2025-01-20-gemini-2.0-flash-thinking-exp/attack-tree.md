## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via jvfloatlabeledtextfield](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_jvfloatlabeledtextfield.md)

* **Critical Node: Compromise Application via jvfloatlabeledtextfield**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete security failure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Critical Node: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities**
    * This category represents the most direct and impactful way to compromise the application through the `jvfloatlabeledtextfield`. It encompasses vulnerabilities related to how the application processes user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Input](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_input.md)

* **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Input**
    * This node represents the attacker's ability to insert harmful data into the application through the input fields. Success here can lead to code execution or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payload](./attack_tree_paths/inject_cross-site_scripting__xss__payload.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payload**
    * Attack Vectors:
        * The attacker crafts a malicious script, often in JavaScript, and enters it into a text field managed by `jvfloatlabeledtextfield`.
        * The application, critically, fails to sanitize this input before rendering it in a web page.
        * When another user views the page containing the unsanitized input, their browser executes the malicious script.
    * Critical Node Enabling This Path:
        * **Application Renders Input Without Proper Sanitization:** This is the fundamental flaw that allows XSS to occur. If the application properly encodes or escapes user input before displaying it, the injected script will be treated as plain text.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Client-Side Validation](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_client-side_validation.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Bypass Client-Side Validation**
    * Attack Vectors:
        * **Manipulate DOM to Alter Input Values After Client-Side Validation:**
            * The application implements client-side validation using JavaScript.
            * The attacker uses browser developer tools (or similar techniques) to modify the input field's value *after* the client-side validation has passed but before the form is submitted.
            * The server-side, lacking its own validation, accepts the manipulated, invalid data.
        * **Disable JavaScript to Bypass Client-Side Validation:**
            * The application *only* relies on client-side validation.
            * The attacker disables JavaScript in their browser, rendering the client-side validation ineffective.
            * The attacker submits the form with invalid data, which the server-side, lacking validation, accepts.
    * Critical Node Enabling This Path:
        * **Client-Side Validation is the Only Security Measure:** This architectural flaw makes the application highly vulnerable to trivial bypass techniques. Server-side validation is essential as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inconsistent Input Handling Between Client and Server](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inconsistent_input_handling_between_client_and_server.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Exploit Inconsistent Input Handling Between Client and Server**
    * Attack Vectors:
        * The client-side validation implemented by the application has different rules or is less strict than the server-side validation.
        * The attacker crafts input that specifically passes the client-side checks (potentially using knowledge gained by observing label behavior or other client-side logic).
        * However, this crafted input is then mishandled or exploitable by the server-side processing logic due to the inconsistency in validation rules. This could lead to various server-side vulnerabilities like SQL injection (if the unsanitized input is used in a database query) or other backend logic flaws.
