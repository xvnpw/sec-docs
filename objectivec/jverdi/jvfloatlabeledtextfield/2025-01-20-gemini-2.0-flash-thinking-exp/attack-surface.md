# Attack Surface Analysis for jverdi/jvfloatlabeledtextfield

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Label Text](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_label_text.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the application that are then rendered within the context of the user's browser due to the application's improper handling of data used for the floating label or placeholder.
    *   **How jvfloatlabeledtextfield Contributes:** The library directly manipulates the DOM to display the floating label, often using the `placeholder` attribute or creating new elements. If the application populates these with unsanitized user-controlled data, the library will render the malicious script.
    *   **Example:** An application uses a URL parameter to pre-fill the text field's placeholder. An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious script in the parameter value (e.g., `?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`). The `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` library renders this script when the field is displayed.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Always sanitize user-provided data before using it to set the `placeholder` attribute or any content that will be rendered by `jvfloatlabeledtextfield`. This involves removing or escaping potentially harmful characters.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Encode data for HTML context before rendering it within the label or placeholder. This ensures that special characters are displayed as text and not interpreted as code.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Client-Side "Security" Measures](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_client-side_security_measures.md)

*   **Description:**  Any client-side "security" measures implemented within `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` (though unlikely for a UI component) should not be relied upon as the sole security mechanism. Client-side code is easily inspectable and modifiable by attackers.
    *   **How jvfloatlabeledtextfield Contributes:** If the library were to implement any form of client-side input sanitization or validation, developers might mistakenly believe this provides sufficient protection.
    *   **Example:**  If the library attempts to strip out `<script>` tags client-side, an attacker can easily bypass this by modifying the JavaScript or using alternative XSS vectors.
    *   **Impact:**  A false sense of security, leading to vulnerabilities if server-side validation is not implemented.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Validation is Mandatory:** Always perform robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side, regardless of any client-side checks.
        *   **Treat Client-Side as Untrusted:**  Never trust data originating from the client-side.
