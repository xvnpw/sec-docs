# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jverdi/jvfloatlabeledtextfield

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Server-Side Input Validation and Sanitization (in context of `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` usage)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_server-side_input_validation_and_sanitization__in_context_of__jvfloatlabeledtextfield__usage_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all input fields using `jvfloatlabeledtextfield`** that handle user-provided data.
    2.  **Ensure server-side validation logic is applied to *all* data** received from these fields, regardless of the visual presentation provided by `jvfloatlabeledtextfield`. Developers must not assume data is safe or valid simply because it's entered into a visually enhanced text field.
    3.  **Sanitize data received from `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` inputs** on the server-side to prevent injection attacks. This is crucial as `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` is purely a UI component and does not provide any inherent security against malicious input.
    4.  **Test input validation and sanitization specifically for data originating from `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` instances** to confirm that the UI component's use does not bypass or weaken backend security measures.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High Severity - Malicious SQL code injected via `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` inputs.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Severity - Malicious scripts injected via `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` inputs.
    *   **Command Injection:** Medium Severity -  If input from `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` is used in system commands.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium Severity - Invalid data entered through `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` corrupting application data.

*   **Impact:** High - Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks originating from user input via `jvfloatlabeledtextfield`.
