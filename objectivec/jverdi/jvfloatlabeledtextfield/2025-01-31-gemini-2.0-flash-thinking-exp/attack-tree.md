**Attack Vector:** A specific tactic within UI-based phishing where attackers craft misleading labels for `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` instances to trick users into entering credentials or other sensitive information.

**How it Works:** Attackers exploit the customizable nature of `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` labels to create fields that appear to be legitimate login prompts, password reset requests, or security verification steps.  The labels are designed to deceive users into believing they are interacting with a genuine system process.

**Potential Consequences:** Credential theft, account takeover, sensitive data compromise.

**Mitigations:**
*   All mitigations listed under "Phishing/Social Engineering via UI Manipulation" are directly applicable.
*   Pay extra attention to label wording and styling to ensure they cannot be misinterpreted as system prompts or security-related messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Crafting misleading labels to trick users into entering credentials or sensitive data in seemingly legitimate fields [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__crafting_misleading_labels_to_trick_users_into_entering_credentials_or_sensitive_data_in_seemingl_5de0c014.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Directly creating deceptive labels for `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` to facilitate credential harvesting.

**How it Works:** Attackers focus on the label text itself, carefully wording it to mimic trusted prompts or requests. This can be combined with UI manipulation of surrounding content to enhance the deception.
