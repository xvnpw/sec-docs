# Threat Model Analysis for jverdi/jvfloatlabeledtextfield

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Label Manipulation](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_label_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the floating label text of a `jvfloatlabeledtextfield`. This is possible if the application dynamically sets the label content based on unsanitized user input or external data and the library renders this unsanitized content without proper escaping. When the label is rendered by the library, the injected JavaScript code executes in the user's browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the application.

**Impact:** User account compromise, theft of sensitive data, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and potential for further attacks on the user's system.

**Affected Component:** Label Rendering, potentially API for setting label text (within `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` library and application code using it). Specifically, the part of the library responsible for rendering the floating label and how it handles the label text content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Label Content Control:** Ensure that the content of the floating label is always controlled by the application's code and is *never* directly derived from unsanitized user input or external data. Treat label content as static or programmatically generated from trusted sources.
*   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** If dynamic label content is absolutely necessary, implement robust output encoding or escaping in your application code *before* setting the label text using the library's API.  Ensure that any user-provided or external data is treated as plain text and properly escaped for HTML context before being used as label text.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities. CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts, limiting the attacker's ability to inject and execute malicious code even if an XSS vulnerability exists.
*   **Library Code Review (if feasible):** If possible and necessary, review the `jvfloatlabeledtextfield` library's source code to understand exactly how it handles label text rendering and confirm that it does not introduce any inherent XSS vulnerabilities. However, relying on application-side sanitization is the primary and recommended mitigation.
