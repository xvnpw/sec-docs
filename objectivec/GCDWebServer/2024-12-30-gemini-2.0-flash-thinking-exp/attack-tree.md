**Threat Model: Compromising Application Using GCDWebServer - High-Risk Sub-Tree**

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to the application's data or functionality by exploiting vulnerabilities within the GCDWebServer library.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

- Compromise Application Using GCDWebServer
    - OR - Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
        - AND - Send Malformed HTTP Requests
            - OR - Exploit Path Traversal *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    - OR - Exploit Insecure Data Handling *** CRITICAL NODE ***
        - AND - Access Sensitive Information via Unprotected Endpoints *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
    - OR - Exploit Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
        - AND - Perform Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks *** CRITICAL NODE ***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities -> Send Malformed HTTP Requests**

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft and send HTTP requests with malformed or unexpected data in the URL, headers, or body. GCDWebServer's failure to properly validate this input can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to access unauthorized files (path traversal), inject malicious content (header injection), or cause unexpected server behavior.

**Critical Node: Exploit Path Traversal**

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the requested URL, often using ".." sequences, to access files and directories outside the intended web root.
- **Potential Impact:**  Attackers can read sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data. In some cases, if write access is also compromised or if uploaded files can be accessed, it can lead to remote code execution.

**Critical Node: Exploit Insecure Data Handling**

- **Attack Vector:** The application, potentially in conjunction with GCDWebServer's handling of requests, exposes sensitive information through unprotected endpoints. This means that accessing these endpoints does not require proper authentication or authorization.
- **Potential Impact:** Direct exposure of sensitive application data, user information, API keys, or other confidential details.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Data Handling -> Access Sensitive Information via Unprotected Endpoints**

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly send requests to specific URLs or endpoints that, due to misconfiguration or design flaws, serve sensitive information without requiring authentication or authorization.
- **Potential Impact:**  Immediate and direct access to confidential data, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities -> Perform Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers intentionally overwhelm the GCDWebServer instance with a flood of requests or by sending requests that consume excessive server resources.
- **Potential Impact:**  The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users, leading to service disruption, loss of revenue, and damage to reputation.

**Critical Node: Perform Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**

- **Attack Vector:** Attackers employ various techniques to make the server unavailable. This can include:
    - **Connection Exhaustion:** Opening a large number of connections and keeping them open, exceeding the server's capacity.
    - **Request Processing Overload:** Sending a high volume of complex or large requests that consume excessive CPU, memory, or network bandwidth.
- **Potential Impact:**  Complete or significant disruption of the application's functionality, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.
