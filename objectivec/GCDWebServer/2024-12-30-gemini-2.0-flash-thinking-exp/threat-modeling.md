Here are the high and critical threats directly involving `GCDWebServer`:

*   **Threat:** Malformed Request Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with malformed headers or an excessively long URL. `GCDWebServer`'s parsing logic might fail to handle this gracefully, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) or a crash, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, disrupting service availability for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `GCDWebServer`'s HTTP request parsing module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement request size limits within the application.
        *   Configure timeouts for request processing.
        *   Consider using a more robust HTTP parsing library in front of `GCDWebServer` for pre-processing and sanitization if feasible.
        *   Monitor server resource usage for anomalies.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via File Serving
    *   **Description:** If the application uses `GCDWebServer` to serve static files and doesn't properly sanitize user-provided file paths, an attacker can craft a request with ".." sequences to access files outside the intended directory root. This could expose sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories on the server. Potential for data breach or further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `GCDWebServer`'s file serving logic (specifically how it resolves file paths).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly use user input to construct file paths.
        *   Use secure path manipulation functions provided by the operating system or language to canonicalize and validate paths.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed directories for file serving.
        *   Ensure the application runs with the least privileges necessary.

*   **Threat:** Header Injection in Responses
    *   **Description:** If the application uses user-controlled input to set HTTP response headers through `GCDWebServer`, an attacker can inject malicious headers. This could be used to set arbitrary cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or exploit vulnerabilities in the client's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other client-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** `GCDWebServer`'s HTTP response header setting functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct response headers.
        *   If user input must be used, strictly sanitize and validate it to remove potentially harmful characters or header directives.
        *   Use the library's built-in methods for setting standard headers securely.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Built-in Authentication/Authorization
    *   **Description:** `GCDWebServer` itself does not provide built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms. If the application relies solely on `GCDWebServer` for security, it will be completely open to unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and its data.
    *   **Affected Component:** The lack of security features in `GCDWebServer`'s core design.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within the application logic.
        *   Do not rely on `GCDWebServer` for access control.
