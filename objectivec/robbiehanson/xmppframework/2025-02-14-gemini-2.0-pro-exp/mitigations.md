## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure XML Parsing (within `xmppframework`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_xml_parsing__within__xmppframework__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate `NSXMLParser` Initialization:**  Find where `xmppframework` creates and configures its `NSXMLParser` instances (likely within `XMPPStream` or related classes).
    2.  **Apply Secure Settings:** *Before* any XML parsing, set these properties on the `NSXMLParser` instance:
        *   `parser.shouldProcessNamespaces = YES;`
        *   `parser.shouldReportNamespacePrefixes = NO;`
        *   `parser.shouldResolveExternalEntities = NO;`  (Critical for XXE prevention)
    3.  **DTD Handling (If Absolutely Necessary):** If DTD validation is unavoidable (it usually isn't for XMPP):
        *   Bundle a *local, trusted* DTD file with the application.
        *   Configure the `NSXMLParser` to use *only* this local DTD.  *Never* allow remote DTDs. This might require a custom `NSURLProtocol`.
    4.  **Testing (xmppframework-Specific):** Create unit tests that feed malicious XML (XXE payloads) *through* the `xmppframework` components (e.g., by simulating server responses). Verify that the framework correctly rejects these inputs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Attackers can read local files, access internal resources, or potentially execute code.
    *   **Billion Laughs Attack (XML Bomb):** (Severity: High) - Denial of service via excessive memory consumption.
    *   **XML Denial of Service (XDoS):** (Severity: High) - Various XML-based attacks that consume resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XXE Injection:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible (with correct implementation).
    *   **Billion Laughs:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **XDoS:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (some attacks might still be possible).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Partially. Secure settings in `XMPPStream.m`, but DTD handling is not explicitly addressed.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) DTD handling needs secure configuration.  Unit tests specifically targeting `xmppframework`'s XML parsing are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict TLS/SSL Certificate Validation (within `xmppframework`)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_tlsssl_certificate_validation__within__xmppframework__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate `GCDAsyncSocketDelegate`:** Find the `GCDAsyncSocketDelegate` implementation used by `xmppframework`.
    2.  **Implement `socket:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler:`:**  This is the *critical* method. Within it:
        *   **Obtain Certificate Chain:** Get the `SecTrustRef` from the `trust` parameter.
        *   **Validate Chain:** Use `SecTrustEvaluateWithError` to validate the chain against the system trust store *and* any custom CA certificates (if used).
        *   **Hostname Verification:** Extract the server's hostname (CN or SAN) from the certificate.  Compare this *strictly* against the expected XMPP server hostname. Reject wildcards unless absolutely necessary and carefully controlled.
        *   **Certificate Pinning (Optional, Highly Recommended):**
            *   Securely store the expected server certificate's public key hash (e.g., SHA-256).
            *   Calculate the hash of the presented certificate's public key.
            *   Compare the calculated hash with the stored hash. Reject if they don't match.
        *   **Completion Handler:** Call `completionHandler` with `YES` *only* if *all* checks pass; otherwise, `NO`.
    3.  **Custom CA (If Applicable):** Securely embed the CA's certificate. Load it and add it to the `SecTrustRef` before evaluation.
    4.  **Testing (xmppframework-Specific):** Create test cases that simulate MitM attacks with invalid certificates *specifically within the context of an `xmppframework` connection*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** (Severity: Critical) - Interception and modification of XMPP traffic.
    *   **Impersonation:** (Severity: Critical) - Attackers can impersonate the XMPP server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MitM Attack:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (with pinning) or Medium (without pinning).
    *   **Impersonation:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (with pinning) or Medium (without pinning).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Basic TLS is enabled, but hostname verification is not strict, and pinning is not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Strict hostname verification, certificate pinning, and `xmppframework`-specific MitM tests are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Stream Error Handling (within `xmppframework`)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_stream_error_handling__within__xmppframework__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement `XMPPStreamDelegate` Error Methods:** Implement *all* relevant error-handling methods in the `XMPPStreamDelegate`:
        *   `xmppStream:didNotAuthenticate:`
        *   `xmppStream:didFailToSendIQ:error:`
        *   `xmppStream:didFailToConnect:error:`
        *   `xmppStreamDidDisconnect:withError:`
        *   ...and others as needed.
    2.  **Secure Logging (within the Delegate):** Log errors, but *avoid* sensitive information (passwords, tokens) in the logs generated *within the delegate methods*.
    3.  **Graceful Termination:** For fatal errors, ensure the `XMPPStream` is properly closed (`[xmppStream disconnect]`) and resources are released *from within the delegate*.
    4.  **Testing (xmppframework-Specific):** Simulate error conditions (invalid credentials, server errors) *that trigger `xmppframework`'s delegate methods* and verify correct handling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents unresponsiveness due to errors.
    *   **Information Leakage:** (Severity: Low) - Reduces risk of exposing sensitive information via `xmppframework`'s error reporting.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Some error handling is present, but it's not comprehensive.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Comprehensive implementation of all relevant delegate methods, secure logging within the delegate, and `xmppframework`-specific error simulation tests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation (Leveraging `xmppframework` API)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation__leveraging__xmppframework__api_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `xmppframework`'s Classes:**  *Always* use `xmppframework`'s provided classes (e.g., `XMPPMessage`, `XMPPIQ`, `XMPPPresence`) to construct and parse stanzas. *Avoid* manual XML string manipulation.
    2.  **Use Accessor Methods:** When extracting data, use methods like `stringValue`, `attributeStringValueForName:`, etc.  These methods often provide some level of built-in handling.
    3.  **Context-Specific Escaping/Encoding (After Extraction):** *After* extracting data using `xmppframework`'s methods, apply appropriate escaping/encoding based on where the data will be used (UI, database, etc.). This is *crucial* even when using the framework's API.
    4.  **Testing (xmppframework-Specific):** Craft malicious XMPP stanzas and send them *through* `xmppframework` (simulating server responses). Verify that the data extracted using the framework's API, *combined with your escaping/encoding*, prevents injection attacks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - If data is displayed in a web view.
    *   **Injection Attacks (General):** (Severity: Medium to High)
    *   **Data Corruption:** (Severity: Low)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with proper escaping).
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced from Medium/High to Low.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) Basic escaping is used, but comprehensive validation and `xmppframework`-specific injection tests are missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Comprehensive input validation, and testing for injection attacks specifically through the `xmppframework` API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication (Using `xmppframework`'s SASL Support)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication__using__xmppframework_'s_sasl_support_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Strong SASL Mechanism:** Use `xmppframework`'s SASL support to implement a strong mechanism. Prefer SASL SCRAM-SHA-* (e.g., SCRAM-SHA-256) over weaker ones like PLAIN (unless TLS is *absolutely* guaranteed) or DIGEST-MD5.
    2.  **Configure `xmppframework`:** Ensure that `xmppframework` is configured to use the chosen SASL mechanism. This usually involves setting properties on the `XMPPStream` or related objects.
    3.  **Testing (xmppframework-Specific):** Test authentication with various credentials *using `xmppframework`'s API*. Verify that weak mechanisms are rejected and strong mechanisms work correctly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** (Severity: Critical)
    *   **Impersonation:** (Severity: Critical)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Impersonation:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) SASL PLAIN is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Switch to SASL SCRAM-SHA-*.  Test `xmppframework`'s authentication with various mechanisms.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular `xmppframework` Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular__xmppframework__updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift Package Manager).
    2.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly check for and apply updates to `xmppframework`.
    3.  **Security Advisories:** Monitor the `xmppframework` GitHub repository for security advisories.
    4.  **Testing (Post-Update):** *After updating*, thoroughly test the application, paying close attention to `xmppframework`-related functionality.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: Variable, can be Low to Critical) - Addresses vulnerabilities fixed in newer versions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from Variable to Negligible (for known and patched issues).

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example) CocoaPods is used, but updates are infrequent.

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example) Establish a regular update schedule. Monitor security advisories. Conduct thorough post-update testing focused on `xmppframework`.
