# Attack Surface Analysis for robbiehanson/xmppframework

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious XML containing external entity references to access local files, internal network resources, or cause denial of service.
*   **`xmppframework` Contribution:** The framework relies on `libxml2` for XML parsing, which, if misconfigured or outdated, is vulnerable to XXE.  `xmppframework` *directly* handles the XML parsing, making it the vulnerable component.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted XMPP message containing:
    ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
      <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
      <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
    <message to='victim@example.com'>
      <body>&xxe;</body>
    </message>
    ```
*   **Impact:**
    *   Disclosure of sensitive local files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files).
    *   Access to internal network services (SSRF).
    *   Denial of service (DoS) by exhausting server resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developer)** *Verify* that `libxml2` is configured within `xmppframework` to *disable* external entity resolution.  Check for the use of `XML_PARSE_NOENT` and `XML_PARSE_NONET` flags during XML parser initialization. This is the *primary* defense and is the responsibility of the code using `libxml2` (i.e., `xmppframework` or your wrapper around it).
    *   **(Developer)** Keep `libxml2` (as used by `xmppframework`) updated to the latest patched version.
    *   **(Developer)** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on *all* incoming XML data *after* `xmppframework` has parsed it, rejecting unexpected elements or attributes.
    *   **(Developer/Operations)** Use resource limits (memory, CPU) on XML parsing (within the context of how `xmppframework` uses it) to mitigate DoS.

## Attack Surface: [Stanza Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/stanza_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit differences in how XMPP servers and clients parse stanzas to inject malicious payloads or bypass security controls.
*   **`xmppframework` Contribution:** The framework is *directly* responsible for constructing and parsing XMPP stanzas. Bugs in this core functionality create the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a malformed stanza with crafted whitespace or character encoding that is interpreted differently by the client (using `xmppframework`) and the server.  This allows the attacker to inject a hidden command or bypass a filter. The specifics depend on parsing differences.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Bypassing security filters (e.g., message content filters).
    *   Injecting malicious commands or data.
    *   Potentially achieving remote code execution (RCE) in severe cases.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developer)** Keep `xmppframework` updated to the latest version.  The framework developers are responsible for addressing protocol-level parsing issues.
    *   **(Developer)** Implement robust input validation *after* `xmppframework` has parsed the stanza.  Don't rely solely on the framework. Check for unexpected elements, attributes, and data types.

## Attack Surface: [JID Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/jid_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers impersonate other users by forging their Jabber IDs (JIDs).
*   **`xmppframework` Contribution:** The framework *directly* handles JID parsing and, ideally, should provide mechanisms for validation.  Weaknesses in *its* handling of JIDs create the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a message with a `from` attribute set to `admin@example.com`, even if they don't control that account. If `xmppframework` doesn't provide the *authenticated* JID for comparison, or if the application developer doesn't use it, spoofing is possible.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Social engineering attacks.
    *   Unauthorized access to resources.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developer)** Ensure the application *explicitly* verifies that the `from` attribute of incoming messages matches the authenticated JID of the sender.  The framework *must* provide a way to access the authenticated JID; use that API.  Do *not* trust the `from` attribute in the raw stanza without verification against the authenticated identity provided by the framework.

## Attack Surface: [TLS Downgrade/Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/tls_downgrademisconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers force the client and server to use weaker or no TLS encryption, enabling man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **`xmppframework` Contribution:** The framework *directly* handles TLS negotiation and connection establishment.  Its configuration and implementation are crucial.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the initial XMPP connection and modifies the server's advertised features to remove TLS support. If `xmppframework` doesn't *enforce* TLS, the connection proceeds unencrypted.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Interception and modification of XMPP traffic.
    *   Credential theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developer)** *Explicitly* configure `xmppframework` to *require* TLS 1.2 or higher. Use the framework's API to enforce this.
    *   **(Developer)** Specify a strong cipher suite via `xmppframework`'s configuration options.
    *   **(Developer)** *Always* verify the server's certificate using the APIs provided by `xmppframework`. Implement certificate pinning if appropriate, again using the framework's capabilities if available.

## Attack Surface: [Weak SASL Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_sasl_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Using weak SASL mechanisms (e.g., PLAIN, DIGEST-MD5) exposes user credentials.
*   **`xmppframework` Contribution:** The framework *directly* implements and manages the SASL authentication process.  Allowing weak mechanisms, or not providing a way to restrict them, is a framework issue.
*   **Example:** If `xmppframework` allows the PLAIN mechanism, the password is sent in plain text (base64 encoded, but trivially decoded) over the connection.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Credential theft.
    *   Unauthorized account access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **(Developer)** Configure `xmppframework` via its API to *only* allow strong SASL mechanisms (SCRAM-SHA-256 or SCRAM-SHA-512).  Disable weaker mechanisms using the framework's configuration options. The framework *must* provide a way to control this.
